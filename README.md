# Ranger Game Reviewer
A tool for helping people determine whether or not a video game would be a good purchase for them. 

The goal of this tool is to use deep learning techniques to analyze YouTube game reviews, compare reviews from multiple textual sources, and compare the playtime of users with similar tastes in games to guesstimate if someone would enjoy a game, how many hours they should expect to get out of it, and at what price they would have to buy the game to "break even" on their investment (e.g. if a game is estimated to produce 60hrs of gameplay for that user they would 'break even' if they paid $60, using a ratio of $1:1hr).
