    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. \n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/reviews_ex.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg)."

      "[\"Aside the infuriating new game plus feature of permadeath (essentially corrupting your save if you die, considering the first part has the most instant death traps in the game this is frustrating) this game is one of the most satisfying games I've ever played.  Short, but with many hidden quirks.  Do be aware that the controls are a mimicry of 1980's platformers and thus really floaty and hard to get a handle on but the game is excellently made\\n\", 'Interesting game but I feel the movility and the way the enemies move is a bit extrange. For example when you use the blast attack with enemies a they are floating is extrange that some of them keep moving to you. The movement in battle dont fill very natural but If in a development state there are a lot of margin to improve the game.\\n', 'fun game with challenging bosses and cute art, expect lots of deaths\\n', 'Weyrwood combines two of my favourite things - navigating society and the supernatural. Beautifully written, with a large variety of choices in how to play. The characters are interesting and have their own troubles alongside your own, opening up the world just a little more. And with the spina system, everything seems a little more fraught and dangerous - simple matters such as buying ingredients for a meal take on a lot more meaning, as you dance the line between living and Falling. Truly, an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone.\\n', 'Good button\\n', \"The Nyakuza Metro dlc broke the game for linux users. If you're interested in playing this game on linux, please avoid.\\n\", '12\\n', \"Im going to split this review into three sections because I had very different experiences between the Nyakuza Metro, online party mode, and the overall characters/voiceacting in the game TL:DR at bottom of review  Nyazuka Metro: Its not a bad area, but it certainly does not stack up to the rest of the game. The entire area feels weird and wonky to go through and was just unenjoyable. The map itself is small, but it feels extremly empty aside from a few stickers to collect. Although Alpine Skyline was free roam, it didn't feel empty, it was just a bit slow to go through because of the ziplines. The mission had a lack of uniqueness within them, it was just go to a place and collect a time capsule. It was also incredibly short, shorter than The Arctic Cruise for me (which only has 3 time pieces btw) Probably the biggest disapointment was the lack of a final boss, it builds up to it, and then, nothing. Rumbi factory was fine though, probably the best shattered time piece yet.  Characters/voice acting: Its hard for me to criticize the cat characters as they fit in, but they feel really bland. Imagine the scottish things from alpine skyline expect without the accent and without them saying the same line. That may sound negative, but in gave the character meaning and made them stand out. The cats on the other hand are bland and just bland and unintresting, only really seeing uniqueness with their knock off yelp reviews. The empress I also was not a big fan of. She felt out of place in this game that never takes itself seriosuly. She felt like a queen ping with nothing funny or enjoyable about her. Again, just like the cats, they feel so out of place for the game. The voice acting for when you order food is nice, but its nothing to major when it comes to voice acting in this game.  Online multiplayer: It really depends on how you play this. 3-4 people online is not that problamatic, just longer loading times between levels and sometimes a bit of lag but thats no big deal. 30 people on the other hand is terrifying, random crashes, and insane rubber banding makes it an instant no go. Despite all that, I still enjoyed it, If you're all in a skype or discord call in can be insanely fun. Also, not really sure where to put this expect here, all the new costumes and flairs are all really cool. They feel more unique and original too from the base game(not death wish) the new badges are cool but no real reason to use them   Tl:DR The new world and acts are not worth replaying as it is extremly short and bland. The online multiplayer, if everyone has a stable connection, can be fun as there will be little lag. 30+ people online just doesn't work, 10 people seems to be the sweet spot before shit hits the fan. The new costumes are nice  and add to the asthetic. If you're a person without friends, I would not recommend this because the single payer is not enough the worth of €7, but online with 7-10 people and with the right people, can be extremly fun. Overall, single player, not worth€7 but multiplayer, can be a bit unstable with 15+ people, but if it connects right, extremly fun.\\n\", \"Very unique rouge-lite FPS unlike nothing you played before! The content feels a bit raw and there is some balance issues, but nothing game braking and its expected since its early access. Gameplay is fun and dynamic, mobs are interesting and cool looking. There's a lot of different guns, each one plays differently, but the ballistic can be irritating at times. Bosses are really cool! Each one has a solution to it, so its not just a bullet sponge. I will definitely stay tuned for new content!\\n\", 'I like that if can update more CG\\n', \"We're in a period of the games industry where cute, charming, and lighthearted games are either solely made by Nintendo or small independent developers. Frog Detective falls into the latter. Despite it's short length, it managed to be endearing and uplifting. Like one of those old child-centric point & click games from the 90s based on kid-friendly cartoons such as The Bernstein Bears. It tells a cute story, characters are friendly, and it's more about leaving a feel-good vibe than trying to match wits with Moriarty.  This is exactly what I was hoping it'd be, so Grace absolutely nailed her delivery. Even the couple of groan-worthy jokes made me laugh, perhaps especially those since they're often looked down upon by some people. I hope there will be another fun Frog Adventure down the road, or something even better. Although imagining something better than a polite frog solve mysteries is quite a difficult task.\\n\", 'All Civ Mac products seem to be plagued with performance issues of late and the full version is no exception. The game hangs, ignores commands for units and is generally as unplayable as the iOS version. I should have checked the mixed reviews more before spending my money on an unplayable game.\\n', \"This is a table with a lot of depth. Some of the shots are quite unforgiving unless you are very accurate or you figure out the timing. There is a flipper at the top which can feel quite underused. The layout isn't perfect, but it ticks all the boxes.  The undersea theme is represented very well by the sound effects and the updated graphics look very good indeed.  Overall, it's a good table for a seasoned player and also fun for the unseasoned. It's one of my favourites on Zaccaria, or any other pinball platform on Steam.\\n\", 'The devs are terrible, they banned their biggest youtuber for highlighting the issues this game has. Absolutely terrible.\\n', 'Rember, Outlaws are bad, they die and dont get the puss.\\n', 'Bad Game, While i am play and upload item in tek transmitter and the server down. all my mine is gone\\n', \"I just bought and played it and its awesome!  Pro: Fair fights, easy to use abilities, good looking and strong enemies, good graphics, understandable translation  Contra: too low ammo (for me :D), 1 graphic bug, too short, wierd translation, thats it (I had to think really hard about the contras)  I love this alpha and I'm hyped for the real game!\\n\", \"Pause is not cheating. Well I think this game need a replay. It's also nice if this game have achievements or trading cards (badge).\\n\", 'YES YES YES!!!!\\n', 'Amazing dlc for an amazing game. It adds Albania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary-each of those countries has a specific economical and political situation aswell as unique events. If you liked the basic game grab this dlc for sure. But beware- defending socialist system in all of added countries is a very challenging task, so good luck comrade! \\n', \"Clicked play, lost life.  11/10 would recommend, just grab a bucket or a bottle to piss in and you're good.\\n\", \"Not a bad start, honestly.   Played it on stream when someone suggested it, I expected an absolutely awful game but in all honesty, it's a good base for something bigger. Inital changes would be to have all of the controls in the same format at the tutorial- One wall is controller, other is for keyboard. Not a huge issue, just something that would make things feel a bit smoother. Camera could be made a little more forgivingly, it was like pushing a car trying to get the camera to rotate.  A few gameplay/story urks would be the ability to simply run from the beginning to end. I done this after some combat- it's super easy to exploit because of how the checkpoints have been laid out. Oh, also, the final boss fight is super anti-climatic- 9-10 hits and he was dead, no ending scene- no rewards- no indication that the game has ended.  Although the points raised in the review are negative, I did have a fair bit of fun while playing this game. I'd recommend for £0.79 :)\\n\", \"I'm not much of a reviewing person so here is what I thought. The way how the game works is not really my cup of tea and also the resolusion could be higher since I like it that way and pretty sure many others as well. However I like story and the content this gives me. It is interesting overall. Oh and also it would be awesome if you could move with your mouse not just keyboard.\\n\", \"Pretty short tbh. I still really enjoyed it, but i wouldn't mind more content. It is quite cheap though so it might not be that short compared to the price. I guess i just expected morre..   You SHOULD play this game when your home alone and in a dark room. (Kinda obvious but, use a headset with surround sound). This game no joke terrified me. It honestly made me so f**king paranoid, so maybe don't play it if you can't handle horror games?\\n\", 'This game controls amazingly and has partial mod support. I hope the community AND the devs continue creating new content for it.  Must own for Skating fans.\\n', \"the fine controls and true responsiveness/ real world physics make this game true to skateboarding. theres a very steep learning curve, but don't give up. its just like skateboarding, hard, to pick up and extremely rewarding when it all comes together.\\n\", \"Being a Civilization fan I already knew I was going to get all the expansions and when I saw the price I promised myself I would wait for a sale.I told myself don't buy it until it goes on sale,the game will still be there no one is going to pull it from steam,wait for a damn sale.That lasted for a bit then what happens,a pop up ad Steam gives you when you sign on pops up with an add,I swear they aimed it at me the add was bigger then usual and no one can tell me different.Still I clicked it off and Steam tricked me again(I know they have it out for me).I went to my library and Civilization IV was the first game I saw,after seeing that it made me think of the Gathering Storm DLC!Wiping away a bit of drool as fast as I can I said No damn it wait for the sale!So thinking quickly I clicked another game,I know I did (Steam has it out for me)the game that started was Civilization VI,no one can tell me different with the add for Gathering storm,grabbing tissues wiping more drool from my mouth I yelled(wife thinks I'm crazy now)Alright I'll buy it.  Don't put yourself through what I went through Just buy it NOW!\\n\", ' if love treasure games and run&gun this is definatly right up your ally  \\n', 'Not great but a nice addition to the game my only problem with this dlc is that to me it needs European university styles its very North American.\\n', \"I'm enjoying it. Don't expect the same quality as LISA (Story, Music, Tone, Atmosphere etc.) but it does keep the same battle system and I think the developer actually did a really good job at making each battle engaging. It's probably the best part of the game because each encounter is a challenge, even on the easiest difficulty you'll just barely scrape by. Every party member plays incredibly different from each other (some are completely useless) and you'll need to use pretty much every skill in your arsenal to survive. I like this because a lot of turn based RPGs let you just spam one move without much thought. So there's a bit of strategy and planning during battles, a nice surprise.  Some of the bigger issues I have with the game are the art and english translation, the art is inconsistent and often times looks god awful but overall it's just okay with some jarring dips in quality in certain areas. I'm not sure where the developer is from but there is A LOT of grammar issues and sentences that don't even make sense. If you're a grammar nazi then this game will trigger you more than the politically incorrect jokes.  There's also some google images of youtubers and politicians that pop up in one segment of the game, I'm not a fan of developers using real images in a pixelated game, it breaks the immersion and just looks tacky. The game is also filled with party members inspired by the likes of Pewdiepie and Vsauce, I personally don't really care for or follow famous youtubers/twitch streamers so this aspect of the game is kind of lost on me. Others might enjoy that but I prefer the original party members (like Johnnes or Holmey). Not only are the original characters more interesting and genuinely funny but their skills are more dynamic and fun to use.  It's a weird and bizarre game and you should get a few chuckles out of it. I do recommend the game but it's not going to be for everyone and I'm not gonna lie, some of the best RPG maker games out there are actually completely free. But if you really like what Dingaling did with the RPG maker engine then you might have a decent time with PRiCERPG.\\n\", 'Extremely hard but very rewarding game\\n', \"It's a nice expansion. I couldn't test it all but the floods and droughts are nice game elements. However, for my casual play-style and my humble wallet the current game is enough so I'll wait for a sale. Or even wait till Civ VII comes out and buy that.\\n\", \"Not much time on the game, but I don't like it. With this title Kagura seems to be going to the way of the Sakura and Neko Para games, and away from serious H-games. The mechanics of the game remind me of ancient early rpgs from the 1980s, way to outdated to be fun. The positive reviews confuse me, because this is not the kind of game I would want more of. I would like it if Kagura would give us more details on what to expect from the game, because I really wasn't interested in a light hearted tail of harem lust. I don't like playing the fool or having no direction in what happens to my heroes and heroines.\\n\", \"it's kinda hard to properly master the game due to it's difficulty. but overall,it is fun to play and also one of the game that i could play just to kill time. and yea,the harder the better, right?\\n\", \"Excellent game.

Also I love games like Flashback, Another World and The Way, so this game didnt disappoint in any way.\\n', 'Press F to pay respects\\n', \"You know, I usually write joke reviews. But this game dissapointed me more then ever, I bought this thinking I would spend my life playing a rhythm game like Osu, but what I got was a game with not a lot of songs and if you want the true experience you must buy the dlc. I wouldn't mind if the game if it had more songs, but the song choice is pretty poor. The fact I have to pay more then most indie games just to play more songs makes me sad, please. Update your game page or something to say getting the DLC has the true experience, I feel ripped off and I am ashamed of it. 4/10   TL;DR: If you want to play some songs, this game is fine. But if you want a real rhythm game, either buy the DLC with the game in a budle or don't even buy it.\\n\", 'Great Game, Recommend to anyone!\\n', 'A masterpiece , great graphics, fast gameplay, excelent music and sound overall, cant wait for more!\\n', \"The lack of customization is a shame.

The audio was really well done. The build up of suspense and some of the jumpscares have all been honed to near-perfection and it really does work well in this type of game.

Normally with games like Hitman, I am usually all about finding unique ways to take out my targets.  However, the story has a way of dragging you in, and I liked the way season 1 ended.

Needs alot of work. I can't recommend it in its current state.  Edit: seems as though Jacks are worth 2, Queens 3 and Kings 4. Aces are always 11. This is why the scoring is wonky. Not sure why they chose not to use Blackjack's actual rules.\\n\", 'The new dlc adds 5 new dinosaurs with 2 being irl dinosaurs and 3 being hybrids, Troodon, Olorotitan, Spinoraptor, Ankylodocus, and Stegoceratops. It also added new feeders, the advanced storm staition, and tons of new researchables. To get all this you -have- to go through the challenges in the dlc after beating Muerta with 4 stars, and the two new areas of the islands have difficulties all their own. I personally enjoyed the new expansion, as It added more to do in the game, and made my Indominus into the camouflager that it always was ment to be. Looking forward to more expansions, I hope that the next one helps our parks become more beautiful.\\n', \"It’s a great proof on concept. Please don't go in expecting a fully fleshed out and completed game because this is not that. It shows promise if the devs stick by it. The tricks are fun to pull off, similar to Skate except tricks require two sticks. Imo as someone who couldn't get into Skate and was a THPS purist, this is actually an improvement. The grinding semi works and is probably my biggest complaint. If you don’t land EXACTLY on the ledge or rail you fall off your board instantly. The graphics are the best any skating game has had so far, but considering the last game was 2010 that isn't a huge compliment.

The poor graphics (compared to triple A games) make the game even creepier. The game does not include too many jump scares, but when it is featured, it is done right. The combat makes the horror level of this game far more superior compared to other scary games without much combat. You feel under-powered, but you are not hopeless. What I love is that every new game plus is a different experience. Enemy placement is shifted, making the game a lot more fresh. The multiple endings are also great. The only complaints, if any, are that sometimes the DB shotgun's barrels will still be open after loading and the sledgehammer and the knife seem identical, making it pointless to feature it.  9/10\\n\", \"Wow, definitely very scary. The music and visuals are a great tribute to the survival horror classics. The combat is actually not super difficult until the end. For example I didn't even need to precision aim my weapons until the very end of the game. The puzzles aren't mind bending either. But definitely if you want a fun and truly scary experience, this game will deliver for a great price.  P.S. Love the Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem esque tricks.

It\\'s like Devil May Cry, and Titanfall had a baby. For this being a $7.00 demo (I bought it discounted at $4.89) I am really excited to see more from this developer. He is working on this by himself for crying out loud!. The visuals are amazing and the combat is so spot on! I love dodging left and right then jumping into the air while gunning down enemies while slashing them with the light sword it just felt so badass. The game is quite difficult to any players who aren\\'t used to fast paced shooters, I died six times on my first playthrough but still had a blast running through the demo. The story seems intriguing with it\\'s environmental story telling but I feel like the main character talks a little too much to the point where it does feel a little annoying. Dialogue in a video game with fast paced combat is very distracting (especially when it is in a language that I don\\'t understand) and can ruin the experience so my only recommendation is make the characters talk when the combat is not way too intense so the Player is not distracted from the main focus of the game (being combat), like for example give the game a \"DOOM treatment\" where the character you play as is silent during combat but can freely speak through cutscenes and during exploration when combat isn\\'t present.

By the end of the day, your military is back up to about half it\\'s prior numbers, a quarter of it\\'s prior strength (because the game gave you nothing but woodcutters, miners and people with a 20% movement debuff) and you\\'re almost entirely out of wood and iron to recruit more. Sun goes down, zombies come out, you get steamrolled. Game over. And this is on easy mode, because the bosses are deliberately designed to destroy your population numbers and make you struggle to get back to where you were. On a high difficulty setting, fine, but when the 1st boss wipes your entire military of 25-30 tier 2 spearmen, healers and arbalists with massively OP AOE attacks and then trickles in garbage villagers to replace them with, on EASY mode? No, I\\'m calling BS on that.  There\\'s a lot of RNG involved here, both in what type of new villagers you roll and resource placement on the map. The RNG is pretty poor for both. You might end up with a village full of miners and three or four that are useful for combat, or none at all. Farmers are nearly nonexistent, while villagers with a 20% movement debuff are as common as stink on shit. They\\'re about as useful, too, at least until what\\'s-his-face comes around looking for sacrifices. They have a use then and you\\'ll very much enjoy sending them to their deaths. Regarding the resources, you may get resources everywhere or you might get no more than ten trees on the ENTIRE map, most of which will be way away from your base, and practically no iron and/or gold, basically making the map unplayable.  There\\'s also way too much micromanagement going on and on the most basic and tedious levels. For example, you can mine into the ground but you have to direct your miners to go up and down ladders. You can\\'t have a miner on the surface, pick him, and then rt click on a rock underground. Nope, you have to send him down the ladder into the mine, then down another ladder to where the rock is, then rt click the rock. Every. single. fakkin. time. And that\\'s just for miners. You may need to send others down there, too, and it works the same way. This is no fun whatsoever when you have an extensive underground mine system and tons of people down there working. They\\'re constantly depleting a resource node and need to be A. found amongst the other 30 or so miners and B. moved. This is on top of microing umpteen surface villagers.  Then there\\'s just trying to select those villagers. THEY ARE TINY and very hard to click on, especially when moving or if you\\'re in a hurry. Selecting groups moves them in tight packs, making it even harder to selct a single one later. It also makes potions rather silly. As far as I have seen, they only work on individual villagers. Try giving one to a single spearman or archer that\\'s jammed up against several more. It\\'s almost impossible. Potions should have an AOE effect on everybody in range and just do away with this headache.  Last but not least, the game simply looks dull. Nearly everything is either green or brown, in varying shades of drab. Why are there no flowerbeds in front of houses, at least tier 3 houses, or planter boxes? The tavern, too. There\\'s nothing, unless you want to spend 5 gold to put sheep or chickens on the roof. That\\'s right, on the roof of the house! I was really sort of stunned when I realized this and thought to myself \"This just can\\'t be. Surely, there\\'s some color at higher village levels?!\" so I checked the screenshots. I saw something that looked like green and red torches, and that\\'s it.  Still, given it\\'s price, it\\'s hard to not recommend this game, and I\\'m sure the guy worked hard on it, but I\\'m going to not recommend it anyway. Why? Because, really, it\\'s just not much fun and price is a nonfactor. Objective quality is not judged by it\\'s cost but by well-designed and intuitive mechanics and overall fun factor, regardless of the cost. This game doesn\\'t have it, not for $0.50 and not for $50.   I do see that a lot of people like it. That\\'s fine. I probably like a lot of games they despise. That\\'s just the way it goes. If you think the game looks fun and don\\'t care about any of this, pick it up. Hell, it\\'s just $3! I\\'m not going to recommend it, though, for the simple fact that I don\\'t think it\\'s a good game.\\n', \"Very fun and challenging game, rarely left me feeling towards the game's fault in any hits taken! Considering the quality of the game's graphics, music, gameplay, and game time, Well worth its money and maybe even more.

I think it is an addictive puzzle game.\\n', 'There are two aspects to this game. Cards, and porn. Somehow, it fails at both.  The main game play is, in short, a slog. Round time is bogged down by uneccessarily long animations with absolutely no options for speeding up play, which we\\'ll get more into a bit later. The game featured is Blackjack, which should be really simple. But the game asigns arbitrary values to face cards that completely ignore modern rules. Besides this, the game will miscount cards frequently. Additionally, a serious case of \"The Computer is a cheating bastard!\".  Even following a safe bet on 16, hold on 17, the CPU will get a card that they need, usually to get them to 20/21, a vast majority of the time. I have serious doubts about the game being random.  The slow and frustrating pace of game play does little to help the overlying problem of price, value, and what you receive. For every game you win, you get one coin. If you lose, you get no coins. There is absolutely no way to increase how many coins you get per win, or at all. You win, and you get your coin, and that\\'s it. In the shop, a couple of characters cost 10 coins, a majority cost 25, and a couple of items are 50. It took me well over 100 games with this bullshit system to farm out for the very first character that actually shows you what you bought the game for, 10 coins. 100+ games. You could do the math, but I\\'ll just tell you the answer. It\\'s not fun. That\\'s the answer.  Oh, you didn\\'t know? That\\'s right. Despite being a pornographic game that you must PAY FOR, Blackjack of strip will make you jump through hoops to see stripping of any kind. The first two characters you start with have absolutely zero featured nudity. Those characters will act like bashful teenagers and cover everything in a blushing blaze. To see anything worth seeing, you have to buy one of the 10 coin characters. Remember, it\\'s only about 100 games. The real grind is for the deck of \"naked\" girls, who, yes, every single one, wears underwear.  And all of this could possibly be forgivable if the developers gave any care to their game or their customers, but they do not. Despite suggestions outstanding for a year, there has been zero changes to the game. Whatever interest in this game I had died long ago with an inactive, uncaring team.

It dosen\\'t try to pull an Atlas where the devs did the bare minimum to get it onto the store through Early Access, instead the\\'re using Early Access for what it\\'s meant for, a way for developers ot showcase their game while it\\'s in development, not as a glorified beta test.

Love sci-fi but I normally I have trouble playing space and flying games because of the disorientation from flying in three dimensions. Usually I play games with my feet on the ground.  In Astrox you can successfully fly your ship from a tactical view (space bar to activate) that allows you to choose the weapon(s) and the target without having to take the cockpit view and fly it yourself. Of course for you pilots out there you can still do that if you want.  Combat is busy. You can hire up to 10 mercs to fly with you and you will certainly encounter enemy fleets of 10 or more at a time.  It may be early access but the devs get bug fixes out in a day or two or even same day. Not a singe game breaking problem in the 20+ hours I have played. Some features are not fully implemented yet but there is still lots to do in the game.  Tons of skills and missions for you RPGers out there. You can specialize in mining, scanning, trading, delivery, enforcing the law or pirating. Within combat there are lasers (no ammo but uses a lot of energy) or beam, projectile, missile and torpedo weapons that all use ammo of different types and different prices.   Your skill points are somewhat limited so you need to have a long term plan. There are enough skill points available to try various play styles without totally gimping your character.  One nice feature is you can adjust game speed, death penalty, space harshness and resource respawn rates at any time.  You can't fly around in space forever. You will need to stop at starbases occasionally to restore your energy and life support. Better gear and skill extends your life support. If you are mining in a remote system you may be limited by your cargo hold or your life support or pirates.  My current low to mid tier ship has 5 weapon slots, 5 passive slots and 4 life support slots. I could use a slot to allow me to deploy droids of a few different types.  Maybe I will buy a carrier ship next that has droid slots built in. Ships are also modable so expect to see some unusual ships in the future.

Long review: I setup my g920 in like 2 min, everything was smooth and straight forward , the graphic is somewhat good, not amazing ofc, the SUV physics sucks actually and didn’t enjoy driving it at all, the bus physics on the other hand is amazing and felt real to me. The AI sucks, when passengers boarding, when passengers leaving, its all need work, also, AI cars do a lot of stupid things, and will not interact with turning signals. The sounds need a lot of improvements also, its felt primitive and rushed, also crash sounds totally inaccurate! Gameplay, this is where this game shine, everything organized, simple yet feels right, I like all the non-driving aspects of the game, and yet a lot for me to discover.

Ultra Off-Road Simulator 2019: Alaska lets you drive in the snow and other weather, which is something sorely lacking in MudRunner. This really had the potential to capture an entire fan base.  If the devs can't be bothered to include driving controls that have been standard for the last decade and a half, what's the point in making a driving focused game? Sure you can play with a keyboard and mouse, but for a game that requires precision driving to omit proper analogue support is a disgrace.

Solid artwork, smooth animation, and the combat requires skill (at this point I haven't even gotten near the end of level one).  My only caveat is a issue with the sound, it works 95% of the time, but it seems to stretch out at some points (on digital media, stretched out sound is pretty disruptive).\\n\", 'So, I know my record says I\\'ve played ARK for 302 hours (give or take), but that\\'s only on this one computer. Realistically I\\'ve probably played around 600+ hours, which is more than any other game I own on steam COMBINED.  ARK is wonderful. If you ever watched Jurassic Park, or grew up reading dinosaur books, playing the classic Carnivores games or dreaming of discovering the \"lost\" giant reptiles of the unexplored corners of the modern world: this game is for you. Or, if you love open-world building, progressive, dinosaur hunting exploration games, get this. You\\'ll need a computer with pretty good specs, but if you have one, it\\'s a blast.  Yes, it takes a bit of a beefy computer to run smoothly. I own an Inspiron gaming laptop with 16 GB of ram and a 4GB graphics card. On it I can run ARK at almost perfect specs with 30-40 fps. On perfect specs, this game looks fanTAStic, and the devs continue to put out new updates regularly that (most of the time) improve the game and/or general smoothness. This is not a dead game by any means, and the people who work on this game really seem to care about making it better.  Cons, there are still quite a few bugs, although with cheats you can practically undo any single-player mistake you might make if you\\'re willing to spend a bit of time on it. Farming can be quite the hassle as well until you have tamed dinosaurs specifically suited for harvesting materials. I\\'ve never played for extended amount of time on multiplayer servers because most of the ones I find have a TON of people on them, who will grief your items when you log off and destroy your base. However, it\\'s practically impossible to \"beat\" ARK\\'s two newest DLCs alone, so multiplayer servers featuring those expansions are necessary. It can also be very frustrating. There will be moments where you find yourself trapped between a Giganotosaurus and two Alpha Rexes, and all you\\'ve got is a bow and arrow and way too many resources in your inventory to run. So long as you don\\'t let that discourage you, you\\'ll continue to progress.  Pros, the basic Island map, however, is enough to give the single player hours upon hours (days, even) of enjoyable exploration, farming, hunting and building. Dinosaurs are frequent, many of which are passive and allow for a smooth progression up the crafting ladder. Materials are easy to find in their biome, gameplay is smooth, graphics are very impressive for such a massive open-world game, and honestly  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE.

The controls are good, the pixel art and animations are excellent, the music is great and a lot of thought went into the level design.  While the basic controls might seem simplistic, there are a few \"special\" moves that you can perform. Holding Down and pressing Attack while in the air in particular will make you do a spin attack that lets you bounce off of monster girls\\' heads and makes some platforming sections much easier.  I personally like playing on Hard, but there are four different difficulty levels and even the platforming will be easier at lower difficulty; the lower the difficulty, the more blocks there are to jump on and the more spikes are replaced by blocks and such.  I already owned the game (twice, in fact), but I feel like this sort of talent and dedication deserves encouragement. While I\\'m typically wary of early access, I already pre-ordered Kyrieru\\'s next big game (for multiple times its selling price) and I\\'m feeling good about it.  tl;dr Eroico is a very short but very cute and extremely well-made game.

They do need to finish off some bits, such as the fact that outside fences that are completely in the way and come with the houses, you can't actually demolish, and the fact some of the weeds you can't see properly so when taking jobs you're stuck on very close to full completion.   For me, at this stage it's a positive review, I like the direction this game is going and the steady stream of updates that we're receiving.\\n\", 'TFW a 1,000 year flood wipes out your city and you dam up the river, but you cant dam it up because your city is a glorified swimming pool.\\n', 'Just play Minecraft\\n', \"Let's be clear from the get go. This is NOT a game. This is a protoype trying to evolve on the  Skate formula. If you see the price tag as an investement toward building a new Skate game with new control schemes and you are a skater or trully enjoy skateboard games, i can recommend it. But if you expect a certain amount of content as any early access game should have, you'll be disappointed.  The first aparrent thing that comes to mind is the different control scheme. It is still heavily grounded into the physics based gameplay Skate got us used to, but with a difference. Each joystick controls each foots independantly. You have to unlearn your old habits from Skate 3 but after an hour or two, you start understanding the subtlelty of it. By positionning your foots independantly, you can manage the way you balance your weight on the board. Which means that you can even choose the way you press a crooked grind on the ledge for example. It still needs a bit of work but the base controls are promising.   It isn't perfect tho. The total lack of vert mean that we still can't grab and no 540 over the ramp. Grinding can still feel a bit off, like if your trucks were made of soap. Manual are a bit stiffed too and doesn't translate well the search of balance a manual would impose There are also isolated but still problematic issues with certain controllers, especially PS4's with dead-zone triggering unwanted shove it while arming an ollie. Also no walk mode.  Let's talk about the map. This is where the game gets a giant no-no from me. It is ridiculously small, and i mean like half the size of the first Skate 1 demo! Any skateboard games lives and die on its level design. Skater XL in their quest to realism decided to recreate real places up to scale. Great idea on paper, terrible in practice. Gameplay should always come first, and a map designed around your control scheme to chain tricks and land them is always going to be better than scaling a street primarily designed for pedestrians. I don't care if those lamp posts exists in real life, the only thing i'm thinking with the controller in hand is that they are in the way. i don't care if those red benches are set up this way in real life, they feel to close to each other so it's a pain to naturally chain tricks. Don't expect any kind of point system or goals to reach, there are none.  In term of visuals, I strongly believe that you can still have personnality while retaining the realism that you aim for. And right now the game has this mobile phone realism looks. Skybox is bland, lighting is bland, textures are bland, COD color palet type...bland. I don't know, it's not badly made in itself, but it just doesn't breathe life to me.   Sound design is fonctionnal.  And now the price tag. Far too costly to my liking but it depends on you really. If you see the 20$ price as an investement toward building a new game, the way a kickstarter works than YES i recommend it. There is a very solid chunk of gameplay here that could poitentially translate into a well made game.  But if you would treat this product as any 20$ early access game, this is clearly not enough. Especially if you compare it to the Skate 1 demo 10 years ago which was free at the time and offered a bigger and better map, had a complete trick system and score system, and overall, was just a better product. For free. Than NO i wouldn't recommend it.   With all that said, I only wish that Easy Day Studio prove me wrong on this one and improve on every thing i said, i'd gladly change my review back (i already did thanks to this nice dude in my comment section). I crave for a new skate game, but right now Skater XL as it is, can't be worth a recommandation from me. Wait and see.\\n\", 'When Dark Elf was first released despite its horrid translations, bugs and gameplay I gave it a treatment similar to that of a mother to her youngest autistic daughter. Despite how many times she bit my hand or smear poop on the walls I still praised her for not drinking the laundry detergent. Now, the reason for my support has manifested as good eroge has begun to enter steam.  From that first paragraph I am sure you can already tell how I feel about this game. If you\\'re as dense as god damned Jupiter, I would let this game do me just as every heroine in this game lets the MC do them. In layman\\'s term, it\\'s at the very least 1000/10.  What? A mere number isn\\'t enough for you? You want a thorough review? Aren\\'t we entitled now. But if you want a girl hentai artist\\'s perspective fine, I\\'ll give it to you. But you better be over 18 because I\\'ll be sucking this game\\'s chinchin until my jaw drops. So without further delay let\\'s start!  Evenicle is an eroge made by Alicesoft. What\\'s Alicesoft you ask? Just the company that brought to us Sengoku Rance! If you don\\'t know what Sengoku Rance is then please leave this page before I stain your innocent little minds! If that\\'s not enough to get your attention the guy who designed the characters in this game are all by Takashi Torii! \"Who\\'s Takashi Torii?\"- says some random idiot. Listen you uncultured swine, Takashi Torii is the character designer of Senran Kagura! Senran god damned Kagura! The tandem of these two entities make for an amazing one- two thrust which will surely knock you up I- I mean knock off... your feet.  The artstyle is godly, as expected of the man who brought us Senran Kagura. Everyone including the worthless NPCs look beautiful and those who matter look even better! This translates magnificently to the CGs that are all just breathtaking! Best of all, this game has the balls to make sure that everything is UNCENSORED! Because of this, while this work is certainly not the best game to stream, it is certainly the best in making you gush a stream. Whether you\\'re man, woman, trap or reverse trap you will appreciate the amazing details in every art work that transcends our mortal plane!  Gameplay is not only decent, but it\\'s fun and engaging! While it pales in comparison to games that really focus more on gameplay it\\'s waaayyyyy ahead of everything else that\\'s on this genre. The overworld looks great and the artwork during battle are also all decent! Furthermore, if you manage to catch \"gal monsters\", you are rewarded magnificent CGs that are simply fabulous. The difficulty of the enemies are also very challenging! It draws you in by giving you fodder then gradually increases the difficulty until you realize you\\'re being molested by a girl holding a pencil, watch out because she\\'ll shove the business end of that pencil so far up your filthy hole you will be drawing with your lips.  Plot is incredibly entertaining. Going into this game I had no expectations for its story but after playing through it I can say that it managed to immerse me in. You\\'re some bloke who can\\'t control his chinchin and always wants to shove it inside women\\'s chitsus, kinda like in real life. You can\\'t do that because if you do, the laws of the world will punish you and label you an outlaw, which is a punishment only equalled by death. The only way you can then do this is by becoming a knight which will give you the privilege to marry someone. How many wives you\\'re allowed to have is dependent on your rank as a knight. Because you\\'re an uncontrollable pervert you\\'ve made it your sworn duty to reach the rank of Zero (the highest rank) to be able to get as many wives as you can (10 but who\\'s counting?). In the middle of doing that you get caught up in the affairs of the kingdom and soon find yourself fighting not only for the oppais and denbus but also for the fate of the world! This game surprised me with its many twists which still has me asking for more.  Soundtrack is amazing! Each place you go to has a different score which fits the area. Not much really to say here. While it\\'s not the best there is, the soundtrack for this game is nothing short of awesome.  Translations do not only work but are the best! None of those machine translations taht sometimes show you moonrunes. It\\'s clear that the studio did not cheap in and really hired a professional to do the translations!  Voice Acting... oh god the voice acting. As a girl I am used to the sound of women\\'s lewd moans. After all, if I ever want to hear some I only have open my shameless mouth... to the shame of my parents. Despite that however the voice acting in this game made me blush... and maybe even a little drippy.  Characters are all freaking awesome. There\\'s not a single character who\\'s \"generic\". They\\'re all unique from each other and they all have their quirks. There\\'s the dumb cool one, the bright cute one, the dumb cute one, the socially inept cute bright one, and many more! All the characters in your party have their backstories and they\\'re all explored and fleshed out! Then all the wives that are not in your party are all stellar! And most importantly ERIMO IS BEST GIRL!  Overall no matter how much I dislocate my jaw in sucking this game\\'s chinchin I will still not be able to fit its massive girth. It\\'s difficult to swallow... that an eroge like this can take all my time while there are \"triple A\" games in front of me just waiting to be played. This game is one of the best, if not the best, eroge I\\'ve played on steam. It was so good that I bought 2 more for my friends. In summary, if you\\'re a fan of Japanese eroge, then Evenicle is a must buy. If you\\'re new to the genre, it\\'s a game that will gently welcome you into the genre. If you\\'re not a fan of newds and lewds then stay away... why are you even on this page reading this review?! So, for fans, please consider buying this and not pirate it! The artist drew his heart out and in my honest opinion deserve every penny.  \"Dunno if it\\'s \\'cause I just came, but it feels better than when we started\"- Erimo\\n', \"Finally I can uninstall this game now it's all done and finished.

You chop down trees (or the like) from left or right avoiding branches - that's it (and probably pretty much how it works in real life - life lesson learned).  Pro: Core idea is the same as classic Timberman - which is its recipe for succes imho. Soundtrack is great. The new game modes mix things up nicely - keeps you engaged for longer. And it's dirt cheap.  Con: Online play at the moment seems to be very much dead - due to very few people playing, I guess. So get onboard!   At first I was really bothered that at game over you have to wait through fadeout & game over screen for 1-2 seconds (which feels long in such a hectic game and in the original was skippable by button press) before getting back to chopping (seemed to really interupt the built up excitement) but I got over it.\\n\", 'It is a very good vr shooter.

I'd write more but...Ima play another game or two.\\n\", 'nice\\n', 'this game copied undertale\\n', '[h1] Lost in Translation [/h1]  Lost in Vivo is a tech demo at best; it is a proof of concept. A non-existant story, shoddy gunplay against twitchy enemies that are hard to hit, and bizarre glitches (and I am not even talking about the intentional ones that break the fourth wall) all serve to ruin a superbly crafted atmosphere, and ultimately the game itself.  Lost in Vivo tells the story of... someone, doing... something. Ostensibly you play as someone with claustrophobia, but that is never made clear in-game given your character dives right into a tight sewer to save a guide dog that I assume he is not too acquainted with. The game\\'s events could just as easily be a fever dream, so if the developer does not care about his story then neither will I. Along the way you will aquire weapons with poor hit detection to fight spastic, annoyingly loud monsters which exist because why not, you will collect \\'lost tapes\\' that do nothing and serve no purpose, and on a single occasion you will be guided by an angel who seems to take an interest in you/your dog because... just because! It is worth noting that Akuma Kira claimed to be inspired by \"Dante\\'s Inferno\"- now whether Kira is talking about the 2010 video game, or the Divine Comedy is anybody\\'s guess, because both of those clearly have no weight on the plot beyond a piece of graffiti that says \\'abandon all hope, ye who enter here\\' and I am paraphrasing said graffiti with the correct text because I do not even think it accurately quotes the source material.  Akuma Kira is a talented artist with a vivid imagination, but a questionable writer who lacks the skill to manifest his vision. Unless the final product is his vision, in which case Kira is a hack. Kira could get away with plotholes, ambiguities and nonsensical story elements in Spooky\\'s House of Jumpscares because that game is a gimmick and the plot is an excuse. That approach will not work with an atmospheric horror game: something which Lost in Vivo claims to be.  Kira\\'s sheer artistic talent alone is the only reason I will not crap on this game in its entirety, but it is not enough to convince me that money should be spent on a tech demo.\\n', \"Very fun game.   I mostly wanted to write this for people who were looking for a comparison of this game VS Onward. I noticed a lot of Non recommends because people were saying it was too casual for people who enjoyed Onward, or that Onward was too difficult and this game is easier etc.  Onward is a Military Simulator type shooter, with focus on squad dynamics and communication and teamwork. It is not easy by any means, and it only get crazier as you go. Think of it as Rainbow Six Vegas as far as pacing goes, or even ARMA if you choose to play it that way.  Contractors has more of a Call of Duty Black Ops 2 feel to it. The gunplay is pretty decent, but the game suffers from the same issues as COD does. People flying around corners and snapshotting you with a sniper rifle with a red dot, effectively one hitting you. There is a very toxic mentality that seems pretty common, but there is also a decent community looking to just enjoy the game. Contractors has some gorgeous graphics, but it suffers from the distance fuzz that all VR games suffer from. The motion controls are great, with the only personal exception being that your chest rig is too far out from your actual body, and it makes for confusing use of magazines, and tactical options like grenades. Personally I like to have my stuff fit a bit closer to my body, but I also am fairly slim.  Overall the game is fun. It doesn't play the same as Onward so you shouldn't compare them really, with the exception being that they are both shooters ;)\\n\", 'Very nice but short Game.  Really enjoyed the whole 45 Minutes of Playtime lmao, Guns and the movement felt good.  Only thing that would make the movement nicer would be a slide function (when u croush and sprint)  I hope Episode 2 coming out the next months. All in all the Game is good and brings you 30 - 60 Minutes of Fun.  But also i have to say that episode 2 should be included in the future and hope it dont costs additinal money, cause 5 € for about 45 Minutes of playtime is still not worth it.\\n', 'I understand why people in vr are playing with locked rooms.\\n', \"'Bonds' is a visual novel from DiD games, the creatores of the free rpgmaker game 'DiDnapper' and are currently working (at the time of writing) on a sequel to that game. The novel stars two friends, Robin and Alicia, in college. Having been friends since childhood, Robin feels its finally time to tell Alicia her biggest secret: she likes being tied up, and hopes her best friend will at least not think she's a big wierdo.   What follows is the story of how Alicia reacts to that news and how it shapes their friendship. In short: Alicia is not only fine with it, she actually offers to tie Robin up, and the pair even decide that hey, people on the internet pay money for pictures like this, so why not try it? Thus the game is split between two modes: story mode and session mode, which represents the girls selling commisioned photos of themselves as they keep up in school. As they make more money you can buy more clothes and gear to use, thus allowing you to accept more expansive and lucrative commisions. Its a nice ittle gameplay loop and the amount of stuff available in Session mode justifies the fact that the story itself only takes a little over an hour to actually read.  Whether you like bondage or not, I can say that just about anyone should at least find the story very sweet, and its a nice pick-me-up kind of visual novel. While it isn't very long, there are two endings based on the choices you make, and the writing and high quality artwork for the cutscenes and Session mode justify it in my eyes, especialy since it was made by a team of about three people.   All in all Bonds is a short but sweet little story that should please anyone who likes a little heartfelt romance with likable characters and/or people who find themselves agreeing with Robin that hey, bondage 'is' pretty fun.\\n\", 'fsdfsdf\\n', 'Better than recent AAA games\\n', 'pvp servers suck\\n', 'Canada.

The story was cliched and could be seen a mile away from even the most casual VN consumer . The character design was cute and inoffensive. The censorship is in my opinion overboard. If you're buying this to get your rocks off, they did a horrible job with the mosaics. Took me around ~5 hours to finish it and that was including the time I mess around with other computer junk. The translation is also iffy in some places (the spelling in particular) but it clearly conveys what needs to be said.

This game is beautiful, but with the new updates it doesnt feel like the old dinosaur game anymore. And once you have a stone base with a smithy it will become a boring grinding game; yes you can tame super strong dinosaurs but why? to kill a boss. Seems fun untill you realise it is either you kill the boss easily or you lost all your dino's. After about 450 hours of gameplay i can say the first stage of the game, building your first stone house that functions good is the most fun.   If you have friends go and play on single player or pve (singleplayer can be played with friends and has better fps). Why not pvp? well because there are people that spawn in singleplayer cheated stuff (which is possible in official servers) to raid your base. The fps is also a big issue. I have a laptop bought in 2015-2016 for 1000 euros which is able to run it on low-medium at only 30-50 fps depending on how bug the base is. One time me and my friend made a gigantic base, but i wasnt able to work on there anymore as the fps would drop to 20 when i got in render distance.  So my tip is here: Dont search anything up on internet or any other search platform, both you and your friend. Play with gathering on 1 and taming on 3, and enjoy your first adventures, which this game has. Also use S+ mod to be able to pick up buildings without losing stuff.  After all the bad things i said earlier i do have to admit that there are still a lot of things that makes me love this game. If the game gets better fps it could really become one of the best if not the best survival game.  Dont buy this game for the full price, wait for the sales which are common, you will save more than 50%. I hope i helped you, please think this game through before you buy it. - Do you have friends which you can play it with (as it is boring solo) - Is my pc good enough - Am i willing to go through a lot of stressful moments when your dinos may die or when you lose all your stuff. - Mods which automattically shut down so you lose all your buildings/items from that mod*   *Also if you happen to be the host of your world, ALWAYS check if the mods are active when you start, sometimes they get a auto update and go out of the active mods list, with no warming messages.\\n\", 'This is much fun!\\n', 'Look up meshing and why you should not play this game because of it...

It definitely has some flaws, and by flaws I mean:  -poor meshing  -unstable servers -\"box tribes\" that refuse to follow ToS (mostly any other letter character that is not in your language or internationally used shows up as a [], mostly Chinese) -\"pilllaring\" and unnecessary land claims -Random deaths while offline and protected (usually after patches/server crashes. always log off with your body empty) -Lots of bullshit moments such as random dc while flying/fighting, or a giga decides to say hi to your new home.  -Troodons, fuck those little bastards -if raising babies, sometimes they don\\'t register that they have an entire trough of food next to them and starve  There is definitely a lot of flaws, but there are good things too:  -definitely addicting. getting that first base built or taming your first animal feels big. eventually you\\'ll feel the need to tame every damn dodo you see ;) -Interacting with others. Almost everyone has the same goals in mind. Helping or being helped goes a long way in getting trust and making friends. Don\\'t be the loner who never talks, talking to people, offering to help, getting to know everyone on server and being active makes your chances of being accepted into a tribe or just by the server itself really easy. (New people ppleaseeee don\\'t get angry if nobody will let you join their tribe with your fresh new character. Inside jobs are common. make a home and prove you can be somewhat self sufficient first. someone will most likely take notice and invite you :) ) -The maps are awesome. whichever map you chose definitely gives a challenge. Personal favorite is Ragnarok, but it can get laggy. -Commitment. This game is not for someone looking for a few minutes to waste time before work. Before you know it, you\\'ll have grown a beard and wondered where your life has went. playing for 3 minutes could turn into 3 hours easily. IF youre looking for a long term game and have a lot of time to play, this is the game for you. -Server transfers. if you join a server and everyone is being an absolute dick to you, or there is no space to build, then you can transfer your character and dinos to another server that is the same game mode (PVE=PVE)(PVP=PVP)(PVE ≠ PVP). keep to official tho, you cannot transfer to unofficial or to legacy, vice versa. you will have to start over if you switch to a different server layout. -Tribes. To have the best time of your life, get yourself a tribe of weirdos. The more misfits, the merrier. Want to troll a fellow comrade? Tranq arrow his ass, throw his body into a pin-coded cage, and either whip or torture him to your hearts content. Have an offline buddy who owns a big base? drag him and let him log into random areas to confuse him when he gets on. Better yet, if you\\'re allied with your neighbors, why not just drag and drop him there? He\\'ll log on and wonder how the hell he ended up in your ally\\'s pig pen. And yes, they do shit a lot.  For the most part, its a wonderful community. I have had a few problems here and there with other tribes, but the overall game has been awesome. Id recommend to anyone who just wants to mess around and have a little fun with friends while watching your tribe mate get mauled by a raptor or two. \\n', \"Simple  and clean platformer with a large variety of increasingly demanding puzzles and trials. Quick to pick up and play. Easy to learn, but difficult to master. You have complete air control and high friction which might take a bit of getting used to, but lends to the high speed of the puzzles once you get the hang of it.  Rapid restart and death cycles so you're not spending a lot of time waiting as you're crunching through trying to shave off just a few more miliseconds.

I enjoyed the idea of the game, the game play is there, but the bugs wear you down.  I\\'ve been playing this game off and on since it launched in early access, coming back every few months or more to see if they\\'ve fixed the bugs that keep pushing me away.  They\\'ve added more and more content to round out the game sure, but bug fixing has always been something the devs seemed to tackle halfheartedly, always in favor of new mechanics, higher tech ladders, and more DLC maps (as was seen when they pushed DLC while still in Early Access).  Which don\\'t get me wrong, is awesome, but they desperately needed to focus a lot more attention to fixing these crash bugs that most just consider \"the norm\" at this point.  Finding a server that fits you is a very tedious endeavor.  Playing solo is very rough and not very rewarding, the constant crashes making you lose progress are infuriating (game intermittently saves itself, but when out doing stuff in the wild and riding dinos it won\\'t).  The game is just designed to play over long periods of time with other players filling out the daily cycle of tribe chores.  It\\'s a lot of fun when you find a good server to play on, but they tend to flame out as they become over built or under manned, and OFFICIAL servers are cesspools of spawn denial camps/traps to even try to get started on now.  More than anything this game was poorly coded at it\\'s core, MANY players give up playing just due to not being able to find any way to deal with the crash bugs and the devs have never seemed to make much of a priority on fixing bugs, they just keep adding new DLC maps (or reskinning it and selling it as a new game, *cough* ATLAS)\\n', 'Most stupid and most enjoyable 12 minutes of my life.\\n', 'gohans ssj2 transformation scene vs cell aligns perfect with the music\\n', 'Fun and worth the price!

Cons:  - It feels as if you're skating through sand, after one trick you'll find yourself pushing again. - There's one tiny stock map, the modding community provides a ton more, but they are mixed in terms of quality. - Trick access feels limited. Basically it's all kickflip, and heelflip variations, but nothing past that point. - Grinds and slides are awkward at best. Most of the time you'll find yourself magically locking onto a ledge when you're trucks are no where near the edge   Pros:  - Modding community has a TON of free additional content - Tricks are somewhat realistic and very satisfying. - The one foot catch is a nice addition, even if it's a bit buggy.\\n\", 'Must have for fans.\\n', \"How fucking dare you ban a player for pointing out that your game is shit.

The lack of camera control is a nightmare at times, especially when I try to land on another platform. I also keep getting spawned in the same places so I haven't been able to unlock some of the brushes and swatches. Not a huge deal, but I want to make art with more than 4 colors!   That being said, I recommend this game almost entirely based on its charm alone. It's a great little experience that is equal parts surreal and relaxing.

Lakes, Trees, Rain and Open Domes are all achievable now and all you need is a lot of global warming, excessive seed dispersion and nuking the polar ice caps!

Here's why:  -PVP and PVE are so completely different it feels like 2 different games -Solid graphics make the vistas rather stunning and the experience more fulfilling -Riding dinos is rad, but there are several aspects that really make the game rich such as the taming, feeding, and utility -Variety is superior to other games, the 100+ different animals create a vibrant world, but the game design is very well done as each animal has a unique ability or trait that fulfills a specific role within the experience -RPG elements for leveling your character creates a fun personal character, even though the visual differences are primarily created by the gear you carry -An extensive crafting system without fluff, each piece has a purpose and usually multiple ways to use it. It may not be realistic to use a pick on a tree to get more thatch, or a hatchet on a rock to get more stone, but it is intelligently designed to make all things useful, and useful throughout your survival -Discovery and exploration makes this game incredible, as there are creatures to find, artifacts to discover, and a MASSIVE map to explore -Personal servers are easy to start and maintain, allowing you to change maps, save maps, and just experiment if you like -Incredible modding community, which makes sense since you can do SO much with this game -Even though it lacks a Quest system and a human NPC AI system (though these appear to be a part of ATLAS) I wouldn't doubt they may be introduced in the future if not already in a MOD -Air, land, and sea, there are so many ways to enjoy the maps, changing the experience considerably -With a private server you can hop on for 15 minutes to play since you can turn up the XP gain, harvest rate, and tame rate to make the gameplay sharp and fast. Or you can enjoy the long game and celebrate the first time you get a pike -Construction is fantastic, and even though there are moments you get frustrated because of a no-build zone or the snap points aren't behaving, the freedom permitted is better than anything.

I have an updated PC with a newer graphics card that I installed myself recently, and have played many other more resource intensive games with no issues. I would win a fight, and the game would crash. I would restart, and I would lose some of the items I had purchased in my gym for no reason.   I gave the game many chances. I changed to the windowed version, I changed the screen resolution, I changed the graphics quality, and I restarted my PC again. All to no avail.

My biggest gripe is that the ranking seems much too lenient. This of course may be by design and might be nice for beginers, but i feel when you go into the harder songs it becomes hard to gauge if you are simply doing well, or if you are just slaming buttons. The good news is that you can simply go by score and they have something along the lines of a sync rate which seems to be a good way of gauging your proformance.   The other issue isn't, by and large, a big deal. But I feel i should at least point it out for potential buyer. Some of the designs of the stages are incredibly distracting. Specifically the two retro sounding levels. These stages are super cute, adorable, flashy, with beautiful presentation, but it made it much harder for me to focus. The good news which again off kilters this issue is that you can change the theme of the stage before starting the song, so really this issue is moot, but might be somthing worth mentioning.   These are the only issues with this game, as they honestly resolve themselves decently enough. The upside to this game is that this is an encrebily snappy, fun, and cheap rhythm game.

I can see the potential in this game, and it's more or less what I'm looking for (PVE solo EVE), but right now it needs a lot more work.  In my short play time I ran into multiple bugs. The opening narrative text is rife with grammatical and spelling errors; it isn't game-breaking but it is a poor first impression. The character customization has an index cycling bug with the next and previous option buttons. Once on the station I tried remapping my keys (left handed), and found several mapping bugs in the clunky UI. After I managed to change it somewhat to my liking, I realized that the player ground movement controls are baked in (WASD), which is a show-stopper for me.  For the first 20 minutes of my experience, nearly every system and UI feature I encountered had issues. I wish the developer the best and hope they polish this up because I really want to play it.

Yet I feel compelled to post a positive review for two fundamental reasons. First, I am afraid that this game will be neglected, even though it is already a tactical combat gem. Second, the developer is among the nicest and most responsive I\\'ve encountered, and he deserves the support he needs to work his magic to his full capacity.  Now, please understand what this game is - and it is not. This game is first and foremost a tactical combat game - almost a \"combat simulator,\" as one early reviewer put it. And the game does a brilliant job in this aspect. Among other things, the playable character pool is diverse. There are already playable 15 classes - encompassing four different races (human, elf, Dwarf, and treants) with some races having sub-types. In fact, even male and women differentiation is not cosmetic, but substantive - that is, a male elf greatsword will play rather differently from its female elf counterpart. (So this effectively means there are 30 playable classes.) And the enemy types dwarf the playable characters in diversity and richness. Further, and above all, the combat system is complex and yet intuitive in its \"realistic\" aspect.  This is not to say that the game is without its flaws; it is bound to with any small studio project. But the developer is ultra-responsive to player feedback; and virtually no question or complaint goes unanswered on the forum or on the main game Discord server.\\n', 'Dear DDRJake,  please retire as Lead Game Designer or whatever your Job is called. You are doing it bad! This DLC is a desaster and the balance changes only show how little you actually understand of making a deep strategy game with choices worth thinking about.

Corruption for territories, missionary changes, end game tags, capital movement restrictions, braindead AI worse than in patch 1.13 all show how you want to enforce your playstyle upon everyone playing the game and how little you actually understand and are capable of as game designer.

If you\\'re anything raunchy you\\'re not going to get it here, but I honestly have to say the game still managed to make me feel engaged in the whole tying-someone-up thing through the simple dress-up/tie-up gameplay.  The story is very much a slice of life story with a focus on the emotional aspect of bondage (and the relationship between the central characters). While I would have enjoyed a bit more insight into the lives of the main characters outside their interest in bondage, and the relationship development could have used a bit more buildup and perhaps a bit more description of what happens after the climax of the story, the story overall felt really satifying to read. (Basically I\\'m just asking for more lol.) This tension-free, \"fluffy\" and relationship-driven kind of non-drama is pretty much exactly what I look for in romantic fiction.  When it comes to the tech side I direly want a way to increase the text speed. Reading at my own pace doesn\\'t work when the text moves so darn slow, and clicking twice for every line of text doesn\\'t give as nice a flow of reading as only clicking once. Further, standard Visual Novel features like a text log to keep track of what was previously said, and a way to skip text could really make the game play smoother. These are relatively small problems to me though, and the story that is told really makes up for it engagement-wise.

I've played over 600 hours (here and there as it is not my main game by any means) mostly with friends on a non dedicated host using my own machine (which sucks due to the tether and dinos not wanting to spawn in caves until you've been there and you need a good chunk of memory especially if you consider adding mods and there are WYVERNS EVERYWHERE OH GOD) and have recently gone and gotten a server host for a private server and have had even more of a blast (with less of those darn wyverns).  Still get game crashes here and there and it can get a bit scary if you're in a dangerous spot (so be careful with huge builds since some computers scream in terror) but it's been a fun game overall.  I generally avoid public servers provided on games like these due to trolls, toxicity and my own non interest in pvp.  You can set your own game (single player or non dedicated host for fun with friends) to be pve only & friendly fire off (but you can still cackle while dragging your offline friend's body into a different area and trap them there soooo haha).  There's a lot of choice in changing settings for single-player/non dedicated or if you get your own server to make things easier or harder.

From the graphics to the AI to the overall fast-paced, balls to the wall action, Bright Memory delivers. It feels solid and complete. No stuttering, no game-breaking bugs... It just works. Sure, the sound design is a little lacking, and gunshots lack that bassy oomph, you  still feel like you're owning against the demonic creatures you're up against. Loved the dash feature too.

[/b]  Bright Memory seems to do a lot of things right, but also some wrong. It has a very cool premise that's executed a bit lackluster, although it has a lot of potential for the future.  In general, the game is pretty good. The abilities feel satisfying to use, guns not so much. Level design isn't much to write home about, but it serves it's purpose as corridors that go from arena to arena with the occasional puzzle thrown your way.  However my real problem lies with the games UI and combat:  The UI itself is cluttered and looks kinda janky. We have no idea what the orange circles in the middle of the screen are supposed to be, since they don't seem to serve any purpose and are never explained. Add on the various visual effects that shake and make the UI pulsate and you have a recipe for disaster.  Next, the combat feels incredibly samey, spamming the same couple of abilities (EMP/Time stop, then lightblade) and then dashing around shooting until they come off cooldown. This isn't helped by the fact that almost every enemy (except bossess and flying enemies) are vulnreable to the exact same things, and thus you just do the same thing over and over with the same enemies. The mobility mechanics such as the jump and the dash also feel very inconsistent on tops of this.  While the bosses are cool aesthetically, they consist very much of the same gameplay as regular mooks, and both of the ones currently present also throw a horde of regular enemies at you, which is a big no-no (especially at the second one, which has an incredibly small and restrictive arena with additional environmental hazards).  That, along with how little content it currently has sums up my problems with the game currently, but I'm excited to see what direction the developer is taking in the future.  Also as an additional note, expect a few janky translations here and there. Nothing too bad or noticeable, but if you look for them you can find them.\\n\", \"I liked this game from beginning to end.

From Tony Hawk and Coolboarders back in the day, to the Skate games that were more recent.  The Skate games took the fun of Tony Hawk style games, but made it far more realistic--the controls playing a huge role.  They were intuitive but at the same time more difficult to do tricks.  Skater XL takes that idea/concept to another level--let me explain.  Your left analog controls your left foot and your right analog controls your right foot.  At first this just seems like ok, whatever.  However, in practice it accomplishes something amazing.  I personally skate goofy foot (my left foot at the back of the board).  In real life, skating switch is awkward and more difficult.  The same is true in this game.  Because you get comfortable learning the controls one way, if you attempt something switch, the controls are backwards.  It's such a cool idea.  I feel like I have to learn tricks and practice them.  This game has a TON of potential.  In its current state, expect a demo.  There's a small playable area, but it does have a lot of different spot types, so you can definitely get a lot out of it.  There's a high ledge, plenty of low bench/ledges, a few low flat rails, some short handrails, etc.  Looking forward to this game as it develops.  Current feedback:  Default stance: I skate goofy foot, but currently no option to default that way.  You can press select to reset your character, and if you press it twice, you'll reset from regular foot to goofy, which is nice, but not ideal.  An option to set your default would be very welcome.  Stick sensitivity: Obviously the game is still a work in progress, but if this isn't on the list to look at, I think it could use a revisit.  Not sure if maybe it's just a personal thing, so maybe a settings that allows you to adjust the senitivity, but making the neutral zone where you don't flick maybe a little larger would be nice.  Again, if others think it feels fine, maybe not changing it, but having a setting of sorts would be cool.  Other:  The rest of the feedback would be obvious and is likely to come as the game develops such as new spots and areas, etc.  \\n\", \"Issues with performance.

How it manages to do that with such a limited 4 color palette showcases the developers artistic skills. I did not find the controls to be clunky, they are quite typical of mentioned games, but feel actually more precise and less finicky than most 1990's cinematic platformers. The difficulty level feels just about right, while compared to the classics it is on the easier side. There are a lot of points where to save and replenish health. Some other games in the genre did not have any save points but you instead were given a code for each level. The game is relatively short but it does have plenty of replayability.

Where in Rise and Fall the early game was more fun and the game became stale, Gathering Storm makes the Industrial Era probably one of the most fun eras and the future era a 2nd best.  With disasters, the world congress, railroads, canals, and global warming everything stays interesting.  I\\'d say the biggest and most welcome changes for me are the grievance system and resource system.  With the grievance system, managing AI relationships is much much much better.  I find myself in more alliances and know when to stop in a war.  The resource system in addition to the new map geography create very interesting regional conflicts.  I find myself fighting to get Oil and Coal so I can build troops.  I find myself building tunnels, trains, and canals to get better access to certain parts of the world.  Nothing is more satisfying than when I connect 2 oceans and all my trade routes increase in value.  I really respect that they completely revisited governors in gathering storm.  In Rise and Fall the governors felt really bland and out of sync with themselves.  They moved many promotions around and governors now have a single focus as opposed having many different promotions that didn\\'t fit well together.  Where i used to pick the same governors every game, I honestly use every single different governor in different scenarios. Every governor is actually good and worth choosing.    The final thing I\\'ll say is that I did not expect the AI to get smarter, they got WAY smarter.  I don\\'t consider myself great at CIV. I play more to have fun and play with friends than to beat the AI on harder difficulties.  In Multiplayer we used to put the AI on KING and they\\'d act as buffers and trading partners between us.  They are now very difficult on KING and have actually destroyed me.  They now actually use planes and levy city state troops.  Last game Mansa Musa got tired of my aircraft carriers bombing his coast and he actual stationed fighter jets to defend his coast and shot down my bombers.  When he saw me building tanks he built those anti-tank units.  He didn\\'t just build units, he built corps and armies..  He actually pushed back my invasion of his continent and I ended up retreating losing several ships in his bombardment.  I\\'ve never seen the AI do this.  He wasn\\'t that far ahead in technology either.  This is a huge step up from in the past where the AI was totally unreasonable, at one point they all went theocracy all game, and never built certain units.  I remember a time where I didn\\'t know what \"recruit partisans\" mission was in the base game because the AI never actually built neighborhoods at all to do the mission. Now, they actually give me reasonable trades.  I was shocked last game when my ally actually sold me uranium and oil at a reasonable price for the entire game.  Overall, I love this new expansion, they game now feels much more complete.  I really hope they come out with another expansion.  I\\'ve been playing since Civ 3 when I was 10 years old and this expansion is my favorite.\\n', 'very fun game, some cool tricks for those that like them in other words game mechanic SPOILERS!!! #1 when building you can put a structures where there not allowed if it shows red just move it till you see green then move it back doing this i was able to build way further over the hill using stone walls #2 bunnies are your friends, kill them next to unexplored areas, you can then click to explore the area while standing on dead bunny your guy will start exploring then decided to skin the bunny, but the place will keep exploring without your guy there, you can use this to explore multiple parts of the mine with just one guy. #3 use your knights to bait out attacks and then run away, this will slow down the big guys, and can make the giant orc boss incredibly easy, specialy if you do it from behind #4 get your knights behind the final boss to really put out some good dmg, you have to constantly click the knights to attack but he barely hits them and they dish out great dmg #5 i dont know if this is intended but you can add an unlimited number of chickens to your starting house 5 gold at a time, once you got enough you dont need farms or any other units beside militia and one builder, since you can sell the excess food for gold and buy your other resources with the gold. meaning you should have a 80 man military with 1 builder by the time grim comes.\\n', 'Dec 19th***Review changed to negative until vote kick is added****  I had someone griefing and team killing me on sight yesterday, to the point where he followed me to 3 different servers just to keep griefing me.  To be honest, no vote kick or way to address griefers is a shameful oversight on the devs part. Cancerous people like this ruin games for nice people.  I STILL REALLY LIKE THE GAME, BUT REVIEW WILL STAY NEGATIVE UNTIL VOTEKICK IS ADDED. DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASE UNTIL THEN UNLESS YOURE OK PUTTING UP WITH GRIEFERS.   **********Original Positive Review ************* Ill get to the nitty gritty real fast. There is a winning recipe here, fellas. It scratches that itch for those of us wanting something more realistic/slower than Pavlov, but less so than Onward. Personally, I found Pavlovs TTK too high, where as Onwards was too low, leading to frustrating rounds of \"hoof it for 5 minutes, get shot from somewhere you didn\\'t see, repeat\".   The good shtuff: Good weapon handling Good TTK, not to much, not too little Guns all SOUND amazing. (The sound of that AWP will put the fear of god into ya) Options, options, options! (Loco, snap turning, dominant hand, show body, etc.) The kinematics/animations do so much for gameplay. (Seriously, its amazing how something small as a good running and aiming animation can make the people you\\'re playing against seem like real people, instead of avatars being controlled by people. I didn\\'t know I was missing this from other games til I saw it here.) Good weapon variety and loadout options. There is an option to adjust the weapon model to fit your gunstock. First I\\'ve seen of this.  Let me be clear, I meant what I said about the recipe being excellent, but I do think it needs a little time in the oven. There are a lot of small QoL features that will have to be fixed if this game seriously wants to compete with Onward/Pavlov. To me, the sauce is good enough to overlook these little things until they are fixed. That being said, they are:  Teammate icons face in/out when you are looking at them- this has led me to lots of friendly fire, because I will see a teammate and shoot them before the friendly tag has a chance to appear, making him seem like an enemy. We either need persistent friendly nametags that don\\'t go away, or more distinction between enemy/ally avatar models.  Holo Sights are slightly off to left. Not sure if I should ignore it and aim in the center to compensate, or aim with the off kilter crosshair.  Spatial audio is off - Gunshots seem fine, but footsteps need a lot of work in terms of spatial sound. Your steps only play through one ear, making you contsantly think there are people creeping on you.  Heavy armor needs a rework- The large movement penalty you get is not worth the small armor increase. You\\'re better off picking medium most of the time, unless you want two primaries with light armor. Theres literally no benefit to using it.  Mag release is menu button (above the trackpad) - Every other game is dpad down. Dpad down = mag drop, always. Solved with button mapping.  Fire selector is dpad down- Fire selectors are on the left/right side of weapons, so Dpad left or right makes more sense to me. Again, solved by adding button mapping support.  Optimization - Jury is still out on this. I have only played a short time, and only tweaked in game settings (havent played with SS but I usually just leave it at 1.7 across the board). Even with most settings on medium, or low, I was still getting some weirdness or stuttering some places. Could just be my computer though, but I have no problems running most other stuff on medium/high just fine. (i7 4790k @4.0, GTX 1080FTW and 16g ram)  Weapon scaling - Most weapons, some more than others, run a little small. In the case of a few, laughably so, like you\\'re holding a toy version of the original firearm. Lookin at you Steyr AUG. Bumping most of them up 10-15% in size would do the trick.   Respawn time- Personally I think it should be about half, maybe 10s tops. It\\'s frustrating losing points waiting for respawn, and kind of hollow winning that way. I\\'d much rather lose uplink progress in a satisfying firefight rather than because I was just absent from the battle. Its also more satisfying to win (personally) knowing you kept them at bay versus killing them and sitting in silence while they run back from spawn.  Decoy grenade uses wideley accepted flashbang model - Small gripe, just confusing at first. Personally I\\'d make the decoy grenade the yellow one and the flash the one its supposed to be.  I would like a PDA or a Map or something, would be useful for seeing where your teammates are.  A little short on content- (Im satisfied with the weapon count for now, but it could use another game mode, and maps, but thats EA life. More coming down the road.    Overall, these are small issues and I imagine most of which will be addressed by the devs. Like I said, the recipe is right, it just needs to be lovingly cooked to perfection, and then I think it could be a serious contender for one of the top VR shooters.\\n', 'this is a great little DLC, Badly needed for ATS as there was a lack of paintjob options in the configuration menu...Great Job SCS, Well worth it!\\n', 'No maintenance pad !!!\\n', 'Anyone else want to play as Ghost Pyrrha?\\n', \"Terrible.

But it\\'s still kind of garbage. First off, some good news for carehavers: 1. While the game obviously does throw around the trap word, like, A Lot, both of the love interests refer to each other with she/her pronouns, and the main character starts going along with it at the end. Points for that, I guess. 2. The human love interest is established as being in her twenties, and the scantily clad 300 year old kid in the screenshots is not part of the love triangle and gets no ero scenes. Big relief.  But other than that, it was just a little bit less than what I expected. From the prologue up until the cathartic yet wholly unearned climax, the story\\'s mostly just an alternating loop of one of two gorgeous trapgender women seducing our featureless protag, and the other one getting mad and calling her a skank or something. Any sex scenes have been edited out of this version, leaving not so much as a female-presenting nipple in sight, and let me tell you, this is not the type of visual novel that feels complete without the filth.  Other than that, my main complaint was that the way they wrote the shrine maiden, Mishiro, felt a little spiteful to me. Yui, the goddess, was established as haughty and competitive, but with a sensitive side, and that\\'s well rounded enough for a hentai game, but until the ending, Mishiro didn\\'t get to be much other than a jealous, vindictive psycho, and if not for the ending, I wouldn\\'t have imagined that the writers liked her at all. Was there some character development in those sex scenes that we missed out on? Also what the hell was up with that one joke about her not being rapeable. Gross.  So, yeah, it\\'s kind of trash, and it didn\\'t knock my socks off, but it didn\\'t make me want to travel back in time and tell myself not to spend ten bucks on it either. If there was an \"ehh *wiggles hand*\" option, I\\'d click that, but I figure that anyone looking at reviews for this thing is probably within the target demographic, so even though I don\\'t have much positive to say about it, I\\'m willing to bump my rating up to \"sure, whatever, go nuts.\"  Let the girls make out in the next one.\\n', 'i dont get the car \\n', \"It's a fun game. Sexy aspects aside, its core mechanics are incredibly solid and fun to play.\\n\", \"An incredible expansion. I've probably got 2,500 collective hours with Civ since Civ 4, and this expansion marks the absolute pinnacle of the series for me. It's a beautiful intersection of fearless design choices and thematics. And at long last...  THE LATE GAME DOESN'T SUCK.  On the contrary, I'm EXCITED to play the late game now. They also seem to have addressed some late game performance issues, too, to make it even more smooth. Managing climate, electricity, etc. is so satisfying. Diplomacy actually makes sense now, but dicks will still try to nab low-hanging fruit if you leave a city vulnerable. If you strengthen your position enough, even warmongers will buddy up to you.  I'm a die-hard fan of Dido from Civ 5 and her (authentic) return as the leader of Phoenicia in this DLC is just amazing.  For those complaining about price, I paid $30 for Starcraft: Brood War in 1997. Inflation has risen considerably since then.

At the risk of sounding elitist, I have played pretty much every yuri game to be found on Steam (and countless others elsewhere), yet this is the first I've felt inspired enough to write a review for.  As a sort of romantic comedy story, Tower of Five Hearts is one of the most interesting I've ever come across. The basic premise is unique and fresh, and the whole game plays out as a very entertaining and heartwarming story, the kind where you'll find yourself grinning the whole time you're playing it. The characters are diverse and very well fleshed out; there's only six in the entire game, but they've got enough personality for sixty characters. There's six (yes six, not five) different paths one can take (as far as I've found so far), and while there's not a huge amount of differences between them, there's more than enough uniqueness to each route that it will be worthwhile to play through them all. The art is very cute, though not really in an eroge way, and well done overall; even the backgrounds are pretty good (for a Visual Novel).  If you're looking for a full blown hentai eroge (and you can deny it all you want, but that's probably what led many people to this), well, you won't find much here. The ecchi and explicit scenes are okay, but not the kind you buy an eroge to 'use'; indeed, it is more like they just threw them in after making the game. Now this sounds like a bad review for a game marketed as an eroge, but let me assure you, this is a game I recommend most highly. Not as an eroge, but as a romantic comedy, a yuri romance, and a 'healing' type story.  Please give it a try; it's more than worth your time.  And in case you wanted numerical statistic-type ratings: -Art: 8/10 -Story: 10/10 -Characters: 10/10 -Cuteness: 10/10 -Yuri: 11/10 -Ecchi: 6/10 -Hentai: 4/10 -Music: No idea I really wasn't paying attention to the music >.> \\n\", 'Great addition to already fun game!

Also after seeing Slayer call Zoe \"hot\" and then in another scene bringing up possibilty of having a crush on one of the people nearby(And Zoe being one of those)... it could be kinda cool to have a threesome ending with both of them or something, just a suggestion XD  Oh, and I think it doesn\\'t make much sense when on Slayer secret route to get the epilogue text about Slayer ending up in awkward threesome with Liam and Damien, considering that the whole route was about helping her overcome anger issues and trying to kill classmates(Also because we can kinda assume she is dating player character after that...).  I do have some concerns about some of Leonard\\'s lines(He does bring up legit good points held by anti-sjw side, but is obnoxiously sexist \"blackface\" representation of a nerdy neckbeard, and seems to have no counterbalance in form of some overly SJW character, because let\\'s be honest, there are obnoxious authoritarian people like that on both sides.), but people who call the the game SJW because of that and little things like pronoun choices are being too paranoid.

The first thing that comes to mind when trying to describe this game is \"obtuse\". When I first statrted playing, I was completely confused as onto what the game was expecting of me. Sure, getting from point A to B is a simple enough objective, but, where am I going to, exactly? What am I aiming for, here? How do I know that I\\'m going in the right direction? But most importantly: what do all these things around me do and why are they there?  The game seems to be designed as some sort of metroidvania, however, backtracking is very limited and mostly useless, since you won\\'t find equipment or useful items by going back to previous areas. In fact, the only reason why you\\'d backtrack is to find that one room that you could not pass through before and you don\\'t know if it was because the game is hard as balls, or because you were lacking somethnig, since the game won\\'t tell you whenever you have a new skill, nor what it does, and simply let\\'s you guess.   And by \"new skill\" I mean, \"you can now interact with a differently-coloured floating eyeball, which for some reason let\\'s you do stuff, go figure out what that stuff is, though\", which is really underwhelming.  The map seems to be separated in zones for reason, and certainly those zones look different, but that \"different\" offers no information nor anything valuable except for a slight change of background. The enemies are the same, the obstacles are the same, the puzzles are designed about the same ideas, etc.  Once you actually get the hang of what to do and how, the game is actually quite nice. Controls are tight, jumping feels good, and mechanics work the way they should. Though the game certainly doe sits best to lure the player into a death trap, most of the time death doesn\\'t feel unfair, and instead shows that the player needs to rethink their strategy or simply get better. The problem here is that diffitulty has some really weird spikes. The first boss is harder than the second or the third, and some stages are notoriously more challenging than others that come at later parts of the game. Also, the game designer seems to think that players really, really want to get those extra souls that are on dangerous spots or extra rooms, but on my first playthrough I got more than enough souls to get all upgrades and more than half the gallery withou farming and without those souls, which makes the extra challenge a bit pointless.  I will still recommend this game because it\\'s fun even with all its flaws, and because I think the developer deserves the chance to make more and better games.

My last session ended after taming and mounting a raptor after getting off of him again, he ran off like crazy, with all my other tames following him. They ran into one of the many therizinos and were attacked. All of my dinos were killed and I was not able to do anything.

If you like Silent Hill and appreciate the atmosphere of old school horror then this is a must buy. The only cons for me are that the game is pretty short (But it's pretty cheap, so the price is right). Most of my playtime comes from getting the game to run how I like. Which brings me to the next con. You can't alt-tab out of this game, don't try either because your shit will crash and it'll be a bad time since this game uses good ol' fashioned save rooms. Either you wanna alt-enter first and then alt-tab OR just get borderless gaming for free and try that. Either way all bugs and minor gripes aside, this game is an experience. It's got great music, and it's got the spooks to go along with it on the side.\\n\", \"[h1]Good for weebs and non weebs. Good game fun.[/h1] [spoiler] Don't hit The Empress.

Although the DLC doesn't give a TON of playtime, it is rather fun. I like the addition of food, and more health. I used to have 10k+ Pons, but then I found the food stands and went down to 6k in around 3-4 hours playtime. Mostly because food, but also because of the new clothing and dyes. Oh, and the Nyakuza Outfit is cute. I also like the addition of the new cutscenes and all the new animations and the ability to communicate with other players.  It's quite difficult to navigate around at first, but don't worry. In the center of it all there's a guide map you can get for around 100 pons. It turned off after one use, but I already could find my way around after that. I super duper recommend this DLC because it's really fun and adds quite a bit to the experience.\\n\", 'Great addition to CIv VI. I am a huge fan of the gathering storm mechanics and global warming, it presents it in a way that even the most closed minded climate change denier could understand whats going on and why its important.

If all of your men are afflicted by the sleep they die, but they wont die on their sleep if you have a brother that wakes you up.   The hexes are a more troublesome but hey, witches can bewitch people , so dont blame if they bewitch one of your brothers and you are forced to kill him. That's the challenge in it. Kill the witches ASAP before you kill more of your brothers.

My only minor gripes are that you can\\'t turn on vsync, and the crawling giant baby boss gives no indication that weapons now harm him during the second fight, where you must trap him beneath the door. Having his heart exposed or something while he is struggling to hold the door up would have conveyed that you can now harm him with weapons.   Enemy designs and variety were excellent. I think I noticed some Zdzislaw Beksinski influence in one of them. By the time an enemy type became less scary, there was already a new one appearing. This never tapered off as it does in most games, it kept introducing new enemy types up to the very end.   Anyways, many games ape the aesthetic of Silent Hill. Organ Quarter for example. But few of them go beyond that and are polished, excellent games on their own merits. This one had some really creative scripted scares, tension building moments and fakeouts which were much more effective than the standard jumpscare. It really got me a couple times and that\\'s hard to do. I wanted this game to genuinely frighten me, and it did.   One thing I\\'d like to see in a future title would be less formulaic progression. Twice in the game I had to seek out three switches, or three emblems, to proceed. I can imagine more story appropriate, less \"game-like\" tasks to complete. Frictional\\'s puzzles typically fit the world they\\'re in and are the sort of barriers which you might really expect to encounter, and have to overcome, in that situation.  I left a needlessly harsh review once on Spooky\\'s Jumpscare Mansion because it didn\\'t allow the use of Touch controllers as a gamepad substitute as well as lacking some menu options I wanted. I still regret that and now I see the developer was headed for bigger and better things. There were many elements in Lost in Vivo which struck me as prettier, more polished sections of Spooky\\'s Jumpscare Mansion, but not overly so. Recognizably the two share some DNA but Lost in Vivo is in all ways a more developed and complete effort.   If I compare it to the Silent Hill games, it fixes most of the common gripes. First person instead of third. More comprehensible puzzles and reasonable difficulty. More straightforward story, but similar themes of mental torment manifesting horrors. That\\'s an unfair comparison though as Silent Hill pioneered the qualities which we now see copied in many other games. It\\'s like holding Lovecraft up to the standard of all the later horror authors he inspired.  I am thoroughly pleased and satisfied with this game. It was well worth what I paid for it and I excitedly look forward to future games from this dev.  What troubles me is that the six armed creature you fight in the mines shows at one point that it can shapeshift to imitate your dog. How do we know the dog waiting at the top of the ladder in the good ending is the real one?\\n', 'An absolute terrifying experience, Lost in Vivo has a knack for reeling you in and scaring the shit out of you, or even worse, do nothing at all.   The gunplay is incredibly satisfying, while finding rounds for your weapons is a great buttery feeling. Some enemies die in a bloody pop while others are simply only momentarilly stunned before continuing their hunt for you.  Lost in Vivo is an amazing storyteller, providing disgustingly raw points of view through metaphorical gameplay. The setting and tone of every area forces the player to question who the main character actually is.  Despite a slightly large price for a 2-4 hour game containing occasional bugs, Lost in Vivo is an amazing experience for any indy or horror fan.\\n', 'Absolutely worth the wait for the Nyakuza metro, especially for the Online party A bit short though, but..

I loved the original Tasty Planet and was thrilled to play the sequel when I found it. However, this game, I just can't recommend.  It's got some QoL stuff such as no longer being limited by time, as long as you finish you unlock the next level (however, bonus levels are locked by collected stars which require you to do well anyways). That's about the only advantage it's got over other games.  Tasty Planet Forever features multiple characters (they're functionally the same, it's literally just a skin) and for this reason, it feels inferior to the previous games. Each character has an origin story, some comic showing where it came from, and that's all you get. The character eats everything and then you move on to the next character. There's just a lack of continuity and closure. This is the kind of game that wouldn't really need it, however as previous games had some kind of story, the lack of it in Tasty Planet Forever feels lazy.  The actual level design itself also feels a bit like a downgrade. The final Grey Goo level had Nebula's, a purple and green one, three growth stages in a row. The exact same icon. Earlier stages featured mountains and craters over and over again across like 2-3 stages.  I can't recommend this game purely because I feel that the previous games are superior and that you should purchase those instead.\\n\", 'I had to endure 2 minutes of a blowjob scene with fake moaning which made me very uncomfortable, I am very disturbed right now.\\n', 'no update since forever......\\n', \"Having played the original Pong on an Atari console, I thought that playing Beach Pong would be a bit of retro fun. However, I found the paddles in this version of pong to be poorly-responsive (from memory, I believe that the paddles in the original black and white Pong were more responsive than in this game).  I thought I would do the achievements for Beach Pong, as winning was easy enough - but the game kept on stuffing up. Set up a 15 win game, win every one of the 15 rounds, and the game keeps on going. What the frick? Get to about 10 wins in a row, and the game starts going into pause mode after every win (this happened quite a bit). Again, what the frick?  Bought Beach Pong on sale for about 50 cents, but still feeling a bit ripped off. No way should anyone buy this for the full price; in fact, I would suggest that you don't buy it at all.  Unless you're an achievement hunter, you shouldn't waste your time with Beach Pong. Sorry, but this game is a bit of a fail.\\n\", 'Still alot more work to do.

MUSYNX is a good gateway drug to rhythm gaming, giving you a pretty generous timing and it\\'s *heavily* accuracy based (the timing for the maximum theoretical score of 125% is +/-[b]1ms[/b]), so missing a note is not as big of a deal as other rhythm games with combo-based scoring. That said, being off with your note hits are going to have a noticeable effect to your music listening experience so getting the timing as close to perfect as possible is still your main objective. The game does have a Sound Enhancer feature, correcting the keysounds depending on the value you set it on to improve the music listening experience even if you suck.  A lot of the music are from Chinese and Japanese indie DJs so it is an acquired taste, but this is pretty much expected for a regular Asian rhythm game. That said, you can find some soundtracks for a few games like Opus, ICEY, and even Nekopara for some reason.   I highly recommend you try this game out, with the Friends Forever pack if you want to enter the world of rhythm gaming. This is a good introduction to standard 4K/6K gameplay of a lot of rhythm games (specifically mobile rhythm games) and keysounded gameplay. While the Smartphone versions of MUSYNC are available to download for free, a lot of the good songs are locked behind purchase except if you buy the Forever Friends pack, which costs 30 USD -- a big price gap compared to the Steam version. Besides, this is an objectively superior version due to the use of physical buttons rather than touchscreen with massive input delay, which is detrimental to the keysound-dependent gameplay.\\n', 'Jokes aside, it fires a missile made of fork like objects that works similar to charged bullet. \\n', \"This game is suprisingly fun.

It's almost like a relaxing more 3D version of BLOXORZ if you've ever played that flash game before because you have control of the main camera so you can look around and things like that.

Clock Remains includes a pair of rather vanilla dungeons. One opens up to another, the latter of which has a boss. In addition, there's a set of puzzle dungeons that revolve around Sakuya's danmaku set. If you like the puzzle dungeons in the base game, this should be pretty satisfying. You get decent rewards out of it too.  Sakuya is the main highlight of this DLC. Her danmaku (which can viewed in the game along with danmaku for all the other characters whether or not you have bought/unlocked them) includes a straight shot that can bind, a three-way shot, a forward teleport, and a timestop. The first three are pretty basic, but the last one, Sakuya's World, is godly. You can use it to stop time during boss fights and spam Spell Cards in their face, which can be a little broken in runs where you're allowed to bring items, since you can grab a lot of Spell Cards to bring. I haven't encountered that many bosses yet, but for situations where you can use Sakuya as a player character, she serves as a great boss-killer. Her only downside is a lack of proper AoE danmaku, but it's worth the boss-killing potential.  Dungeons: 7/10 (rather vanilla, but the puzzle dungeons are fun) Story: 7/10 (no spoilers here) Sakuya: 10/10 (great boss killer. Her binding shot is also good. Also she's a maid.)

The character creator has a vast amount of options that lets you edit a huge amount of various things about your character. There is no game out there better to create a fursona with. Not only is the character creation brilliant you can try out your characters ingame in a vast world completely open for you to explore.  Character Creation - Currently 2 races to choose from (this WILL change) felines and canines - Colours for all sorts of body parts such as paw pads, nose, mouth and eyes are very easy to do and there are no restrictions as to which colours you can use. This includes fur pattern! - Sizing is easily adjustable for breasts, penis and vaginal parts however the sizing for breasts is a little limited - Overall body structure is easy and fun to manipulate but most characters have a more feminine body structure so a strong muscly wolf dude is not possible for you gay furs out there.  - Many fur patterns to choose from however no iconic ones such as tiger stripes, cheetah/leopard spots. (I want these NOW)  Gameplay - Huge map, but empty and very little to interact with, map seems generated and there is little to look at when exploring - You can hunt other furries in the wilderness and trap them and ensnare them, thus the name \"hunt and snare\" (Equip gun with q, this took me a long while to figure out) - Furs are captured by firing the gun which uses tranquilizer darts and contains 2 shots. Not much to it yet but more features definitely going to come soon. - Captured furs are more like partners as you can have sex with them in 4 different positions for each combination of sex be it male/female, male/male, female/female (I\\'m assuming interaction is also possible with transexual characters however I have not tried this yet) - Sex interactions feature many different camera angles, speeds of the intercourse, and a zoom function - Small amount of story, you can interact with some characters in the game and chat with them to learn about them and their stories. Also to have sex with them. Sex with story. - Walking/Running animations are beautifully done and jiggle bones just make the whole thing so much better.

You can choose the various themes designed for the song or you can select an easier to digest standard theme that doens't have all the flashing and the like. (It's also really good for practicing).  Furthermore, you can change the tempo of the song and if you look at the screen shots you'll see 4k mode.  That's not the resolution but in fact a setting for your keyboard.  4K is four fingers, two to each side.  6K is six fingers and is signicantly more difficult.  Either way I digress.

The core structure is fun and enjoyable but the game has some pretty nasty flaws that will affect your experience. Many of these things can be adjusted through mods thankfully but the biggest one of them all in my experience have yet to be conquered by the community. It's the incredibly dumb and basic AI. I am sad to say that this did affect both mine and my friend's experience quite a lot as we lost tamed creatures set to follow only to spend more time looking for them finding them stuck on a rock somewhere. The AI is not aware of most of its surroundings. Creatures drown themselves on the edge of water structures, swim in endless circles in the a river when set to roam (gotta say that was the worst beaver we ever owned. Didn't gather much wood at all), dimorphodons flying through your open doors and then stuck somewhere on the wall failing to find a path out or massive dinos walking into structures to small for them and get stuck. The bad AI made the roaming feature a disaster because these dinos are more suicidal than a toddler with a fork close to an electrical outlet. At least some of them. Others did fine just walking around without a purpose since that's how the AI is coded for wild creatures and most of the dinos you set to roam. These are things that I would like to see the devs to fix but if I could dream they would also make the AI advanced enough to give us different behaviours. Currently, dinos do not interact with each other unless hunter/prey. Supposedly social herbivores are apathetic to their surroundings until you either show or with more docile species even attack them. I would like to see behaviours, grazing animations, herds behaving like herds, even sleeping (I think I've only seen one species being able to sleep), drinking, awareness of the surrounding individuals and just natural behaviours. The creatures in this game truly seem aimless and non-personal. Another feature which is cool but executed pretty bad is the colour mutations. I do love the idea but the colours picked are the brightest yellow, brightest red, cyan blue, etc. It's an eyesore. I own a panther chameleon myself, one of the most colourful animals alive being blue and red but there is a massive difference between being colourful and being colourful with the most saturated colours you could find in MS paint. My direwolves had a bright red puppy, redder than a stop sign and my eyes bled. One day, mods might fix this since this seems to be on a modable level. There are other things that bother me but thank God for the modding community. At last, I would also like to mention if you're a pre-history nerd who loves accurately represented creatures. YOU.WILL.CRINGE. But if you're willing to see past all of this Id rate it 6.5/10, I'd play it again and rage at the AI again because it is still a fun game and bonus is, the AI is bad enough you might see the dino you are chasing with sleep darts getting stuck on a wall somewhere and there you go, a low effort tame!\\n\", 'This game is great. Shame i gather itll get boring after a few goes but for the price its a great game and something to always come back too..\\n', 'These are my early impressions of this game. I picked this one up because it is dirt cheap and it is available for Linux, honestly I didn\\'t have much expectations for a game that costs less than a simple meal. This game feels very much like a B-Movie (which is to be expected for the price), but if you can look beyond the budget there is some serious ambition and quite a lot of work behind it.   The game is an open world RPG set in france during WW2. You basically start being airdropped in the countryside and quickly meet the french resistance, which even though they talk very funny to my surprise is FULLY voice acted. I think this is something to praise since honestly I wasn\\'t expecting. From there you get several missions like collecting supplies and searching for lost patrols.   You run into action quite early, so the gunplay, it is not the best, but it is certainly quite decent. The weapon bob is quite exaggerated but it makes fast shooting seem a bit chaotic. Some weapons are enjoyable to use, particularly the mp40 and the rifles. The game seems to have quite a lot of weapons, on my short play session I found a Mp40, a Kar93, the stg-44, a Sten, and the merchants sell stuff like the M1 Garand, the french Lebel, and some machineguns .   Another big surprise was finding a german car and actually being able to use it, as well as a motorcycle. The driving isn\\'t great but is usable.   Graphically I would say this game looks a bit like the first Medal of Honor (Allied Assault) , in some aspects it is a bit worse (some textures and models) and in some aspects is a bit better (some shaders for example). There are some small issues like depth of field being a bit too overused and jump all over the place, also sometimes there is a lot of pop-in despite my graphics card clearly being able to handle the game smoothly. There is a lot of grass and hills and that makes combat exciting, sometimes making it hard to see where the enemy is shooting at you.  The UI is very basic, the menus are pretty much spartan, showing you only what you need to see and letting you tweak graphics.   I am not certain if there is any \"stealth\" system, but I have managed to come very close to the enemies without them noticing, so it makes me think it can be done in a stealthy way. Most missions seem to be able to be approached from any direction and with any weapons you manage to get, in a  \"sandbox\" fashion  So if I had to give a veredict, I would say that I am enjoying the game and I plan to finish it, so it is pretty good for the price. It has some pretty ambitious concepts and you can tell the devs were thinking big, which make me wonder: what could these developers do with some more money?  If I would recommend it? If you are looking for an interesting experience for a small price and are willing to put up with some budget quality here and there, less than stellar voice acting and a bit of glitchy graphics I would say go for it.\\n', 'This game is like shadow warrior but with a mix of some futuristic stuff.\\n', \"Easily one of the best skateboarding games out there.

Easily worth the money I spent.\\n\", \"It pains me to write a negative review of this game as I've been playing it from the beginning but it's just yet another early access VR game that's making progress at a snails pace and is even worse in some aspects than launch.   For starters, the positives - Graphics of everything but the character model are awesome. The levels especially look great for the most part. The only thing I hate is how the body and hands look so weirdly disproportionate (the hands especially). - Shooting mechanics are great - Nice variety of weapons - Core game mechanics are solid  Negatives: - Game runs like ass. On my 1080ti/4790k I regularly get slow down and stutter. This seems to have got a lot worse lately. - Servers are dead for the most part. You might be lucky in the evenings and find a game or two but that's about it. - I've had a number of occasions where games have been ruined by cheaters - This has THE WORST of AI implementation in a shooter I have ever seen in my life. I tried it for the first time today and picked one of the bigger Maps. put the max (only 10) AI enemies and set it to the hardest difficulty. After walking forward for 20 seconds, literally all 10 enemies just rushed at me in a straight line at the same time. Absolutely ridiculous. Why bother even putting it in the game if you're going to do it this lazily.   I could go on but I think you get the point. Like I said, it pains me to write this review as I had exceptionally high hopes for this game when it first came out but I really just can't recommend it in it's current state and I have no faith that it's going to be improved much given the incredibly slow progress from the devs and the steady decline in players.

I kind of liked the artwork, but it gets a thumbs down for the actual gameplay.   The game works like this. Complete a 5 X 4 jigsaw of a woman in a skimpy outfit. Skimpy means bikinis for the most part. There is no actual nudity. When you’re finished with the puzzle, you don’t just see a still image. Instead, the woman jiggles a little bit. There is a sample of this at the end of the video on the store page. The store page mentions 21 levels, but there are only ten women in the game. There are ten levels with a gray background image as a guide and then the same ten pictures are repeated without the background guide. The final level is the phrase, “Anime Pixel Girls.”   These are the problems with gameplay. When a level is completed, the game then starts the next level automatically. There should be some sort of pause so the next level doesn’t start until you’re ready. There is no gallery available. There should be a gallery available when a level is completed. There is no option to adjust the size of the pieces. It’s always a 5 X 4 puzzle. There is no ability to start from a selected level. You have to start all over from the beginning each time. In addition to all that, there was some sort of bug, so I wasn’t able to take screenshots using Steam. Not a major issue, but that’s something that should be fixed.  Final verdict. Not really recommended, but if you want to try it, wait for a sale. I got it on sale for 59 cents. That’s about what it’s worth.\\n', \"Right now it's not worth it. The controls are smart, but I prefer the Skate controls way more. You can't steer while you crouch to pop. Everything you slightly bump into sends you off your board. Can't walk. You spin using triggers which I find annoying. Needs a lot of work. I requested a refund as I simply don't find it playable right now. Will see what happens as time passes. Great effort thus far but I can't honestly reccommend anyone spend this amount for this content.\\n\", 'Fun game. It basically throws challenges at you (which you can pick before the game starts), which you in turn master with a hero of your choice, and the use of spells or items. Some of these operatives are better suited to a specific challenge than others.  You get to pick one of these heroes or so called operatives before the game starts, but there are many more on the playing field, waiting to be picked up by you as you play.  The real fun in this game lies in figuring out a long-term plan on how to beat the challenges. Even the same scenario can play out vastly different depending on the character you pick. After picking some of the easy mode constellations (for example, one requires you to have two of the resource \"lore\". There is a hero that generates lore just like that, i.e. auto-win), I voluntarily chose some combinations that I knew would be hard to beat.  For anyone struggling with the game initially, I recommend picking an easy scenario and travel to all the locations, memorize what kind of people can be recruited where, wait a few turns on these fields to get a feeling for the adventure cards in these locations etc.  It took me an hour or two at most, and after that I already had a pretty good grasp of what I could get where, and how I am going to use that in a long-term strategy.  Some tips: 1. You appear to always start with a random spellbook. Use it at your earliest convenience. 2. Spending a few turns in the Museum District will eventually unlock two shops: One for spellbooks, and another for rare items. Both are invaluable, especially if RNGeezus mocks you with a blood magic spellbook on startup. 3. Spending a few turns in the Elven District, you eventually get several events that allow you to \"befriend\" the elves. That has no immediate effect. AFTER they are befriended though, there are - several - different events that can permanently increase the \"arcane\" stat 4. Easily overlooked, right in the starting location, the hideout, there is a recruitable named \"mentor\", who grants a chance to raise the tranquility stat. You should foster at least one \"high-sanity\" mage for almost every challenge. 5. Tool Tips, there are a lot of them, and taking the time to read them makes a world of a difference.  6. In the Harbor District, you will more often than not get the opportunity to get a rare item for a real low price. A few of these rares are real game changers.  Given some patience, you will figure out more of these as you go, and will eventually realize that you can exploit the playing field in whichever way you want once you figured out how and where. \\n', 'ALICESOFT!

First I want to explore more new games out of my confort zone, test a non-stop action game like this and give oportunity to indie games as well, like my  \"The Vargant\"´s analysis. Then, it attracted my curiosity looking from the list of the new games (in that period) i clicked and look to the video´s trailer and i felt impressed that one single person do an incredible presentation of a first person gameplay with several weapons sequenced at the same time (asians are incredible) and with fluid moviments. So the price is reasonable to me so i bought.    The menu Is versatile, that he moves acordling you select the buttons and nothing abnormal to apoint         The grapichs  it\\'s expected from a early acess games (until now), not so good or bad, is in conforms: the scenarios are pretty well as the propourse of the game. unfortunately to me i have to play in the lowest configuration and low resolution to play with 15 ~ 20 fps   The gameplay  its new to me, a futirist-like game with a with several combinations of combo and diverse styles of weapon, from firearms to technological equipment; you can jump, run, dodge,shoot with a pistol, shotgun and a submachine gun, use the left arm to push enemies , grab in expecific structures, and use the technological equipaments to a higher jump, upgrade your combos, status and unlock new features with the XP you obtain killing enemies. The more you deal damage, the more a points counter goes up and gives you a rank according to the points obtained: depending on the combos and skills used.  but what struck me is how such actions can be done with such lightness of quick button clicks. Ex: while you shoot with the submachine gun you use the EMP to shoot them in the air and at the same time jump and attack with the sword and can end with a quick change to the shotgun. the pause menu gives the feeling that the game is still rolling in slow motion, is cool.   Problems I\\'ve see   I cannot opine about the frame rate, because the entire game in my PC  stayed by 5-20 fps oscillating a lot even in menu, except in the boss battle and scenarios with no enemies stayed by 12-18 fps   Some enemies spawn in random areas that be difficult to carry on. once a enemy spawn in right front of me and i simply can´t see him shooting on me and died with no reason (i thought in the first time, but occurred to me more times)    minor Render bugs that made me leave the map and walk for 5 seconds until I fell into limbo and died (it was funny at least)      finally, i like this game, acoppany the updates and playing slowly (100 minutes for now) because i need to have patience to play in this fps and congrats to the developer who did a great job like this and continue with their jobs.\\n', 'After buying the game i was amazed by the graphics but was disappointed in how the game developers treats their community and the insane amount of bugs the developers have neglected to fix do not waste 60$ on a game like this. \\n', 'The second part is as good as the third, so I advise!\\n', 'This game is worse than pavlov.

The game is complete as it is and the only thing missing is \"Hardcore Mode\", and the developer says even that will be added next month. During my playthrough I encountered one single bug, and that requires you to do specific thing and exactly the right spot and I don\\'t think anyone else is going to experience it.  So what is REDO! ? It\\'s an short and sweet little metroidvania game set in distant future where you go on a quest to find another human who sent you an message. It\\'s not an long game, but I personally think it\\'s pretty much the perfect length. It takes about three hours to complete, depending on how good you are at metroidvania games. It has enough weapons, items and bosses to make things interesting but it never overstays it\\'s welcome. And with price of 8.19€, roughly the price of a good beer at a bar or a meal at some fast food place, I think it\\'s priced just right.  What it does to make it different from other metroidvania titles is the stamina system. Not for you, but for the enemies. When enemies attack or you attack them with either melee or few other weapons, their stamina goes down. And when it runs out they will be stunned or run away. This is a clever mechanic as it\\'s tied to health and ammo pickups. The only way to regain back the health or ammo, other than using a save spot that spawns all the enemies again, is to make them run out of stamina before killing them.  At first the difficulty can be quite punishing, but as you gain more weapons and learn how the enemies attack and move, it becomes much easier. I think this is why some people call it a bit like \"Dark Souls\", but I think it\\'s more like \"Cave Story\" but with slower pace. You need to use the right weapon for right enemy, and dodge when necessary, but the game itself is not so hard it makes you want to pull your hair out and throw the controller through the window.  The other thing the game has going for it is the atmosphere and mood. I think the closest thing to compare it to would be \"Lone Survivor\". You learn the lore of the game by reading diary entries and speaking to few NPC\\'s scattered around. But I think the most important thing is the environment. From the fog to dead people hooked to machines to the decay you see everywhere really reminds me of \"Lone Survivor\". Not in the same \"Silent Hill\" way, but as you being the last human around.    Overall I heartily recommend REDO! for everyone looking for a nice indie metroidvania, or just about anyone who is just sick how big but empty games these days have become. It\\'s tight game that you can play on one sitting, just the right length and I think the right difficulty.

CONS: - If you don't want the fastest scrolling speed, you need to adjust this at the start of each new song. - Though there are many songs, most of them are in the same sort of style... And I found only a few to be really fun to listen to. - There is no tutorial or explanation when first starting the game. Not even a quick overview of where everything can be found/what everything means. Definitely not recommended for people who haven't played this type of game before. - As far as I can see, you can only play individual songs on 2 difficulties (and with 4 or 6 fingers). There isn't a career mode or anything.  So basically, you just pick a few songs you like to play and you play them. You get a score at the end, but I don't really feel like the score matters in any way. There seemed to be a few unlockable/purchaseable songs as well, but I didn't really look into it. I feel like, if I'm an hour into a game and I'm still not really having fun, then it's just not a fun game.  So not recommended by me. Even when it's on sale, it's not really worth the cash to get through an hour of alright gameplay.\\n\", 'he small honk got me heart\\n', 'The art in this fun party racing game is excellent, and the different cars and characters makes a huge difference in gameplay variety when fighting your friends.

It's very rare (and as far as I can remember I never did that)  - Lots of cool mechanics, power-up system is nice, though I wish there was a glory kill as well as a parry mechanic, and maybe some way to mix grappling and sword play (for example grab an ennemy and finish it with the sword), or gun and sword. But it looks very very promising, it's like Doom & DMC had a child. - Difficulty seems fair and balance, though sometimes enemies can corner you and it gets really hard to dash out of damage - beautiful visuals, some weird fog effect that totally blinds you sometimes but it's not frequent - musics are kinda cool, which is rare to see in a FPS these days (appart from the one touched by the grace of Mick Gordon) - minor bugs like enemies stuck in a bottomless pit can happen (not very frequent but still)  Conclusion : yes sir. Please more. I'm very impressed this game was apparently done by one single guy. Congrats dude, can't wait to see more to be honest. There is definitely an indie (personnal) GOTY potential here (when the game fully releases). So, yep, please give this guy a chance...  ===============  French ver :   J'ai fini le jeu une fois l'avoir acheté et lancé (ce qui ne m'est jamais arrivé avant)  - Y'a des mécaniques vachement cool; ce serait bien qu'on en ait un peu plus car le potentiel du jeu a l'air de se retenir encore. Imaginez qu'on puisse, par exemple, combiner grapin et coup d'épée ou épée et flingue - Quelques bugs qui peuvent dérouter du genre un ennemi qui se plante dans un vide et ne bouge plus et qu'on ne le voit pas (du coup on a l'impression que la fin du combat ne se charge pas) - Les graphismes sont beaux à part quelques effets de fumée un peu dégueu qui peuvent nous aveugler - La difficulté ça a l'air ok, même si des fois on peut se faire bloquer par une horde d'ennemi et se faire meuler - les musiques ça passe, y'a l'air d'avoir une petite BO sympa en préparation  Conclusion : on est définitivement face à de la bonne came, là, les cocos. Donc j'attends impatiemment de voir la suite parce qu'on pourrait avoir un petit GOTY quand le jeu sortira (sachant que les journalopes vont tous se ruer sur les AAA chiants et insipides que quelqu'un nous sort forcément chaque année,)... donc ouais, donnons ça chance au joyeux luron qui a fait ce jeu.\\n\", 'I love this game ^-^\\n', \"It's ok.\\n\", 'if you have a bad pc this is not a game u will like.\\n', 'Best vr shooter yet!

Now you can work to turn the Red Planet Green, and in the process, not just survive, but Thrive.   The DLC Includes   -Several Buildings which are Terraforming oriented, such as Greenhouse Gas Factories, CO2 Factories, Plant Seeders, and Lakes.  -Terraforming functions in 4 main areas, Atmosphere, Heat, Water, and Vegetation. Atmosphere is the composition of atmosphere, 100% means you can breathe in it, and higher atmosphere negates meteor showers, dust storms, and other disasters. Heat is how close to Earth-Like temperatures Mars is. Higher heat means liquid water, rain, toxic rain, and the end of Cold Waves. Vegetation is the amount of greenery on Mars, and is gained from a new resource, Seeds.   -New Projects. These are your bread and butter when it comes to terraforming. Eventually, using buildings to Terraform hits a wall, and your gains are reduced, forcing you to use projects to advance it. Vegetation is the biggest and longest one to do as it's gains from seeders almost completely stop at 40%.   My Verdict : It's good, adds an endgame to Surviving Mars and makes the planet quite beautiful in the process. However it does take forever (which is kinda realistic in a way).   I'd say this is pretty much a necessary DLC for the game, get it when you can.\\n\", \"The game is great in serenity and though it has its bugs there is just too much wrong with it even though it is in Early Access. 20% of the time you are actually making swords and the other 80% of the time is waiting to sell 1 sword at a time.

However it is way too easy to screw up the world and melt all the polar ice caps. I played a game as Sweden and had a zero carbon footprint the entire game, never made use of oil or coal or uranium and even with a culture of 900 per turn, I was able to research the carbon mitigation civic to reduce the worlds carbon footprint but I just wasn't able to stop global warming no matter how hard I tried. Even with all my cities doing carbon recapture projects the rest of the world would pollute so much that I couldn't stop global warming from getting out of control. I think going forward in newer patches of this game that they will have to make the carbon impact on the environment not so harsh, using coal oil and uranium should have a weaker effect on the environment. Although at the same time you can protect your coastal cities from rising ocean levels with flood barriers, and the overall effect of global warming really in't that bad in this game, at max level of CO2 in the atmosphere natural disasters percentage of happening is only increased from 10 to 15%. Going forward I would like to see the impact of global warming be more severe, more punishing, that would be more realistic. I love the World Congress though, I won a diplomatic victory with Canada and I personally believe it is the hardest victory to obtain, even harder than culture victory. The other thing I noticed is that the other civilizations are far less likely to declare war on you with the new grievance system. This is good because with Rise and Fall it seemed the game was almost exclusively war based, and that took away from the other appealing aspects of the game. With the new grievance system this is improved and war only happens with justified reasons.

While playtime compared to cost is a little lacking if you like to judge games in that manner, personally I enjoyed this so much that I completely forgot about that.  If you played SC2VN then this game is a prequel with the antagonist, Bolt, as the focus point. There are other characters you will recognise from the SC2VN cast but I won't mention those here to allow for the story to introduce them to you.

For the base price, you get 48 songs, while the Forever Friends DLC nets you all current and future DLC songs (85 as of writing this review). Though you're not likely to recognize many, if any, of the songs, they're I've mostly been enjoying them (there's a lot of synthesized vocals, if you're into that). Each song has two difficulties and charts for 4 and 6-key versions.  The PC specific options are pretty limited, with just two graphics options for high-or-low spec. However, the general options are solid. You can alter the timing of the visuals and the judgement to account for input lag, change the speed of incoming notes, adjust whether or not missed notes are played, and switch between a 3D display where notes travel in towards you and a 2D display where they travel vertically down the screen.  Keybinds can be remapped if the default DF JK (and SDF JKL) bindings aren't to your liking. However, the game didn't recognize my controller, so you may need to take some extra steps if you don't want to play on a keyboard.  MUSYNX is extremely approachable for beginners, with no game-over states and no punishment for hitting the wrong notes (just for missing the right ones). This is further emphasized by a scoring system that makes getting good ranks extremely easy, but expert players can still find plenty of replay value thanks to the Sync Rate, which will continue to increase until you hit every single note in a song with <1ms deviation (for a perfect 125% sync rate). I'm mostly fond of this approach, since it's great for beginners but makes it possible for skilled players to continually chase higher and higher scores. That said, there is no visual to help you distinguish anything more exact than a 45ms deviation, which might make chasing high sync rates frustrating for some.  The one area where the game is noticeably lacking is in its interface. Songs come in a fixed order, categorized by genre. You can navigate left and right and skip forward or backwards to the next genre, but apart from that, there is nothing to help you rapidly get to the song you're looking for. There are no options to reorganize the songs, mark favorites, or really anything. It's the most noticeably barebones part of the game, and is my one real disappointment with this package.  Despite the cumbersome UI, MUSYNX's wealth of songs and solid core mechanics make for a fun, if simple, rhythm game. If you're on-board with robots singing, it's a steal at its price point.\\n\", 'jesus fuck me what a best surprise! totaly recommend!\\n', \"I am surprized that people from discussions didn't come here, and dont started to complain about trans flag.\\n\", \"Fairly pleasant addition to Surviving Mars.

Are you gonna nerf all semi automatic shotguns in real life for being too overpowered next?  2.The glitch where you get stuck with one gun for the rest of the gun game round.   3.

The sound in this game is so terrible that I'm not even certain it's in stereo. It doesn't matter if someone's in front, behind, above or below you, it all sounds the same.  Even looking past all that, the broken hit registration makes every death feel unfair.

Those of us who pay attention to actual science understand how overwhelming over-inflated this issue is by the left. The obvious reason becomes apparent when all of their solutions involve more control and taxation. Not actual solutions.  Anyways that was slightly off topic as to why this is an issue. Game play wise I love the idea of natural disasters, but this virtue signalling bullshit of \"your carbon output\" is really annoying. I find it ironic how certain civs viewed as \"politically divisive\" have never made a return yet this shit was forced on us.

Pros - The physics feel solid, as a comparision Skater XL is in a more polished state than Sessions for example. - The gameplay is satisfactory. - The controls (playing on a xbox 360 controller) feel pretty good and it's challenging, instead of using one joystick for tricks and another for directions, the joysticks control the legs indepently.  Cons: - The game has a huge lack of content, not even a main menu or options. The playable area is pretty small. - I'm scared about the game being left over as many other early access titles that never fully release.

On the way you can choose to recruit or rescue any captives you find. Recruiting them brings them into your squad and they follow you throuigh the game fighting the enemy with you. They also each have a special skill.  The levels themselves are procedurally generated and although not very varied are fairly challenging. Each level has a boss towards the end, the ones I've faced so far haven't been that tough.  Once you die, you return to your base where you can upgrade skills, recruits and craft weapons with the money you've found playing the game.

The concepts introduced are hot, but not really expanded upon in interesting ways. In short there's better stuff out there that can provide more in that department.  However, I actually stuck around for a very good platformer. Good level design, which only a select few flaws at a couple points. I actually got into this just legitimately playing it as a game, and have been spending hours since I got it just playing through the levels, trying to see how far I can get. I might even consider streaming this (erotic content off, of course) just as a game alone, as it seems to be nice material for that.

There are so many other wierd stuff they do, i am sure many people already told you this, so i wont go to in depth. Please just fix it, it ruins a really good game. TBH i have ragequit a few times due to this issue.  Review:  I was really unsure to buy this or not, due to all the negative review from here, yet many streamers seemed to like it and i could see why this game could be good.  I took the chance and bought the game, ended up playing for 10 hours in a row xD This game is so much better than Fernbus and can only be compared on the busses. The map is awesome, love the steep and bendy roads! Still haven't been everywhere, far from. In the future more of the Canary Islands would be great.  The gameplay is great, i like how the management aspect works. I have looked forward to a driving sim game with actual in depth gameplay, like this actually offers. I REALLY hope they will stick more to this game than Fernbus, updating same graphics features, management features, tours and busses.  One wish to the developers, PLEASE update the AI!!! It gets stuck in gridlock jams, pull out from roads where they should stop. They just seem really dumb. That's my only big complain, i hope and expect to see this fixed in the future.  I will recommend this game, i had so much fun already and i am sure it's only the beginning :)\\n\", \"This game is fairly good with my only real complaints being the resolution and the kinda clunky way that you move the cursor with your keyboard. To be honest I wouldn't really mind even that if it was just a bit faster to navigate with. Otherwise it is a fun game that I do enjoy so far.\\n\", 'This expansion is fantastic and really changes the game, especially the endgame. Watching mars turn blue and green is very satisfying. It really revived the game for me and is one of the best 20 bucks i ever spent.\\n', 'kathryn best girl ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\\n', 'Gathering Storm looked like a promising new expansion to Civ6. I am a fan of the series since the second civ, only skipping the first one because i was too young. I can\\'t recommend it for now, and i will explain why:  First, the global warming feature. It reads really nice on paper, but the implementation isn\\'t great. Its just about rising sea levels. Why is this bad? Because you can counter most effects. Tornados, eruptions, and storms aren\\'t too bad at all. Flooding rivers and rising sea levels can COMPLETELY be countered. So no reason to worry. Extinction of animals? More desert tiles? Erosion? Nothing like that. Just the rising sea and it counter-measures. But the worst thing is, just coal is enough to start the melting of the poles. In my game, around 18XX, the sea starts to rise, just for burning coal to create electricity in the beginning of industrialization. Thats way too fast. You don\\'t have a chance to get to clean energy to counter this. The moment you get clean energy, the whole flooding thing is already done.  Second, the new ressource system is horrible. In the old system, you need 1 strategic ressource to build a unit in a city with an encampment district, or 2 if you want to build them in any city. With the new system, you get a flat amount (+2) per round per ressource depot. A unit costs 20 of a ressource to build, so a SINGLE (!) swordsman cost 10 rounds of ressource savings. Let that sink. Sure, you can trade, but the AI/other player have the same problems. Its hard to keep a healthy amouts of troops.  Its getting even worse with the modern ressources: Uran, oil and coal. You need them for fueling your troops and creating electricity. But they are so scarce, its not even enough to create enough electricity. Only way to get enough energy is to spam \"local clean energy\": Solarpanels, windfarms and offshore-windfarms. Don\\'t even think about building infantry or tanks!  In conclusion: they multiplied the need for ressources, but they don\\'t multiplied the spawn rate and/or yield per tile.  The science victory got nerfed, dunno if this is good or bad, but you need more time/projects to win with science. You can decide for yourself if this is good or bad. Some of the new features, like the world congress, are working fine, but they are overshadowed by the not working/lackluster features.  It feels like i am not playing a civilization game anymore. More like a strange anti-global-warming-cuddle-civ: Don\\'t build too much military, fight the global warming and build nice happy, green and clean energy buildings on every tile. For a high addon price!  If they patch things, i will change my review, but for now, i can\\'t say enough positive to justify a thumb up.\\n', 'Very broken refunded instantly\\n', \"Holy shoot i gotta praise this game for what it is, it's like chinese doom sci-fi with it's own slashing take.

Kept me hooked until the final boss in 1 play (for episode 1 at least). I recommend buying this game without a shadow of doubt. Especially when it's this cheap.

To sum up this game in a few words would simply boil down to \"if Silent Hill was an FPS\", now I most certainly ain\\'t the first nor last to put it that way but with the amount of inspiration drawn from the Silent Hill series it definitely serves well. While I most certainly would want to spoil my review into every nook and cranny about what I experienced and what the systems were, I\\'m instead going be an arse and say buy this game and play it for yourself; its a thorough nightmare ride better experienced blind than with people having to spill it for you, you\\'ll be trapped in the confines of the darkness below for about 2 to 4 hours.

Firstly is the sound mixing. Some enemies are so loud that I have to take my headphones off to progress. This could be completely fixed by adding a sound mixer with ambient noise, enemies, music, and other gameplay sounds separate. Instead, I have to choose between being able to hear ambient noise and music or being able to hear at all. Secondly, and maybe my game is glitched because this seems like a huge oversight, but I can't find any indicator of health. I tried to verify my game cache to make sure, but it says my game isn't missing anything. I can fight a wave of enemies and walk away with no sign of how injured I am, so I die immediately to the next enemy I see and have to go back to the last save room to do it all over again.

(DLC's not included)\\n\", '1. All maps seeds have changed, map seeds are the life blood of the game for MANY people  2. Nerf\\'s to all useable strong builds, now there is no \"meta\" builds, you are all \"meat\" and  everyone dies. We are back to the days of boosting health and running around naked. Joy.  3. You can no longer save scum new recruits, which when combined with point 2 basically makes the game unplayable. Save scum\\'n unique items has also been drastically nerf\\'d, DRASTICALLY. Meaning if you kept playing \"post/end game\" for the \"loot hunt\" now there is seriously no point. Twenty hours later one crap unique. Yeeeeaaah. The game is now only played by those who \"try to survive to ____ day\" and then bail. F*ck off.   4. New enemies which would be damn near impossible to kill with the OLD builds AND save scumming recruits are now a thing. Dying isn\\'t enough, now watch as your sh*t troops kill EACH OTHER or sleep through being slowly murdered. Picture the necroservants/goblin shamens with their zero cooldown on enemies that spawn mass sleeps and charms. Good times. And the response from the dev\\'s? Make them EVEN MORE difficult... Yep, got the message.  5. Saving the game and loading now takes literally 3-10x as long as it did before. Click \"quick save\" and pitch your tents. Loaded the game PRE DLC and tested, yes, it is still much faster. I don\\'t know what they did but reported crashes and saving taking as much as 10x longer is now a \"known issue\". Congrats.  6. Changes to unique armor that allowed some characters to be almost \"OP\" are now basically worthless.  For example, it was a pain in the ass to get Davkuls set BEFORE (check out the thread on it) but getting it was WELL WORTH IT because the set was god tier- it now clearly isn\\'t worth the effort to even go about getting it. They lowered its max durability, number of durability per turn repaired AND added more fatigue to the armor so that it screws with their new \"nimble\". Good work.  7. New enemies + new economy changes + more company deaths make the game EVEN SLOWER with even MORE random encounters that end with a party swipe GAME OVER, which was one of if not THE largest complaints with the game PRE DLC. We got the message.  8. RNG seems to be an even bigger issue than before (most likely bugs) with people reporting game logs reports that make zero sense- enemies hitting over 75% of the time, multiple battles, when they only have a chance to hit at 25%, etc. etc.  9. New retreating mechanics which somehow manage to add MORE RNG and slow the game down EVEN MORE, in a game that DRASTICALLY didn\\'t need either. You now have to watch as your people move space at a time to the exit getting chased and killed along the way. The f*cking dumbest thing I have seen implemented in this game to date. Period.  TLDR: The DLC added very little new content while making the worst parts of the game somehow worse and f*cking completely the few things it had going for it, which isn\\'t a surprise. The base game of Battle Brothers had SOME redeeming qualities DESPITE the dev\\'s and their moderators not BECAUSE of.

The psychological horror subgenre works by getting under the audience\\'s skin, and what better way to do that than having them straight-up tell you what scares them?  Except that\\'s not what this game does at all. The approach it takes instead could be summed up more accurately as \"OOH I\\'M INSIDE YOUR HOUSE! SPOOKY!! I DON\\'T LIKE YOU. ARE YOU SCARED OF ME YET?\". It\\'s cheap and juvenile, and it ruins the suspension of disbelief because I [i]know[/i] the game can\\'t get inside my house and kill me. When your premise, a personality test, is implicitly grounded in reality, you can\\'t present a completely unrealistic threat and expect it to work. There\\'s a lot of other silly stuff too, like repetitive stock audio of a man screaming, and some really cheesy writing that reminds me of stuff I made in early high school. Even at its best, the writing was just.. not spectacular. It felt like it could have come from any number of dime-a-dozen horror games that try to address the audience.  The only part of the game that really affected me were the jumpscares, which I hate on principle because they\\'re more startling than scary and take almost no real skill to execute. They weren\\'t even done that well, either - I saw the first one coming from a mile away, and the ones after that came in such quick succesion that I became numb to them entirely.  There is one good thing I can say about the game, and it\\'s that (outside of the silly cgi jumpscare man), the visual presentation really makes the most of what I\\'m assuming was a very low budget. The parts with the fullscreen images were actually pretty cool, and even though the text glitching effect wasn\\'t really necessary, it did at least look really good.\\n', \"Great game.

It's short, about 30-45mins, but I think it was worth the price and I replayed it couple of times just becasue I wanted more.   However it does have its flaws. It's not super polished in terms of animation and suffers from a lot of engrish (though it doesn't get in the way of the gameplay). Mechanically the platforming can feel a little clunky at times and the reloads on all the guns only give you ammo after the entire animation is complete; so there's no animation canceling like in most modern shooters.  Oh, and it's got a Dark Souls reference so that bumps it up a few points.\\n\", 'Incredible game, great graphics, smooth gameplay, How a game should be made.

This expansion adds major new elements with the storms, natural disasters and even climate change. They brought back the world congress which is nice but not sure why they did not have it in the base game. The new leaders are nice and I look forward to giving them a try. That being said I have not seen any reviews about this (maybe I didn't look hard enough but whatever) and I have to bring it up. The builders. I hate how they changed how builders function with this game compared to previous ones. I hoped they would change the scheme back to how builders functioned in previous Civs with this expansion. I hate that I have to use a trader to build roads between cities (unless you're playing as Rome and that is only to the capital). I understand the premise behind it, I just do not like it. It wastes so much time on a route that could be used to provide me more money. Furthermore, the natural disasters can come in and destroy improvements, which I have no problem with. They are destructive storms after all. If you like playing on the slower speeds (like marathon) like I do, it'll be a while before you can have a builder there to rebuild these improvements, assuming you do not have one tucked away somewhere. What if it obliterates more improvements than your builder can create? Have to wait for another to be built or to get enough money to buy one, with the slower the game speed the more expensive they are. It is not usually a problem but I don't want to have to spend a lot of money to rebuild the improvements. I would rather they just change the system back to previous Civs so I can keep my builders and have them come around when they finish other projects.\\n\", 'An incredibly fun DLC, with the new sections of each island opening up the possibility to connect them; allowing larger islands.\\n', 'Very good game.

I\\'m glad I bought it. However, I have to qualify my recommendation a bit.   The thing is, I\\'m nuts. When I was younger, and less bitter/broken/bleak/cynical/realistic/ pessimistic/nihilistic, I held the irrationally romantic notion of how wonderful it would be to love a ghost. To be free from the petty foibles that plague human-to-human relationships; to have love sublimated to its highest, purest form.  So, when I saw this on Steam, I was essentially forced to buy it for the premise alone. And I thank the creators for going with a somewhat odd, possibly hard-to-sell premise such as this. It reminded me of my more innocent and hopeful youth, of which few things are now capable.  That said, I would wager that most people aren\\'t equally besotted with the concept; and in that case, take my recommendation as you will.   As an impartial critic, I will say that some might object to the Christian bias of the game\\'s treatment of the afterlife. I have no strong inclinations for or against any particular religion (aside from pagan blood-feuds, hoorah!), so it didn\\'t bother me remotely.  Also, as a critic, I\\'ll say I wish the game had a few more choices, so as to make the ones that are there feel more crucial; it doesn\\'t seem like you can vary widely between playthroughs. But to be fair, I\\'ve only played through it once so far.  Also with critical neutrality (I say this to emphasize that I\\'ve taken off my \"I love ghost sex!\" hat), I believe the writer handled the characters well. It would take a particular kind of personality to be open to loving a ghost.\\n', 'OK\\n', 'I want to recommend this so much, since the first release was one of the first things I bought for my Vive when it released over two years ago, and I\\'ve re-watched it many many times.  Especially since there is only one review at time of writing. However, I must admit I\\'m a little bit disappointed with this new version  First the good things.  * Only an extra fiver if you own the original. * There is much more detail in the cockpits. (Which were already great in the original) * There are some nice new details on the gantry descent. * The astronauts now move around more and lip sync their lines. They look like they\\'re actually doing things a bit more. * There\\'s a really nice sunrise effect on the clouds on the first earth overview * Clouds layers in general seem much improved and look more 3d.  * Viewpoints have been tweaked slighty to better guide your eye to the ship etc. eg I previously watched many people completely miss the LM descent for example as they were watching the Command Module. * Many textures are much higher res, in particular the moon surface. * Armstrong now leaves footprints after describing how his boot leaves footprints.  But the bad * Higher res textures mean higher aliasing issues. Viewed in the original Vive there is pretty horrible shimmering on the cockpit text when it lights up, and absolutely horrific on the moon surface during the landing sequence. Obviously the high specular reflections on the external shots of the modules are problematic too. Running at 200% Steam SS improved matters somewhat but still pretty noticable. This is screaming out for some proper anti-aliasing options, Preferably some selective AA on the worst bits since the scenes are generally so static. * First earth overview has some wierd pulsating effect on the city lights which seems deliberate, so maybe it\\'s reproducing a genuine physical effect, but it looked strange and distracting to me. * Landing sequence high res ground texture noticably cuts off into a blurry mess in the distance.  * Landing sequence no longer kicks up dust when \"kicking up some dust\" is spoken * Lander windows have lost the dust/smear texture. Personally I really liked that on the original. * Armstrong\\'s footprints are now there, but frankly look pretty bad. Like the cheapest decal slapped on the grount texture. * \"Skip to the next section\" option seems broken on keyboard and only works 10% of the time. * Point lights still clip though geometry (eg roof lights inside lander, sun through window in one eye). This was in the original too. * There is some extra spoken audio inside the lander which sounds like normal voice rather than filtered over comms, but it isn\\'t directional.  Honestly I was hoping this would blow me away, since I love the original so much, but it just needs a little more polish IMHO. However, it\\'s still a fantastic and moving experience, so I heartily recomend it if you\\'ve never seen it before.\\n', 'Addictive game, I wish it was longer, but for <$4 no complaints at all.\\n', 'The tiles I try to place outside always come out crooked.

The visuals were were fitting. I liked the faint glow of the test portions. The visuals are not bad. They're the kind you'd seen in horror games but I found the macabre/dark psych(?) visuals to be the better ones.  For the gameplay (nature of the game) the devs definitely achieved their goal, showing there are more ways to experience the horror genre.  Apparently another goal was blurring the line between reality/fiction. I can definitely appreciate the work that went into that goal. In fact, it was probably my favourite part of the game (lol). So yes, good stuff, devs. I do like some dark psych horror.  [b]Cons:[/b] I guess the jump scares but i mean...jump scares are jump scares. Not that you can find a lot of them like this, but I like jump scares that add to the experience. Ones that make sense to be there/ones that....have context? I don't know how to ask for classier jump scares lol.   The game could also be longer for those that want more out of their money but I think it was a fairly good play time. That said, I look forward to their future projects. Maybe they'll be longer and just as scary then lol.   [b]TL;DR[/b] It's a short, atmospheric, pretty unique romp into psych/horror.

I have played zero-caliber, onward, horseshoes hotdogs and hand grenades, Pavlov and others. While these are all amazing games that I have enjoyed very much. I really do feel like this takes it to another level. Just the graphics fidelity alone really sets it apart. However, more importantly I think the interaction with the guns and equipment and overall feel of scale is really game-changing. I used to think that maybe it was because of the controllers or because of the way VR is inherently so different from The real world and handling heavy objects like rifles. This doesn't seem to be the case though as when playing this game equipment feels heavier the physics are so good it actually really feels like you're firing these weapons. I found myself getting lost in this game, letting go of the fact that I'm in a VR headset and letting reflex simply take over. I'll admit zero caliber does this very well also, and although hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades is very accurate in the way you handle the weapons sometimes it can be frustrating to just getting to that state of flow where you are ejecting clips and reloading without even thinking. I'm happy to have found it and playing the other ones has given me lots of perspective but this is definitely the one. I hope that all of these FPS games sort of adopt this similar standard that contractors has. Like dedicating one trigger to either grabbing the receiver and having another trigger for grabbing the grip. While I love zero caliber sometimes it can be so frustrating when you're trying to grab the grip but you're just grabbing the receiver and vice versa. I also hope other games in VR follow this lead of graphics fidelity and optimization. This game actually runs better and looks better on my machine which is a 1070 i7 exedra then any of the other ones. Also having AI bots in death match is nice for casual offline play.

[h1]Graphics[/h1] This version of Chuckie Egg as you would imagine has fully updated graphics, new colour scheme but first thing you notice is the size of the graphics which are just too big and can\\'t be compared to the original and as they are large and the levels are no longer on a single screen which is counter productive but the screens do move quite nicely and the animations are fairly smooth and all characters from the original game have been recreated.  [h1]Sound[/h1] Pretty standard fare here, a new modern soundtrack which although sounds bouncy and has a casual feel about it really doesn\\'t fit the game at all and to be honest it will get on your nerves if you play the game for more than 10 minutes so you\\'ll end up muting it. Sound effects are very sparse and not many of them so in the original game you had quite a range such as walking or jumping but in this game it\\'s almost quiet so atmosphere isn\\'t great.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] Similar to the original but this is where the game falls flat on it face, speed is fine but jumps can be so annoying as they are very short, in the original you could actually have large jumps depending on how much you pulled the joystick but this version it\\'s just set and you end up dying because of it. Getting stuck on ladders and sometimes you can\\'t jump left or right but all gameplay from the original is there but jump is poorly implemented, sometimes there is no way out if a situation and you\\'ll die anyway. AI for most part is fine but predictable but sometimes it behaves very oddly, controls are very floaty and weak which isn\\'t good.  [h1]Features[/h1] Just basic featues and very limited options, does have high scrore etc but serves no real purpose as there are no steam leaderboards etc, presentation and intro is fine and does the job but don\\'t expect anything extensive here but there are some other modes other than single player campaign which you might enjoy.  [h1]Summary[/h1] This is a game of two halves really, on the one hand it has parts of the original game which will be familiar to those that know of Chuckie Egg but you feel that you are missing something. The basics of Chuckie Egg is here but execution is poor, looks ok but the colours are dull and the sound is just flat and annoying so no real incentive to play more than a few minutes at a time. Sound pains me because i\\'m a musician and it just doesn\\'t work in this game.  [h1]Rating[/h1] It pains me to see a modern version of a classic game just not working, wish the original levels were in the game in a retro mode but the dev doesn\\'t intend to do that which is disappointing. I\\'ve played both the original BBC and C64 quite extensively over the years but they are light years ahead of this entry so is there any hope for the future? This game is locked in it\\'s mobile roots so unlikely to change, this is my 1st negative review and not something i wanted to do but i have to be honest and say i consider this to be nothing more than imitation retro and very average.  I\\'ll give it only 4.5 out of 10 ten as a game in it\\'s own right but as a Chuckie Egg game it\\'s a mediocre 2.0 out of 10 \"sorry\"\\n', \"To the dev, please get this on KickStarter/IndieGogo.  As a proof of concept this game is already so fleshed out and plays great. A solid foundation for the upcoming updates. It is short like 40 minutes, you can replay it to unlock the abilities but I like to treat my early access games like demos as to not ruin the full experience.   Combat is a mix of Bulletstorm, Shadow Warrior and a bit of DMC. It is hectic and a lot of fun. You can see that the dev loves his Dark Souls as there is even an easter egg and the bosses are noticeably Souls inspired in terms of design and art.   Give this a try and support this guy.

However, I've played this game's original form before it came to steam, and I can't help but feel disappointed. There is a lot of content from the original that was cut out, and the story feels shorter than the original. I notice some missing sexual content scenes which were not included here. If you are new to the game of its existence, give it a try the story is really good.

Also, on smaller screens (like my laptop screen) the letters that fly by are unreadable.  If only there was an option to make all the text arial/calibri/impact/comic sans/....

Yes it has bugs and they need to be worked out but for all of it in general it is an amazing blacksmith shop game. If this was in an mmorpg for blacksmithing job class oh god that game would break WOW over its knee.  The way you have to heat up the ingot to the right tempature is great and once you get good enough you can just eye ball it bright yellowish gold to be sure.   the grinding is quick and easy so you can move on to something more fun the grinder does need to make the sword look sharper though.   the putting on the guard and hilt needs to be a little slower so we can get higher scores for though of us that are slow to respond.   the domasscus please add a window so we can see whats coming next its tetris with plates.   the magic is great in itself adds lots of money to your bank and much needs rep points. can we have more definition on some of the runes you like the blizzard what gem to place in the slot.   now for a bad bug that has made me start over a few times but its ok because i like starting over. theres one bug that if you accidently drop once part of the handle any of the parts ive had this happen on all 3 parts near the wall they clip though the wall getting lost to the void and there is no replacement for it. maybe allow us to buy replacement parts.\\n', 'Great game it really amaze.

You've just taken over as the leader of a band of mercs, just like Battle Brothers.  Otherwise this is quite a different game.

Which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether you like the extra complexity.

Fortunately for all of us, this summer we were taken by surprise as the devs announced a full blown DLC for our favourite game which just came out at the end of November. Here are my thoughts on the matter.  The New Stuff There are a couple new stuff that are more than welcome, from quality of life improvements to new enemies and a well done crafting system. Of course, we also got ourselves some new enemies, weapons and brutal boss fights. Although most of these things (especially the new retreat system and tryout mechanic) are more than welcome, some of these things could've had a little more thoughts applied to them. My main issue are with some new enemy gimmicks which at first, due to the novelty, are quite refreshing but in the long run, they become tedious and exhausting. You all get it? The Alps... Now that resolve and initiative are more important, I understand the need of fights driven by those but the design of this fight is simply not satisfying. At first, what seems like a good idea becomes extremely annoying after 2 or 3 encounters.   On the positive side, the other beasts and new boss fights are a lot of fun and represent a serious challenge on all stages of the game for new players and veterans alike. The new crafting system allowing us to pimp our gear, use new consumables and make powerful trinkets is a welcome addition, which in my humble opinion was very well done.  Guys... The Tutorial? One thing that remain unchanged and was a miss on the initial release is the lack of tutorial. Yes, trial and error is a good thing in a game, but when you're not explaining vital concepts such as Zones of Control and Over-the-shoulder shooting, you're creating frustration. On top of this, the roll log is a messy thing and represents a shore when you need to back track an action for that brother who just got downed in onr hit. I think the DLC was a missed opportunity on the devs side for fixing those 2 issues.  Overall, the DLC gives a fair amount of fun content for a very good price and for the hardcore fans, there's even a supporter edition which grants us a unique banner and matching shields. If you're already a fan of BB or stratrgy games like these, this is totally worth the money. If you didn't enjoy the game at first... It didn't change the core concept so don't bother.  Hope this help some of you ;-)\\n\", 'Best Dino Game!\\n', \"I think the game is not bad if you are 6 year old. This is the game to buy for your kids.

If you want to figure out the game for yourself, go to TL;DR at the bottom!  Let me start by saying that I still think this is a great game. Then lets establish some basic facts:  1. A standard turn has an allowance of 2 action points, unspent ones convert into Fate. 2. The Noble gives +1AP/turn for 12 Influence, with a 10% chance to end unless a further 12 Influence is spent on The Inquisitor. 3. A certain rare item and a certain starting operative give +2 free moves permanently, while a certain common item gives +2 free moves for one turn only. As the name inplies, these moves may only be spent on move actions (duh).  Having established this, lets get on with it:  MY PERSONAL JOURNEY  Having unlocked all stories, starting operatives and cults, I was very much looking forward to playing the game casually by experimenting with different combinations of the aforementioned parameters. After playing a few games, it quickly dawned on me how much I had relied on \"cheesy\" tactics to beat the game. Having the right starting operative for the job, and having prior knowledge of the cult and story decks, is a massive part of beating the game - perhaps too massive.  WORKER PLACEMENT  A big part of this game is making sure your operatives are standing where they can utilize their skills to harvest resources. To facilitate this, most operatives are recruited in locations where their skills are common in the corresponding adventure deck. In addition, scattered around the map are recruitable Townfolk that allow you to fast-travel to a preset location by spending an action point. When events conspire against you howerever, making a critical relocation can take the entirety of 1, 2 or even 3 turns.  THE AP SINKS  Your first starting operative, Virian Spellbinder, has the ability Contemplation of the Arcane that allows him or any other operative to spend 1 Lore and 1 AP to reduce corruption by 10. The game tells you that this, together with his tranquility, allows him to cast spells more often. This is simply not true. Contemplation of the Arcane has not been used by me a single time so far. By the time loosing 10 corruption seems like a good use for an action point, the game has almost certainly already been lost in all but name.  I could lengthen this already over-long review immensly by bringing up multiple examples of items, spells, and townfolk who fall into the same category, but my overarching point here is that there is a lot of content in this game that simply cannot compete for an action point. Especially because of...  CULTIST MOVEMENT AND THE TICKING CLOCK  Cultist spawn and cultist movement are governed by the story and cult decks. When a cultist movement card is drawn, all cultists get to move simultaneously. This is often a blessing in disguise however, as they will often leave their shrines and so reduce the rate of cult activity buildup. Cultists and cult shrines, like operatives, will continually effect the location they are in, spreading influence, increasing the rate of cult activity and threatening operatives with health damage and cult-specific debuffs. While cultist hunting is often a solid strat, the cult activity will always increase at a minimum of 1 per turn. Every time the meter fills completely the cult deck is replaced with a more powerful one, significantly reducing your chance to complete the main quest. Overinvesting AP into cultist hunting at the expense of pursuing the chapter objective is the bane of many runs.  THE STRENGTH OF RUSH STRATEGIES  Picking the operatives that can complete the Chapter objectives by spending the least amount of action points, wether through resource generation, free moves, or sheer iron dice power has so far proved to be the most effective strategy against all opponents. Each AP spent on cultist hunting is very often an AP that did not get spent towards the current Chapter objective. More importantly, cultist hunting only delays the failure state of the game, it does not prevent it. Working towards the final chapter goal is the only way to prevent the failure state, resulting in a victory. Having one socially skilled operative camping the Cathedral District while another hunts for cultist cloaks is a powerful strat but has a set-up time of several AP while leaving the cathedral camper exposed.  THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND THE DIFFICULTY OF COMEBACKS  This is the big one right here. At the end of the day, this is a game where a lot of dice are being rolled. A common game theory tells us that any increase in randomness favors the underdog. Other game mechanics conspire against this principle however. A status ailment being inflicted on a key operative, wether Exhausted, Mark of the Beast, or Cursed, will lessen your ability to complete further challanges, in turn suffering additional penalties. While your operatives are frantically spending precious AP trying to recover from this downward spiral, the Cultus Arcanum does not suffer from randomness: they steadily increase cult influence and activity each turn until a critical mass is achieved.  CONCLUSION  While I\\'ve had a great time playing this game and look forward to any upcoming dlc, I must confess I am a little disappointed in the lack of potential for casual play. Trying out suboptimal builds and getting stuck in a downward spiral where each turn lessens your chance of victory is simply not fun. Ideally, after a major setback it should be a dramatic and desperate race against time to beat the Cultus Arcanum on the finish line. The tightness of the AP economy sucks the probability and tension out of that scenario and make you feel like you are wasting your time.  I applaud the devs for their vision and bravery in designing a game like this to have a baseline of only 2 global action points per turn. But as I\\'ve explained at length now in this overly-long tirade, I do feel that a lot of potential gameplay falls by the wayside simply because of how massively precious AP is as a resource.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR  The core game mechanic just doesn\\'t work. I would still recommend this game to any fan of digital board games, especially those that enjoy a rouge-like challange of trial and error and figuring out optimal strategies. Just be aware that the returns drop noticably after unlocking everything. If you are a glutton for punishment however, trying to complete stories with suboptimal starting operatives will greatly increase the lifespan of this game for you.\\n', \"the gameplay is okay, but the map is way too small right now.

Tried game again ... ooooh, how much has changed! ... I dont have to jump off bear to shoot, I can shoot mounted; I like this very much. and between 2016 and 2019, loads of new dino's added. I'm totally hooked again.breeding program for the Kwisatz Haderach of Thylacoleo engaged, and cut way short of time required for the DireBears, coz now theres a thing called imprinting (much love again) ... sorry UberDireBear, but your not needed any more, granted you are faster, but this guy can straight-line from a to b even if there is a mountain in the way, and he swims real fast too .... I still love you M160 (Male born at lvl 160 DireBear, my previous uber pet) ... but I'm afraid Thylo F235 has taken over as primary mount (currently lvl 301 and still leveling) So now I'm on a new mission, went to Ragnarok with F235 to breed some T-Rexes (cos it's so easy to tranq a T-Rex if you can shoot from the saddle while running, this is great!), and have now started Rex breeding program on ragnarok .... M256 and F256 have now produced me A-Rex, B-Rex, C-Rex, through S-Rex (Ironically, stopped there, I dont need a T-Rex, 20'th spot reserved for a Yuty) ... have you guessed my plan yet? Mow trained up, I have 19 lvl 329 Rexes (primary stats health, stam and melee) and a 310 Yuty ..... most painfull mission yet was getting them back to the portal on Ragnarok to send them back to the Island ..... time to try taking on the bosses solo.

I'll start with the fact that my VR shooter expierence is limited. With that being said just over a hour in i feel the need to write this early review. This game to me nails the fun factor of a VR shooter that i never got from the likes of Arizona Sunshine, or more closely resembled Onward. Both of those other games are ok and all, but Contractors has takin things a step farther and really nailed the gun physics. The guns feel powerful in your hands. Its also the first game thats made me wanna invest the money in a gun stock, which i will be doing. Also from what i see the Devs are pretty dang active. They just rolled out a new patch this month and the small but growing community is embracing it. Just a few other notables the game has a training area where you can do drills and practice your aiming, or you can play offline against bots to get a feel for the maps before heading online. The graphics are crisp, the movements are smooth. I will recommend you have a wireless headset or suspended cables as moving is much easier just rotating 360 degrees, instead of the snap turn. Like i stated my VR shooter expierence is limited, but i feel this is a must own for any VR shooter enthusiast. Cant compare it to Pavlov as i havent played that.

The third, the ankylodocus, is alright. It just looks a little dorky.  The two new islands come complete with campaign missions.

Watched them switch from game development to DLC content. 1st red light Watched them claim the game is released. 2nd red light Watched the game get worse with dlc content adding to the mess that is the core game which in my opinion is not going to get any better support from wildcard.

Not at all disappointed, and I bought it at full price (along with the DLC). Definitely worth the initial asking price if you're interested in dabbling into the Rhythm Game genre, and with DLC it's slightly cheaper than the Switch release of the game, which to be perfectly honest I am contemplating picking up in the future to support the devs so we get more Rhythm games in the market.   Song selection is overall solid, difficulty variation between 4K/6K (4 Buttons/6 Buttons) are nice and balanced for newcomers and veterans alike, and controller support is there for those looking to play the game that way. I personally have been playing with the keyboard since it's a different experience from playing with the PS4 controller for DJMAX, but I will probably swap over to a proper DJMAX/Beatmania-style controller setup once I get one.   Do I recommend? Yes, most definitely. The initial asking price is really cheap, so you can test the waters out before determining if the rest of the content (provided via the Forever Friends DLC pack, which nets you all future song content as they come out via updates) is right for you.

She was level 311 and died to a level 40 Karkinos on the way back to the base because she did not attack back and just stood still.

And let me say, that these are actual hordes and good defense is a must-have since day one. Problem is... You need to keep an eye on food and gold at the start of the game.   You'll need food to keep surviving, so do not overpopulate the town from start... And you'll need gold to improve your city, 100 gold. So, strike the ground as soon as you can. You could also find food undroground sometimes... Such as rabbits or streams of water with fish in it. On surface your food sources are mostly farms. And once you hit the improvement, you get other interesting options. Like making farms on fully improved houses. So, yeah... There are plenty of options in this game to build a town that could make a stand and survive 13 days is quite possible. But it's going to be really hard.  Game has a really modest price, low sistem requirement, cute pixel graphics and high replayability. Every settler is unique... Sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst. And there is a quite challenging learning curve, so do not expect to complete the game on your first run. I do recommend it to everyone who is into tower-defense, 2d games and survival strategies.

Don't get me wrong, while the game *is* definitely worth its' price and certainly is overall good, I've found some of the gameplay mechanics and the whole narrative structure to be lacking in places.   First of all, combat should be reworked. You have guns, which is nice, and you should pretty much have enough ammo to kill all the killable enemies in the game, but why should you even use it? I beat the whole game pretty much just only using melee, because your health regenerates like Wolverine or a CoD protagonist, so basically enemy fights are kinda pointless since there's no tension, since you can just wait 20 seconds after knifing entire room of monsters, and you can regain 100% of your health, even if you're almost dead. My first instinct was to save ammo for boss battles, but turns out you can't actually damage them like that, you have to out-puzzle them, which is nice, but kinda drives home the point that combat system in this game, while is a positive addition, is ultimately pointless when you realize how you can cheese it. [b] How would I fix it? [/b] First of all, remove health regeneration, and maybe add a health restoration mechanic to save stations, or maybe rebalance the ammo and add a scooby snack medkit system, that way you'd actually be concerned with your health. Second of all, maybe make the bosses killable with firearms and physical damage, but it would require like 30 shotgun shells and 30 pistol rounds to kill him, some actual mini-boss battles would be appreciated.   The levels themselves feel a bit disjointed and lack a sense of cohesion and progression. You could interpret it as a introspection of a psychologically disturbed mind, or you could blame it on a lack of overall level design. One moment you're fighting eyeless hobo, next you're fighting giant cockroaches from fallout, the next you're literally playing against SCP-137 in a science lab, all the while having completely different tone and themes in the levels themselves. While this isn't really something that you think of during the game itself, but if you stop and think about it after completing the game, it does all kinda feel like a disjointed fever dream, and hey, if that's what the author was going for, they got it. Maybe this is an issue of a small production budget. Some NPC's and more segments from the 'real world' would flesh out the character and the world, but I guess it works for a small pixel-art horror game.   Also, as a side note, please don't lock the alternate game modes in option menus and behind weird gimmicks, most people probably won't unlock them by themselves, and it's not like they require any type of skill or craftyness, one quick escape to the 100% steam achievements guide can help you unlock all of them in a beat, so what's even the point of hiding them, other than to have most people miss the awesome music tracks for the car mode?    Overall, it's a very enjoyable and engaging game, and I'm looking forward for a more well-rounded experience from this Evil Akira guy.\\n\", 'Favorite VR Shooter! while the game is new and still in rough stages i cant wait to see what new stuff they put out! the game looks amazing and runs well. all the different customization options for classes and all the firefights and team work gives you time to mess with the guns and attachments to see what you like and learn to work with other team mates to take objectives and win games!\\n', 'difficult game which is rewarding when hitting tricks, the foundation is there and it is only in early access, hopefully becomes the skating game we havent got since skate and tony hawk\\n', 'Far from finished, but a lot of potential.

YEEEEEEHAW PIRATE REPUBLIC XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Total waste of money.\\n', 'The previous expansion made me stop playing the game. THIS ONE PULLED ME BACK IN, BABY!\\n', \"After a good amount of time playing the game i can say that:  It's awesome! You should get it for sure!  The story Might be short, But the features are insane, The graphics is quite good. By one dev. all of this..  Majestic.\\n\", \"This game has some of the cutest characters I've seen since Animal Crossing! The enjoyable style of this game doesn't stop with the character design either. The personality put into this game is very refreshing. From the socially awkward characters, to the cinematic cut away revealing a self inserted character breaking the fourth wall in the middle of a conversation among the characters dialouge, This game has more personality and charm than anything else the industry has offered since the release of Overwatch.   However, aside from the cute aesthetic of this game, I have some complaints about it. The creative potential that Grace Bruxner has demonstrated with this game only makes me frustrated that this game is so short and simple. If these characters weren't so static and the gameplay was more experimental, this could have easily been one of the most memorable indie games of 2018. I'm really looking forward to the next title in the series and hoping that Grace really allows her ideas to flesh out into a game with much more substance.\\n\", \"Honestly, I didn't realize from the stills and trailer how nauseating the static background was.  I wanted to get lost in this little game for an hour or so and barely made it 20 minutes.  I just couldn't look at the static sky for any longer (even just an option to make it solid.  PLEASE).  The aesthetic is SUPER fun and weird.  And I feel like there is a fun commentary on the overall subjective nature of grading and art making.  But there are definitely some gameplay mechanical issues I wish were different or explained more (such as interacting with the world, getting things graded and moving, which took me a second to even know I could move haha).  But I think as an idea, it's fun and weird.  Just not for my tired old eyes.\\n\", \"A highly enjoyable party-building JRPG with likable characters and, surprisingly, a pretty good story. However, I went into this game thinking it was going to be a cute and perhaps PG-13 at max waifu-collecting JRPG. I was very wrong. This game is INCREDIBLY graphically sexual. It didn't bother me but if you're expecting something mild, it is not this game. My only real complaint is the inclusion of lolis. I found the lolis incredibly creepy and would prefer if there was an alternative option for those of us who find it gross. Overall though, very good game.\\n\", \"Russia invaded one of my cities and i fought them off. I chased what was left of their wounded soldiers and they ended up retreating to a nearby city of theirs. I couldn't decide whether to commit to the chase and follow them into their territory so i ended my turn.  The next turn the river their city was on flooded and damaged the walls and all their soldiers that happened to be too close to it! Made conquering them easy. Built my own city where theirs once stood, but i added a dam :).  The disasters and climate change make the map feel alive 10/10   \\n\", \"Good little game, it has it's pros and cons, but it is worth the money for sure, specially with it's launch discount. Full review coming soon. One weird thing is that the game shows in your library as Colosio Run, instead of The Sky Climber, hopefully this will get addressed as it could confuse some players, but of course this doesn't affect the game experience.

I've played over 150 hours on the base game and this DLC has really helped make the game fresh and interesting again. Some nice touches include new and different contracts and encounters encountering a greater variety of enemies earlier on instead of just brigands. I already found a small hut of goblins and plundered some new equipment from them.  If you've played the base game and enjoyed I would say that the expansion DLC is definately worth it.\\n\", 'TL;DR It\\'s a good DLC, I guess. Just don\\'t expect having it and Space Race to let you become a super villain and hold the other colonies hostage with crazy terraforming tools turned superweapons.  The fun things: -Nuke the ice caps with 400 fuel. Apparently the fuel you make on Mars is military-grade nuclear material or something. -Fairly accurate portrayal of terraforming throughout the process. It\\'s slow, but Rome wasn\\'t built in a day and that sure wasn\\'t as complicated as reshaping an entire planet. -The world map is responsive to your actions: improve the atmosphere and clouds will start to appear. Add water before you raise the temperature enough and you\\'ll see ice form all over the surface. Turn Olympus Mons into an island. All sorts of fun things. -Cover your colony in lichen before you have liquid water. -Surprisingly, once you open the domes it seems that colonists will wander between nearby domes freely to use services near the edge of a neighboring dome. If you have a mod that extends the work range, this might be a nice little feature for you. -Grow plants outside and say goodbye to needing workers to make sure your colony doesn\\'t starve to death.  Now for the bad: -If you\\'re like me, you probably were hoping that the devs did something fun for colonies with a negative altitude on the world map and... They make a large circle around the colony on the world map always land. No joke, my first game was set in the lowlands with the hope there\\'d be some fun \"Martian Atlantis\" stuff to do, but even if you land at the lowest point on Mars and flood the entire planet, you\\'re still going to be above the water anyways. Kind of a let down. -Getting a nice amount of plant life around the colony. Unless you decide you only want to get one or two areas seeded with lichen early on, you really can\\'t get much done with a single farm or hydroponics farm. You need a lot of areas with high soil quality to grow crops in open farms and that\\'s a lot of maintenance for seeds. Every farm you have growing seed crops isn\\'t growing food. If you have the DLC that adds ranches, you can just raise livestock and not worry about it. -It doesn\\'t interact with Space Race in any way at all from what I\\'ve seen. The rival colonies have no real interest in terraforming the planet, leaving it up to you to do all the work. On top of that, there\\'s a bunch of fun things you\\'d think you could do with total control of the planet at your fingertips that you can\\'t. You can\\'t use magnetic field generators to trigger Marsquakes that hit other colonies. You can\\'t redirect comets or meteors to hit the Russian colony because they got a dome up before you and you\\'ve been waiting 60 sols to get revenge. You can\\'t even turn Mars into a 100% water world after everyone else opens the domes to wipe them out. This is a DLC where you\\'d think you\\'d be able to emulate a mad scientist, but... you just can\\'t. It\\'s sad, really.\\n', 'I want to start by saying that I liked the models of weapons and characters. Textures for such a price here are top, and the gameplay will not make you bored, I definitely recommend it, the price is juice!\\n', \"I've played this game for several hours and I haven't found the Nyakuza flair for the Ice Cap, other than that a great game\\n\", 'This game was cool and fun at first, but a lot of things ruined it. I had to set down the graphics because of the lag, even so, there is still some lag in the game. The game has crashed many times even with toned down graphics. There are also many glitches in the game. Also, the game play is too complicated. I wanted to play this in single player, but the survival exploration aspect makes this game too tedious and too time consuming. Too much inventory management, too much crafting, too much surviving. So much time can be spent taming a animal just for it to get lost or killed. More powerful animals can come out of no where and kill me without any chance for me to escape.  I hate it how i can easily run out of resources which means that i need to restart the whole game. I also hate that there are unfair ways to die, like for instance this one time i died because i accidentally ate some poisonous thing. Too many bad decisions like upgrading the wrong skills, using resources unwisely, going to a dangerous territory unprepared, forgetting to carry certain things, losing things, getting lost, and losing rare items. Without respawn, the game would be totally unfair, but in a survival game there shouldnt even be any respawning, yet the survival conditions in this game are too realistic even though respawning contradicts all that. I dont like it how the game actually expects me to play on multiplayer, but what about first learning how to play the game first in single player? Too many annoying people in multiplayer. The game is just too difficult, time consuming, and buggy.\\n', \"I actually refunded this one in feb. Gave it another shot after 10th update. It sucked at release, but now it is actually good. Big thumbs up to the devs. Game developers who actually follow their words with actions and don't abandon their game after release - now that's a rare sight nowadays.
