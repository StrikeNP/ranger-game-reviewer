I've heard a lot of hype surrounding ARK and was really keen and excited to try it. I was pretty much let down. The game seems like a husk compared to the community and craze it had when it wasn't even fully released, it seemed a lot more fun. The game seems way too grindy and sadly, for a game that had such promise has just vanished into that category for me. I will probably try to play more of it to see if I'll be proven wrong in the future.
dont buy hella buggy
jew
i have played a ton of ark. really good game. but for some reason i cant play anymore. it wont start, and if it does it crashes when i try to play. and its not worth the money anymore.. without crashes 8/10. with crashes 1/10.
ABSOLUTE BAG OF DOG SICK. I WOULD RATHER MICHAEL J FOX GIVE ME A LOBOTOMY.
Poorly optimized, Very unfriendly to new players, abusive devs and much more. Stay away from this game.
The game can be fun but it just does not compare to the fun I have on Conan Exiles. In Conan I can enjoy my time far more than I ever can on Ark. Not to add that Ark does not offer as much re-play value. Once you get to the max gear and items the game begins to feel empty and boring. And with the massive amounts of money they are wanting for the main game and dlc, it is just not worth it.
shit game
This is why we can't have nice things. 4/10
Was good in 2016 now it is actual trash
Boring, rust is better ;)
I just bought the game and It took forever to install but most games like this take a long time to install. however I got on the game to play an it was VERY laggy and I have don't know what settings should be so that will stop. It froze up and now its saying it needs to be downloaded again, which will take another 3 hours, can anyone help?
Frequent crashes, bugs that haven't been fixed since early access days, the game is unstable as all hell, hit detection and lag compensation is absolute garbage (you will hit your target, arrows will be sticking out of it, but it's not registered server side, even on low ping servers). There's no way I can recommend this game, the devs clearly have no incentive to fix it and only drop feed minor fixes while the game breaking ones stay unchanged.
Literal garbage.  Poorly optimized, bad visuals, choppy gameplay.  This ignores of course the weird pay scheme, with expansions coming before the actual retail release.
I have had this game for a very long time, and for most of it's life despite its general bugs and optimization issues would recommend it. However, with the game being "finished" now and all the dlc, updates, ect. finished other than some reacuring holiday events and "bug fixes" that don't fix anything. To make matters worse if people do report others for breaking rules or exploiting bugs good luck actually getting the company's attention. The dev's went from being open and communicating to ignoring the players all together. The final straw for me is when the dev's ban a large youtuber known for playing and promoting the game for FREE is globally banned for making a video not showing HOW t odo these exploits but trying to draw attention to them so the dev's could fix them, exploits that had exited for literal years by the way. All in all i truly wish i could recomend this game but as is i think they game is past the point of no return now. There are other dinosaur games that just do it better. If you want a dinosaur game and to support the developers go try The Isle, its nowhere near finished but FAR more promising than ark ever was.
This game has more bugs and faults than any other game I've ever played.
the game use to be able to play on my computer now it says it wont
buy it but is  say I didnt
Spawned INSIDE a cage several times. Someone set up a cage to catch new players for whatever reason I didn't stick around to find out. Tried a different server....same thing. No thanks......no thanks
im pretty sad about the game tbh game could be much better if they put more work to it i keep getting my game crashed and i've seen others with the same problem as me and the developers still hasnt fixed the issue yet
Buggy f***in mess. Just an utter s***show. At least you can make your character matte black and wider than the Space Shuttle Challenger. Just like the challenger, this garbage sucks from the get go.
don't buy this game if you have no friend to play with.
This Game is Bugie and Glichy.
Bought this game for $60 downloaded/installed trying to join any server it keeps glitching and dropping out back to main menu. What a waist of money !
The moment I pressed the install button, it told me that it would be 112Gb of installation, then I pressed next and it turned out to be 26Gb. This is a clear bait.   I feel betrayed.
This game is garbage dont buy this. Maybe if you can play through 329874509237845 years of unfun gameplay to have some fun which can be done in other games without this shitty grind then by all means do it.
Fun, but still a buggy unpolished mess
This game is really un-optimized to the point where my average fps is 20. I also face the problem of higher lvl dinoes at spawn. This is a problem because there is almost no way to take them out.
soooper lag 
Great concept and really fun game, that is until you inevitably get griefed by level 200 Gigo tames and alpha tribes who have nothing better to do and have no need to grief you when theyre past the thatch and stone stage. Could've been a great game if the devs didnt ignore the griefing problem for years, and thats the exact reason this game died.
I have left a review for this game a fair while ago. If you are thinking of buying this game then I have one word for you DONT.  I had Ark from the very beginning (on another account) and I am very disappointed that the developers have done very little to fix the fundamental problems that have plagued this game from the very beginning. Don’t get me wrong the premise and what they have done in terms of content etc is very, very good. The problem is its buggy as hell. I cannot get through a game without a crash, and this has been over 3 different computing systems. Yes, there are work around's but eventually there are issues with those as well.  Do yourself a favour if you haven't brought Ark yet, save your money, for the grief that the bugs, glitches etc give you it just isn't worth it. 
This game runs poorly on Mac.
Bought this when it first came out. Rubber banding issues galore. It has never been fixed, it is a consistent issue with this game since release and it appears that there hasn't been any progress in remedying this. While the premise of this is cool as hell and I wanna play it and enjoy, it is not possible. I sincerely regret ever purchasing this game and I wish there was a way to receive a refund after waiting for a broken game to be fixed.    The developers for this game will get added to the ever growing list of folks that I will never purchase a product from again.
Not sure who in the right mind thinks this is worth $50, official is not playable because the developers cannot fix issues that compromise the integrity of the game since day 1. Unofficial is nice but is not worth full retail, Maybe if the game goes on sale for 90% off then a possible pickup.
Terrible Game overpriced and not fun at all
It’s astonishing how poorly optimized this game remains.   I would say it has potential, but the studio has left it in the dust to create another half-baked game (Atlas).    
it is a good game but filled with bugs i cant even play it anymore because of how buggy it is ive spent like £60 
Recommended : Not actually  Why ?  - 111 USD (full bundle) to get tons of bug -  game abusively called "release" : it's just pre-release no more - pain to play gameplay - very bad building system : it take many hours to build something and expand - fail pathfinding from dino (blocked on trees, around doors) - no map terraforming - no matter your level you'll get ass kicked by dino - fake easy starting position : game severely unbanlanced, you can be destroyed anywhere - money maker devs "Pay, Play and Shut up" : they ignore players,  many dlc, now pvp and always tons of bugs since many years never solved.   The only thing that save this "Titanic" game to shrink is tons of settings when you create your own server. Outside that, this game is ruined by bugs.  When devs will decide to offer us better job, i'll update this review. Don't listen bad reviews who sell you dreams about Ark saying is "best of all time".  I spent 43 USD to buy it and it worth in real only 10.  That's all, run you fools.
no
Zero effort with maximum DLC micro-transactions. Seems to be inspired by EA, Activision or Robert Space Industries. The last one is the most appropriate comparison to Ark.  Let Epic have this one, it's like their store so it should blend in perfectly.
Not gonna lie, my experience with ark has been several years old now. It's one of the best if not the best type of survival game i have ever saw and played. Although i dont recommend it... for the simple yet unbelievable fact that there are loads of errors/crashes and bugs on the game, that are not hardware related.   The way the game was made was the problem and the lack of care from the developers its very, very wrong. I have seen ARK youtube content creators getting banned from the GAME!!! for just pointing out those bugs. Now what type of dev's do that to their own clients and community???   I have myself experienced several bugs, which were not relatable to my hardware nor software as far as i have searched... and this happens from low end PC's to high end without hard proof of what's the problem.  Making things clear now:  Is the game fun? Yes, tons! You do have to spen loads of money for careless and disrespectull dev's/company that doesnt seem to care about the problems in the game and just cares about making u spend all ur money on the game and DLC's.  The game doesnt run on the best type of software that other games of the same age already run, so you will expirience what usually ppl call ark, "the machine killer". Cuz thats rlly what it is, its fun, but its a machine/wallet killer with shaddy dev's behind it!  If u bought, have fun while u can, if u didn't dont!
Boring grind. Get on Rust much better survival game.
no. just no
I don't see why someone would ever release something so unfinished.
Meh nothing amazing.
While the game starts off as a survival game with a very rich dangerous world, it quickly turns into something.. else....  Once you have established an army of dinos, its no longer survival the challenge is gone food is not longer a problem. Danger is no longer a problem since you can ride a flying dino to your destination, or take a T-rex or some other powerful strong dinosaur. Food and water are easy to acquire with killing selected dinos or hunting wild. A survival game should remains survival all the way through to the end and never give the player means to make all the required necessities right outside their front door. Once you have an argentavis or any large carnivore the games only real threat is bosses and drakes and drakes only appear on certain maps... there are few real threats. and its disappointing.. cause the game is crafted so well for survival, although it remains a fun game its not what I was looking for and cause they so heavily market it as a survival game thats why I dont recommended this game..
Good concept, terrible execution.
This Game is fun but due to the amount of bugs and the little amount of enforcment of the rules i would say this game is not worth it
I have 8700k
Wheres my goddam reaper king with all my things in it, this update ruined all of us
abandoned by devs
ima keep this short. The developers DO NOT care about this game they have been refusing to fix major bugs sense launch. Ark could be so much more. so much better. But the devs abandoned it right after the final dlc launched and are now "busy" making a sea of theives clone called Atlas.
Hey! I have over 1200 hours in this game but for some reason it now wont let me launch the game. It says its updating and is stuck on 0/0 bytes, not blaming this on ark or its developers more on steam and just hoping someone will reach out and help me fix this problem.
Just play Minecraft
The world is amazing, but the grind in unbearable.  Single Player: needs to be played with exp and resource multipliers or else you spend hours getting nowhere. Then it gets lonely and boring without objectives that a lone player can accomplish.  Online Multiplayer: is a shit show of who can waste more time grinding exp and resources. You spend 20hrs grinding resources building a base, taming dinos, leveling up. Log off for 30 mins, log back on, and your entire base has been wiped from the island by some super tribe with unlimited explosives and max level dinos. Rinse and repeat. There are no head to head battles just one sided offline raids.  Private Server: This is the only place the game shines, if you can convince 3-10 friends who all have hours of free time, a very powerful PC, a copy of Ark to play with you then you're in for a great time. The game is a rich survival experience with some challenging endgame missions to strive for. Its a living breathing world full of tense moments, challenges and exciting exploration. Just make sure you have tamespeed/experience/resource multipliers to get past the excessive grinding required for progression.  I'd say surface level it looks like it's worth $40, but after you realize it's just a grindy frustration simulator you realize it's only worth about $10-15 worth of quality entertainment before you want to put it down and forget you own it.
This is a great game. On console, at least. I recently bought Ark on my PC after playing on my Xbox for about a year. I was disappointed to know that the game doesn't even work. I try to join servers and it loads for hours until it finally crashes. This has been brought to Ark's attention long ago, but they haven't taken any steps in fixing it. Very Disappointed.
THIS IS BULLSHIT I CANT PLAY ON A DAMN SERVER BECAUSE I CLICKED WRONG SERVER INSTALLED MODS AND NOW I CANNOT JOIN ANY SERVERS 
Don't believe this works in anything but windows. I don't care what the lying store page says. This company if full of it and I am tired of software that makes claims and leaves its customers high and dry.  Don't waste your money or your time. You are just a number.
I will never buy a wildcard game again. Dont get me wrong, the game is great, and so much fun, and I've spent more time playing it than Id care to admit on PS4 and PC. But oh my god I have never ever encountered so many buggs and crashes and annoyances that make the game unplayable.  The amount of googling I've done just to try to get the game to work after Ive sunk hours and hours and tons of emotional investment is absurd. Wildcard does nothing to help, they don't even pretend to care.  Look, take out the new dinos and events and all the cool awesome stuff Wildcard has done, and just make the game PLAYABLE. SUPPORT THE GAME for the people who have bought it. It really sucks for a company to care so little about allowing people who have bought their game (I've actually bought it twice, lol) to actually play it. Game is 5/5, company is 0/5. And there are thousands of awesome games out there, but companies who don't care if you can play their game are rare.
The Buggiest game I've ever played! tried it when it was first released. there were a lot of bugs and crazy stuff could  happen. decided to give it another try now. well I sincerely regret it. Imagine playing carefully for over a few hours, collecting good loot, getting a first pet and then... BOOM you get stopped by the invisible wall while running away from a dinosaur and you are dead. Overall, tones of invisible walls, enemies which glitch through walls (can bight you through them or just walk into your base as if there wasn't a wall at all). And there are a lot more. but these ones are the most common. I definetly not recommend getting this game, unless you don't care about bugs.
this game is seriously the embodyment of cancer
It's a good concept, but it doesn't work.
The price is way too high, and the soundtack is so hyped compared to the game, that it just sounds stupid. To make ARK "fun" you have to install alot of mods, and then I just loose patience. The game should be fun at the beginning, so you don't have to install that many mods. I also can't connect to my friend, and he said that I'd have to wait around 2 hours before I could connect again. 2 hours! By that time I have to eat dinner, and after dinner I can't play anymore. That is the rest of the weekend wasted, waiting for ARK to let me join. I don't think ARK is worth 60 euros.
This game concept is incredible. Honestly, you will not find something more original and fun/competitive/difficult on steam. However, you will also not find any devs more incompetent than Wildcard. Unreal engine and blueprints has paved the way for non-software engineers to "program" and it shows. 10/10 great concept, -1/10 terrible code.
no
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THEIR ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING ME WHO CANNOT LAUNCH THE GAME
Far too buggy to be playable, developers are trash, never fix anything. Server admins will use cheats and exploits against you, even on official servers. Over all just a terrible game with too much grinding, and far too many bugs.
One of the more ambitious, but most disappointing and frustrating games I ever played. It's not only frustrating because of incredibly unbalanced gameplay (example: the abundance of therizinosaurus, which are similar to rexes in starting areas) but most important because of game breaking glitches and issues the developers refuse to adress. My last session ended after taming and mounting a raptor after getting off of him again, he ran off like crazy, with all my other tames following him. They ran into one of the many therizinos and were attacked. All of my dinos were killed and I was not able to do anything. I cannot overlook issues like these in a survival game, therefore a bad rating from me. Content wise, the game has much to offer, but the gameplay can be a chore. The game doesn't respect your time in the slightest if you play on official servers. And bugs/glitches make the game a frustrating mess.  I followed the games progress since the early access days, by the way...  THERE IS FUN TO FIND IN THIS GAME, theres no doubt about it, but it is an unpolished mess and it looks like this game was designed by some feature creeps, packing the game with more and more content, without even thinking about fixing critical issues that emerge from following their shameless ambitions...  Keep these points in mind if you plan on buying this game.
survival evolved 5/10 meh it had potential.... survival of the fittest 1/10 another worthless MOSA from a useless genre... it was forced on me... i think they call that rape ;P
Trash game. Used to be fun. Community is toxic
Really don't recommend this game. Its bugged and is lagging everytime.   1/10 won't let dodo's fuck eachother ever again
I really enjoy this game when it works. WHEN IT WORKS. The biggest issue is with the game suddenly becoming unstable and not running when I try to load into a saved game. Its a huge let down when the hours you put into a game have to be tossed into the garbage when the game decides to just refuse to work UNTIL you delete your saved game. This has happened to me multiple times across multiple versions of the game.  This game is just rage bait. DO NOT BUY!
Had nothing but constant problems with this game. The game is awful without mods and everything about playing with friends is tedious and broken. From what I remember I had to install a bunch of mods that would only install when the game was open, but the game being open would lag the download and the progress bar for installs would constantly glitch out and not show what it was actually installing. From the little bit of my hours on this game I actually spent playing the game, I can say it runs decently once you're actually loaded into a game. Overall it was not worth the hassle to setup and I still experienced constant problems connecting to friend's servers which would require them to rehost which would take forever and hosting a server required an even beefier computer to handle. The game is nowhere near worth $60 and I think the sale price of $20 was still not worth it. You're much better off spending your money on anything else.
if you play this game you suck big girthy little boy cock. If you play this game you are 100 percent a pedophile and you like them young and hairless naked little boys and girls.  P.S: pedophilia is kinda hot so hit me up ;)
I play this game since Alpha, and those who made this took a great concept and.... well, they took a great concept and over the years made an at least acceptable game. The alpha was really buggy, it still isn't well programmed and the servers are too weak. It's not really finished, but it also won't be updated anymore except for new DLC's.  I love dinosaurs, I had a bit of fun despite the awful community and the Chinese Clans that serverhop and destroy anything, but I can't recommend this. Not for 60 Euros. I paid 28 Euros in the Alpha, and looking at how much I played it it might have been worth it. But this game shouldn't be 60 Euros, not the way it is.
idk just isnt enjoyable
Awful
Before you set out Code of Conduct. Fix the bugs and server status first. You do not deserve to ask the users for anything unless you do not appreciate the players time they spend in this game.
To be honest,it's a group of orphans in this studio.
fix meshing and aim bot. Also respect people who created the content for your game (H.O.D). honestly, this is good game to play but the errors and lack of responsibility from wildcard team are ruining this. Hope you can understand and solve this problem soon
It's time for Wild Card and Snail games to take some accountability. This game would be great, if not for the game breaking meshing issues that have gone on for years. Instead of fixing it they seek to kick people off there game and use censorship tactics. They are under fire for it now as well they should be! This game is a 0! ZERO, that's right! That's how much you spend on it! WC and Snail are two peas in a pod. Ripping off there customers with shovel ware. The future of video games is very bleak indeed. Now that these jerks can just release unfinished garbage and make a fortune. Not I. I'll quit buying. They can all go to hell for all I care. Remember. $0.00 is how much this game is worth. Till they fix it. Which will be a cold day in Hell...
if you look up the word unoptimized, you'd find a picture of ark
This GAME is TRASH but FUN time to time WITH FRIENDS  Its not worthed full price. your getting raped not playing with friends and official is pay to win. 90% of all unofficial servers are dead.  DONT BUY SCORCHED ITS ACTUAL ASS Scorched earth earth is the most useless map because you can play on ragnarok for free with the same dinos and if you want to have  a desert challenge ragnarok is like 1/3 desert. Ragnarok even has griffins.  Combat  The combat is fucking horrible because a lot of hits don't register even though you see blood on the person or dinosaur. Reloading any weapon is fucking terrible if you shoot any weapon (This problem occurs more with single shot weapons like a (cross)bow or longneck.) It shoots, the arrow or bullet reloads it but you can't shoot or it doesn't even reload at all! You have to reequip the weapon and by that time your probably already raped by the thing you attacked.   Graphics The graphics are great but it takes a lot it to run. Other games with the same grapics run better with lower specs its redicilous.  the pay2win aspect In official people buy dinos and tools and armor that are bat shit op or aren't available in that map like wyverns or drakes etc. your name it. You buy em on facebook or something a guy joins a server, gives the egg and there you go a wyvern for 10+ bucks.  This game is dog shit I'm glad i bought it in the beta for like 15 bucks.
This is the perfect type of game that will kill you, make you crash, and then your body expires before you can log back in. This game's servers and connection stability is absolutely terrible. It ruins the entire game.
I like ark and i think its a good game, but honestly its too much of a grind.
Mesh: Cheating involved

Big NoNo Get Rust :D
Its a fun game, but riddled with game-breaking bugs that cause all sorts of freakin' headaches.  EDIT: So, after a F'king month of a few friends and I playing on our own server, it's just all erased, for no motherF'king reason. At all. I understand if we were playing on an online server where people are d*cks and just wipe people for fun, but this was a private non-dedicate server. Just erased, with no trace of anything.
After a fair amount of time playing this game I can say,  when it's running good,  with no bugs,  and not crashing every fifteen minutes... it's quite fun.  But the problem lies with all of the issues I've mentioned. Still extremely buggy. Still crashes all the time.  The only reason I've decided to leave this review now is because after almost two years of not playing I decided to start  up a server and play with some friends again, but I can't keep the game open for more than a minute on the menu without it crashing. If you are willing to deal with all of the bad, the game can be fun. But I would not recommend it, as you'll waste far more time keeping the game running than you will playing.
YOU GET RAIDED REALLY FAST BY THE  PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLAYING HERE LONGER DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY FIX IT
dont recomend on mac the grafic have to be set to low and game crash alot it overheats my computer and takes 20 mins to load 1 into 1 game
i dont like this game because it just nonstop crashes all the time when i try to load into a server. but if someone knows hot to fix it ill start to like it again 
I have no idea why i spent so many hours in it. But it's wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle. I wish i could get back my time and money i spent in the game. I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone in it's stat
pay to win
I want my money back I just played 1 hour more than refund limitation. fuck I hate this game so much
I got this game half price so I'm lucky for that, it's fun but it feels like minecraft with an expensive mod
no
Do one thing and this game becomes amazing. Provide an option to remove alphas. In single player mode it is near impossible to kill these things unless you have at 100+ hours, and even then its difficult. Not fun watching one unluckily spawned alpha destroy everything you've done. 0/10
can i join any on in ark guys please  in a offical server
zor
BUG LAG. . . wtf when you get kicked out of the game. you relog dead. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH WASTE OF MONEY. I've never always done review but this one is annoying.
10/10  Greate game!
trash game trash developers booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
dont play this shit its chunk of error this game is all good but error is ruinde this error reset my level hnasdjkeriuyj hgafsdlhi
ark fix your game cause its fucking garbage like you have been up for 8 years now and still its liek this seriously kill yourselves you fucking useless ass devs fucking dont know how to make a game yours truly fuckurself 
I played it a bit.
Not to say I didn't get my moneys, worth out of the game, I've been here since the beginning when it was just ARK. the Devs quit listening to the players. It started out as small changes then lead to be entire re works. no flyer speed, all the way to kibble rework. now with extinction a tribe can be way over powered. but what do I know, I've only played 3k plus hours. fun concept its just morphed into something else. only reason I get on now is for ten minutes at a time to feed rotten meat to sleeping atlanteans that has washed onto the shore.
This shit trash yo
terrible overall performance, will be going for a refund.
Your game is going to die if you keep trying to gouge us for money every time a new dlc is realed. just implement it into the original map and game!!?! why split up the player base like this ?!?!? get your **** together.
Bad Game, While i am play and upload item in tek transmitter and the server down. all my mine is gone
Not to on optimizing the game instead of trying to pump out more dlc, not fucking clue what they were think adding cages and handcuffs to the game, no shit people are gonna just grief with them, worst part is that shit has been in the game for like 3 years now
I played this game a fair bit, on various servers, unofficial and official. If you've got your heart set on playing it, play on x5 all times at least, otherwise grinding is unbearable. Official servers are unplayable because of literal 3 hour tames and your base being wiped by some guy with c4 when you finally go to sleep after watching a lvl 80 bird tame for 2.5 hours... The game feels like the devs sat down and said how can we make this game dumb and not fun. And thus Trodons, micro-raptors that knock you off the back of your FLYING MOUNT, bugs, ground shaking lvl 250 brontos and freaking cake eating snails were made. To sum up some stuff up I'll just throw down this.  Graphics: ☐ I can see every polygon ☐ Really bad ☐ Fine ☑ Beautiful ☐ Masterpiece  Price/quality: ☐ Full price ☐ Wait for sale ☐ Fair Price ☑ Don't do it. I know you like guns. I know you like dinosaurs. But don't do it.  Computer needs: ☐ 90' PC ☐ Minimum ☐ Medium ☐ High end ☑ NASA computer (if you want your fort to load in before you crash into the wall)  Bugs: ☐ Atlas ☑ I mean, it's Ark... ☐ Lot of bugs ☐ Once in a blue moon  All in all, if you're on a unofficial server with x5 times or more, with a bunch of friends, and lots of other tribes to fight, and offline c4 and rocket blockers, you can have fun for a time, but eventually you realize, this isn't making me happy, half the time I'm mindlessly grinding, and the other time I'm frustrated and angry. I turn my brain off and mindless work AT WORK. And I'm frustrated and angry when I interact in a social interaction with another human in real life. I play games to unwind and have fun. If it's not fun, it's a bad game.
Game crash LowerLevelFatalError within 5 to 30 minutes. Searched for a fix only to find this issue has been around for many years. 17 hours gameplay on record, never made it past skill level 6 due to game crashes.
no
fix the bugs and i give it good review
Before you download this game or ANY game that uses "alleged" anti-cheat software like spy software like Battleye, do a search on what battleye does and you will see they scan your entire harddrive to "look for cheat software."  BS, they are uploading content from your hard drives to their servers.  (https://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/2750n0/battleye_is_sending_files_from_your_hard_drive_to)  After running an audit of uploaded content through my PFsense firewall, I confirmed that data in no way related to Ark was being uploaded.  Ark forces this program to be downloaded and run as a service on your PC now.  Regardless of how many times I have deleted this program and related files, it shows right back up after I restarted Ark.    I was a huge fan of this game, right up until I began investigating what Battleye was actually doing.  Thankfully I have a dedicated gaming PC and didn't use my work pc for any content like this.  Shame on you Wildcard!!!
Bought this when I had a crappy laptop, knew I couldnt run it but still waited for the day I had a good PC.  That day has finally arrived and I am....disappointed.  First when loading into the game, the music is super loud (thank god I wasnt wearing headphones) and is minimized and windowed.  I turn down the music and make the game full screen, go to find a server to play on, I try to join a PvE one and need to restart the game for some sort of add on. I say fine and do so. Also there's only about maybe 5 official servers with an acceptable ping for where I live.  Upon joining back into the game, the server I wanted to play on is no longer there, and there are only 3 officials servers left for me to join, the best has a ping of around 110.   I join the server anyway and see that its taking an extreme amount of time to load the map so I say "screw it some other time" thinking that its because the map is maybe old and filled with played owned creations and stuff. Try and tab out and nothing, try and alt+f4 nothing, try and open task manager but it wont come up because the loading screen blocks everything and I put the game into full screen so I cant get past it. Eventually I shut down the PC and quickly hit cancel to force the game to close.   Now 5 minutes later im writing this review, and a minute after im done posting it I will likely be uninstalling it. I was hyped up for a good experience playing it with my brand new PC and this is what happened, atleast with my fragmented hard drive on my old laptop I would expect this stuff - now im using a high end gaming rig fit for 2018-2019 and it defaults to medium settings even though the game came out years ago. Big sad.
Its not worth playing 3/10
This game is the most un optimized game that has ever set foot on my computer. So many problems not fixed that i had to do manually. The game itself is fun and enjoyable but when i wanted to play it after som time, it crashed my computer atleast 4 times while playing. Fix your goddamn game. BTW i have a pretty good rig and is horse lenght over the recommended system requirements. Sorry for grammar
Runs like ass! takes way too much time to do anything! Combat is really horrible!
This game.....don't buy this game if you haven't been playing since "early access".....You will regret it and waste your life. This game was created for trolls only. If you weren't in on the ground floor....You are fucked for life. Heed my warning or not, fuck you bitch
Game is great when playing with friends.... WHEN IT WORKS! I got to join friends who are all playing together and whenever I click join game nothing happens at all... or if something occurs it says connection timed out.  What is the point of a game where you get to play with friends if you don't get to play with friends!!
Rediculously horrible, if you have an issue and you contact a gm(administrator) they dont do shit. game breaking glitches such as meshing, and more 
Game is fun. However, their priorities aren't good. They add more buggy shit instead of improving the base game/bugs problems etc. you'll just get stuck in a dino or something dumb.
This game is just so poorly programmed and I really hate all the menus and stuff it just doesn't work great. I am pretty mad that they released it for 60 euros so DONT BUY IT!
Bugs, Glitches and Crashes: Cancer Evolved
Well, there is building. . .dinosaurs. . .eh. . .yeah, that's really it.  The graphics are semi pretty.  The game play is a bit rigid and cumbersome. Honestly, I got bored with this game really fast. Unlike games such as 7 days to die and conan exiles, this one just didn't have that catchy grab and play to it. It's just dull. There's no real story line, and I assume the goal is to tame dinosaurs and survive while building a base and not getting trolled/killed repeatedly by other players. It's just not my idea of a fun time in this game. I would compare it to rust, a world full of pvp trolls and nothing interesting what so ever.
For a game with such a large amount of open world. there is oddly very little to do. and the DLC is all things that should have been put in the origonal game as updates, not DPCs . just a greedy dev tryn to squeeze every peny out of you they can, b4 you realise what a shallow empty game you wasted money on.  i spent so much time trying to give this steaming pile of dino deficate a chance, i probably blew my refund window :-(   TLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH      PS: to the steam team. 2 hours is entirely insufficient to attempt to find value in such a large game. i will no longer be purchasing ANYTHING through steam. thx for your willingness to bend customers over and thoroughly sodomise them without remorse,.
good game when they want it to be.
Runs terribly on mac. Bootcamp and run it on windows. I litterally can double the graphics on windows using the same machine.
every update more and more bugs ... dont waste money
I can't recommend this to anyone in its current state. The vanilla game is unplayable for me due to the state of balancing. Maybe if you have a 24 person tribe it'll be better. The game used to be very fun and it was cool to explore and see things, but you can't do anything, especially on the dlcs, without being harassed by animals that you stand no chance against, especially at low levels.  Imagine being attacked by a pack of 5  big animals that can slow you down to the point where you pretty much can't go anywhere.    That was pretty bad, but then I decided to go back to The Island, which is the first map. Figured it wouldn't be as bad, surely they couldn't have messed it up further than it was last time I played it with alphas (animals that can pretty much instantly kill you and any of your tames that aren't ridiculously tanky) and the dinosaurs that can almost instantly put you to sleep and actively hunt humans in packs, which are also small, making them more difficult to see/hit.  Well, the game always had raptors at the start which would sometimes be a challenge but not undoable after a few levels. Now they can jump at you from far away and pin you down, meaning you can't attack or move at all (also this happens when you're mounted) so you just die.   Poor balancing and mechanics messed this game up.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The world, especially the DLC worlds look amazing, but fighting enemies that are bullet sponges that can kill you with everything except the strongest armor in the game isn't fun. Power creep is too real of an issue here.   I simply cannot recommend it to anyone, not even people who have friends that are willing to play it with them. Unless you severely change settings (which can be done, timers, resource gain, damage, health, etc, though still makes the game really weird in some places because the settings don't pertain to specific animals, it affects all of them so you could change the timer for taming a brontosaurus from 4 hours to 1 hour but it would make smaller animals tame instnatly), mod the game (easy enough to do with the workshop), and change the mechanics (impossible) to make it so that you don't get killed because of poor game design. Sure, some of the mechanics worked fine before because you could avoid torpor with certain types of items if you were prepared.   Now it's just tank it while spamming left click until either you die or they die. The combat is extremely lack luster and involves left click and w, unless you have a shield, in which case it involves S and right click too.  Don't buy it just because of the videos and screenshots. Yes, the game almost looks as good as that if you have 6+ GB of vRAM and assuming your other specs are amazing too, but most people can't run the game on high. That being said what'll happen is you'll start to enjoy the world  and want to play it more only to be hit by roadblock after roadblock. The game was like this initially, but you get past it and can enjoy more and more of what the game has to offer. Now there are too many cheap mechanics, enemies that do too much damage and tank everything you have unless you have a horde of dinosaurs tamed, and the timers for stuff is ridiculous, causing the game to be too easy in some parts and harder than it has to be in some parts, so you'll find yourself exiting and going back to the main menu a lot to change settings.   Especially when you want to build that gun that costs 95  metal ingots (not an exaggeration, the smithy has a conversion rate of 2 unprocessed metal to 1 ingot as well) only to realize that the bullets cost 1 ingot to make each. Yeah, this game's balancing is abhorrent in every way conceivable.  Unless you're unemployed and aren't going through school you won't have time to build up your base AND protect it in vanilla online servers.  tldr Wildcard is incompetent and doesn't know the meaning of fun and created a game that was  cool but then gradually ruined it
this game sucks, i cant even get into within an hour 
I downloaded this game and everything was laggy, I inmediately spawned with the most OP dinosaurs in the game and got killed instantly. and that happened every single time again and again. It's the worst game I've ever seen in my entire life.
i redownloaded this game after 3 years, i looked at youtube videos and thought the game looked far better then it did before full release, i loaded into the game and i was instantly struck with lag, i have a fairly good computer(it does need a bit of an upgrade) but this strike was like nothing before, so i looked for solutions, loaded back in and low and behold reduced lag.  I took one look at the scenery and logged straight back off, uninstalled and will never install again. by far the most ugliest survival game i've ever seen. Considering i play The Isle a lot, i figured Ark would be good fun but obviously not.  Do Not Recommend.
36mins of this shaight was enough for me.
ILL CHANGE MY REVIEW WHEN THEY REMOVE THE FUCK ICHTHYORNIS FROM THE GAME >:(
epic games deserve this game
joined game almost after 4 years break.. no any changes, still lots of bugs, crashes etc... wasted 42 hours and some euros on nothing.
shit game
it's not worth it. 55 euro for a game like snow. it takes 5 years to get into a server. -rep
GLITCHY ASS FUCKING GAM3
Don't waste your money on this game. It's not worth it, because it's very poorly developed and full of bugs and stupid ideas. Like slingshot lag, where you keep going back to 10 seconds before. And it's FAR too easy to die, as small monsters can effectively kill you in one hit because of their ability to knock you out with poison. And you get hungry and thirsty far too quickly too which is also annoying. It's also extremely hard to make any progress in this game as there are zero tutorials in game. And when you die you lose everything and have to keep starting over and over, making your gear who knows how many times. So you can never make any progress. I tried taming dinosaurs to protect me but half of them didn't even follow me around. Every now and then I would get a message saying my latest dino died from who knows what. And yes I set them to follow.
shit servers cant connect 0/10 shit fps . stutters . lags . trash game  I dont recommend this game for anyone
I bought this, because a lot of my friends play it, and because I like solo-sandbox style games.  The PVP aspect is Okay, but the solo-sandbox implementation is so full of bugs, with even critical resources failig to respawn. Sadly I only discovered these bugs that make the solo-sandbox pretty much unplayable, after the 2 hour window to request a refund had past. So I am stuck with a game that I will probably never play again.  Don't make the same mistake.
after almost 500 hours in this game i think i can leave a review now. good points: -big world -taming animals -building a base feels quite rewarding and satisfying   bad points: -official servers are swarmed by the chinese that will claim the whole server by placing poles so you cant build -taming a dino takes an awefull lot of time -you can easily die the moment you spawn -lots of players on servers pve or pvp are toxic -other players can (and likely will) pull an agressive dino to one your taming to kill it.
Pros: - TONS of prehistoric animals to tame, not just dinosaurs and not just from the Mesozoic era; includes everything from Ice Age mammals to giant prehistoric vultures. And almost all of them are tameable; the modding community even added more creatures based on prehistory, sci-fi, high fantasy, and even existing properties like Star Wars (X-wings, anyone?) - Fair amount of freedom when building a base - while not as good as it could be (Conan Exiles, another survival game, has marked improvements to building over ARK), it still allows players to build pretty much anywhere and any way they want. Want a sprawling fortress on the plains? You got it. Want a treehouse among the redwood trees? With a little effort, it can be done. Want a sky-base? ... Might wanna go to the Workshop for that, but with mods from there, it can be done. - Steam Workshop support - the mods for this game are both useful and extremely fun to use... though that goes without saying, now does it?  Cons: - Don't expect a warm welcome on older official servers; clans tend to block the base-building of new players with building pieces of their own, leaving the newbies to eek out a short living before being mauled by a pack of raptors. If you're new to survival games or just picking this game up for the first time, I'd recommend spending time in the singleplayer mode to get used to the mechanics, or finding a good unofficial server with friendly players on it. I say this not because I did it... but because I didn't. And I regretted it greatly. - Combat is a little on the bland side; tamed dinos are pretty much required to have any sort of fun or make any sort of progress in this game, and while many are useful in a scrap with wild dinos, it does leave the player character a little underwhelming in their own combat prowess, limited to primitive melee weapons with bare-bones mechanics at first, then evolving slightly to a 1st- or 3rd-person shooter once firearms are unlocked. - A good chunk of this game is spent grinding resources in the most time-consuming manner possible; again, dinos are pretty much a requirement to get anything done, which while it IS the main hook of this game, the material yield is just the right level to give you some sense of satisfaction, yet still be far off from your end goal (I'll talk about that in a moment). There's also an XP grind that can be unbearable without mods, along with a system of learning recipes (called engrams in-game), that, while encouraging tribe cooperation in multiplayer, severely limits those playing in singleplayers; without mods, you're left with a quarter of the engrams unlearned, and no points to learn them with. - The bosses, while giant and a spectacle, can take an eternity to get to, and even more of an eternity to kill. There are around 6 main boss types, but the variants bring that number up to 52 different fights. To even get to those bosses, though, you have to collect artifacts from the various cave systems dotted around the map, lug those artifacts up to the waypoints (obelisks in-game), dump those into the terminal, and then choose to teleport into an arena that, if you aren't at the head of an army of the biggest carnivores in the game, bears witness to your immediate death. Once again, coordination with other players is a must to defeat these bosses, but sadly, for a game that gives you very few limits in how to deal with dinos in the main game, you cannot be that creative in the boss arenas. The bosses also suffer from a problem that most games with shooter-based combat tend to suffer from; the strategy basically boils down to pumping as much lead into the boss as possible until it drops dead. But with dinosaurs. Yay. - This game ain't cheap, in price or storage; obviously this is a full-priced game, with occasional sales, but without those sales, you're sinking about $100-120 into ARK, which while functional, does suffer from issues usually associated with early-access games (which this game was for quite a long time.) The game also has no mercy regarding data storage; to give an idea as to how much space this game requires to be installed, my computer had around 16k megabytes of RAM maximum before installing this game. I have only 4 other games on Steam (3 of which are AAA titles), 1 from the Epic Games Launcher (3 guesses which one), and 2 from other sources. After installing ARK and all of the DLC for it, I have a grand total of 200 megabytes of RAM left for... literally nothing. Basically, once you buy and install the game, the devs expect, no, DEMAND, that you either uninstall ARK immediately or play nothing but ARK for the next few years. And again, there are parts of this game that feel unfinished like in an early-access game, and yet demands that you have the most advanced graphics cards and Internet connection to even attempt to play it. It's a classic case of style over substance, only this time only a select few can ever experience the full game, which admittedly does look gorgeous if you manage to get a machine strong enough to run it.  Conclusion: Normally I'd recommend this game based on its concept, beautiful settings, comprehensive list of tameable creatures, and surprising tidbits of hidden lore through explorer notes and dossiers (which I didn't mention since their main function is actually just an XP boost for you and whatever dino you happen to be riding... so meh), but I can't with good conscience due to its bare-bones combat, lackluster boss fights, tedious grinding, and the arrogance of the developers based on the astronomical demands placed on most computers to even run this game. However, if you like dinosaurs, have an advanced enough machine, and don't mind flushing your time and money down the sewer, I'd say give it a go. If you want all of this, a more functional combat system, a more coherent lore based on an established property, and for your CPU to not despise you, I'd recommend Conan Exiles instead.
boring
Is fun to start, but when You have to grind for 6 hours just to get to level 35 it gets repetative nad when u get raidded and lose all stuff  it not fun anymore, not from english speaking place so do no make fun me
ark = bad
THIS GAME SUCKS ASS IT IS SO FUCKING DUMB IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING GET SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THIS GAMES IS SHIT
this game fucking blows worse than conan tied with culling 2
I have to say this game is very nice looking but on the other hand it f ing sucks in gameplay.  Who ever idiots created this game made it for a specific group of players.  The game is fun to play but when you least expect it.  You die from various ways and have to start over on your charctor every f ing time.  I only played survival evolved  and it sucks.  I have tried to play this game and learn how to use it but the learning curve is BS and you get absolutely no help on how to play other than what you find on the internet.  I understand its survival but to tell you the truh its just a game that was designed to piss you off.  So I say good bye to this beautiful looking game.  And tell the devs to kiss my ass bitches....
Played this game for 30 minutes. No matter how low I set my graphic settings, I couldn't get the FPS above 5-15. I looked up a couple of youtube suggestions. I copied one guy's settings and got little reprieve. I found another video that suggested that I download a 3rd party performance booster. A game shouldn't need 3rd party software to be playable. In the comments on this video, several people suggested to clear running programs and exit Steam immediately upon startup of the game, etc. Again, I don't believe anyone should have to go to such lengths to play a game at it's lowest setting. I have no idea if the content or game play is good because I wasn't actually able to play it. I suggest avoiding this game unless you're willing to put in the effort to work out the video lag kinks.   PS: I don't have an awesome computer but it's a fairly good computer. I have a Lenovo Erazer with a GTX 970. I play lots of different games such as The Forest, Green Hell, WoW, Mafia II, Destiny II, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Overwatch, etc. I typically run these games on mid-high settings and have no trouble.   Hope this helps someone avoid wasting some money until ARK Devs address a seriously crippling graphics issue.
this game can't be played
I have an RTX 2080 and the game crashes every single time I try to play.
THIS GAME IS STEAMY HOT GARBAGE, STRAIGHT LAG AND PAIN.
Could have been a good game, but for some reason they cant manage the servers. The public servers lags all the time, the only time i dont experience lag is when the servers have crashed :O. There is the possibility to play on unofficial servers, but then you play mostly alone.
I have been playing Ark for at least 4 years. With the addition of Managarmrs to the game, I have to recommend people avoid purchasing for now. Unless you can find a good unofficial server with good administrators, play PVE, or go at the game solo, finding a good PVP server is close to impossible. Every day someone with a Managarmr circles the map, griefing whoever they can find. People hop with their Managarmrs between servers and grief, so fighting back or retaliating is almost impossible.
player can go under the map and destroy you base in offical server. The game is broken
I've played the game a fair amount and had fun doing it, but the devs need to step up and fix bugs rather than releasing new paid content. There are game-breaking bugs left in the game that have been known about for YEARS, and yet nothing has been done about them. Instead, they've left the community to find work-arounds that shouldn't be necessary. Finally quit the game when my wife's game stopped working with a known error that necessitates an hour's worth of verifying the game files' integrity before she could play each time. Not worth the trouble, and none of the community work-arounds solved the issue unfortunately.
It's a amazing game with great potential. but just all the exploits and meshing problems..... fix it wildcard...
i recently downloaded this so i can play with friends ive alaways loved this game i play it on ps4 amd for some reason on here i try to open it and it just wont work now all my other games do but not this and no soft i would reccomend i just need help for it to open
a broken buggy unfinished mess of a product, when the game isnt corrupting your progress you are torment to terribly communicated tasks due to poor design. Sandbox games i like, for example Terraria or Minecraft , understand to keep the objectives basics for the first few hours or so and to slowly introduce and tease more content to the player as they become more familiar to the mechanics. This shitfest on the other hand decides to make something as simple as creating a house a tedious chore because of once again the terrible communication to the player. I shouldn't need to read a wiki page to find out how to make some basic shelter. You're better off downloading a dinosaur mod for Minecraft, even that would probably be more polished and thought out than this trainwreck.
Crashes alot without no mods. Like what the fuck this is supposed to be a full released game.
Graphics glitching makes it unplayable. How can this game get this far with such horrific graphics bugs? Yes, the art is amazing, but things like reflections that you can't turn off makes it a straight refund for me. And you have to understand what I mean by reflections, I don't mean seeing your face in the water, I mean seeing your whole body, trees, and damn island on the ocean across the map. Metal and wood buildings artifact glitches from afar. Searching the community (which is friendly btw) for a solution, made my refund decision final. Aparently, everyone experiences this and says it's called SSR (Screen Space Reflection), and yea, it's there, you can't turn it off, but it's ARK, you'll learn to ignore it after a while. Okay, no.
This game held such promise, but unfortunately it never fulfilled any expectations.   Buggy, unoptimized, toxic community, overly-ambitious.   Even after all the years it's been out and upgraded and updated, I'd still rather pull my own fingernails out then load this POS up. It doesn't matter how OP your rig is: it'll run like it's a damn toaster.   And let's not even mention the fact that there are DLC's for this unfinished pile of crap. I'm not paying you any more of my money until you provide me with a functional, if not enjoyable, experience after all these years. Chislers.
This game is a glitchy mess. My friends and i originally had it for xbox one. there were bugs, and after several years we figured no one would be fixing them, but they were minor. we avoided the public servers and i rented a server for us to play on and we had a great time! then we noticed that the game had gone on sale in steam and we all decided to pay 50$ for the game+dlcs(AGAIN), because we loved the game despite its many glitches and flaws and wanted to try mods out. now im convinced that wildcard is a shitty, shitty, company. somehow the pc version of the game is 10x worse than the console version. and i regret giving my money to these shit programmers and supporting the kind of behavior that leads a company to assume that it can release a game as horribly broken as this.
Random server crash for the last few hours. Too common!!!!!!
SHOULDVE BOUGHT RUST INSTEAD OF THIS SHIT GAME
Bad
Slow, clunky, looks like it could be ran on a Playstation 2 with the same framerate. Moving causes the world to preform a Microsoft PowerPoint transition effect to constantly create the world 30 feet in front of you.   The high point of me starting this game up was when I shit myself trying to figure out how to turn on someone else's abandoned campfire and the low point is when it despawned before I could pick it up and throw it at something
For the love of pete, PLEASE OPTIMIZE! I played this a LOT when my computer could still handle the amount of stuff packed inside the game.  It's been over a year since I was able to play without cringing out of my skull about the lag and grainy textures. Its the same damn computer, and some of us can't afford bigger, badder upgrades just to play ARK...... It's amazingly fun and detailed, but its SO HARD TO ENJOY WHEN YOU CANT EVEN LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE MURDERED BY BEGINNER CREATURES HIDING IN THE GRASS.  PLEASE. OPTIMIZE. Until then I can't recommend buying this unless your computer is on the beefy side.
this game literally requires a computer from nasa
Hungry, Thirsty, Tired, Grind, Repeat.
I used to really enjoy playing this game, but recently the instability has made it incredibly unenjoyable. It's crashed and caused me to die and lose everything I had around 8 times just in the past 24 hours. And no, it's not my PC causing the issue, I have a Ryzen 5 1600 at 3.9GHz, a GTX 1080 8GB, and 16GB of DDR4 2933MHz. The crashes are completely random, and there's nothing that's consistently been done before each crash. This shouldn't be an issue with a game that costs as much as it does, especially when it's been out for several years.
If optimization could be totally stripped from a game, you would have Studio Wildcard. They also made that total, cesspool of a game ATLAS, so if you put your trust in these guys, I guess you can put your trust in anything by that measure. Don't buy it. It ain't worth it.
Shittiest game of all time, would not even play if it was free. Full of bugs and terrible graphics. Not at all like the screenshots.
i hate this game idk why  tal ha homo ve ho lo mode
rust KNockOFf, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE      Doodle dip
Very bad as for newbie! Graphic seems like trash!
fucking cancer game my official server is gone fucking wildcard fix
Mixed feelings for the game but it gets a thumbs down, due to the moral focus of the company.  Doesn't mean I won't play it with friends but can I recommend it to people who haven't bought it, that answer is a NO.  Thoughts behind it are:  Played in early access which the bugs are understandable and acceptable. Watched them switch from game development to DLC content. 1st red light Watched them claim the game is released. 2nd red light Watched the game get worse with dlc content adding to the mess that is the core game which in my opinion is not going to get any better support from wildcard.  Saddly my biggest bug frustration is the keybinding issues of the numeric pad then more on the core mechanics bugs (which are on the ways they bridged the union between console and keyboard)  issues of the game.  All I know if the game was released in it's current state (so early access is not a concept), before any mod's from the mod community or DLC's to try to provide replayability, it would have been recieved like no man's sky.  I'm not against early access but companies like wild card are wrecking the concept if they can't release respectable game quality in a reasonable time frame before they announce "released".  Worse is how quick they focused on cash generation. I don't have insight to their books so I can't say poor cash management or one to many new car's wanted but I'm pretty sure it wasn't that they where not making enough.
The moderation staff for this game are biased, overzealous, and unreasonable.
Bug fest and bad devs
Cant even play it because it runs so badly on mac 
90% time of Disconnect.
I do not recommend it in its current state.  The performance is unacceptable. I can run games much more graphically advanced than this at ultra graphics.  Relevant Specs: Intel i7-6820HK 3.7GHz(currently underclocked to 3.4GHz) Nvidia GTX 980M (8gb) 16gb DDR4 Memory  It runs at ~30 FPS at absolute bare minimum settings (which might be the most visually unappealing thing I have set eyes on). I actually looked forward to this but was seriously bummed when I couldn't run it, and ended up refunding it.  The gameplay is a good, unique concept. I like the ideas and presentation thereof. I will repurchase it once there is evidence of improvement.   [b]Dev's, it doesnt matter how cool a game is, someone can't appreciate it if they can't run it because you don't spend time optimizing it. If you don't know how, take a class on it.[/b]
One of the prime examples of corporate greed ruining what could of been an absolutely amazing game  so sad seeing the devs just care about pumping out DLCs instead of actually fixing the game first, this game is a tragedy because of how when playing it you can see the insane potential it has and all the great elements of it but then the ridiculous bugs and just broken shit and flat out terrible game design just ruins any hopes for this game.  
this game is really really bad waste of 50 bucks if you buy the expansion with it so i feel like i could make this game from a steam app game maker thats how bad it is if you pay for this like i did you are contributing to the problem with games today i feel bad i gave them my money i wish i would have just donated that money to cd projekt red or some thing i feel like this game deserves no support  at all it should still be in beta or early access this game taught me do not give money to early access games because thats not what they are they are pretty much putting out shit to see if they can get their money and if they do they will be like fuck it we got the cash why do anything else with that old shit we will just release the fixed game under a new name lets call it atlas we will make a boat load of money .....
This game has been out for how long? Still feels like alpha.
TERRIBLE WORTHLESS GAME THAT NO ONE PLAYS!!!
This game sucks major balls.  I'm so angry right now and just need to vent as the building in this game is terrible.  You can't place a  structure without the cursor randomly cycling all over the place and destroying already placed items.  I've spent the last 20 minutes trying to laying 2 ceiling tiles and wasted tons of materials.  Holy Fudge!  Oh yeah, and I can only run this game in DX10 as DX11 crashes because this game is so darn good.
I loved the gameplay and concept of this game but it crashes so often to the point that it's just being unplayable. I tried a lot to fix the crashing problems myself. My specs are good enough to run it, my drivers are up to date, I turned the shadows all the way to low, etc. Nothing is working. I really want to enjoy this game but in the state it's in right now, it's garbage.
Run away from this piece of crap, continually crashes, loads bad files onto your system. Maybe got 15min at most playtime before crash, all the setting adjustments to try to make this poop work equaled bout 3hrs, so if ur having problems stop before 2 hrs. This just seems to be a beta let out.  rtx 2070
Refunded
could be  a great game, but this game is still a complete lagfest
 lazy devs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA Refunded
This game is very fun to play but the multyplayer is so bad it kicks me off so much. When i try to join a freind theres always a lame dumb error. The devs don't care about who plays and only want the money to flow in. Devs, start talkin to the players and keeping your promises.
If you already thought that GTA5 (84 GB) or Payday (55 GB) are filesize-attention-whrs - then have a look at this game - "140 GB" without mods... They should include a free harddrive with it OR at least remove large DLC-files from game folder that you haven't bought yet...
It wont crash, it just doesnt stop I cant even play without it crashing. Good game for if you want to deal with crashes.
it would be a lot of fun if the community wasn't so cancerous.
whoever made this game is poo poo
Terrible experience with this game. Where to even begin? Oh wait - I couldn't. That's right, your game didn't even let me join my friend's lobby after downloading for so long and it's pathetic that your game won't EVEN LOAD. RUBBISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ ARK: Survival Devolved
Do yourself a favour and do not play this game. It's frustrating. Look at my playtime. I just lost some of my strongest creatures because they suddenly stopped moving and attacking in the middle of a fight and my whole process. They were all on follow and neutral and still died to a raptor and a spino because they weren't attacking back. My Ravanger suddenly decided to run away and I had to install a mod to find it again. She was level 311 and died to a level 40 Karkinos on the way back to the base because she did not attack back and just stood still.  I assumed it was a bug and restarted the game ( singleplayer), joined as usual but even tho I still play the same character I'm no longer the owner of my dinosaurs and base. My base is completely locked from me. All my dinosaurs names are red, what means they are no longer my tames. I played over 900 hours and lost all my process. And the funniest part is that it happend like 3 times during the time I owned the game but always started a new game. Guess this game can suck my non existing wiener.
this game is fucking awful, buy dinosaur hunt instead!!!!! I am serious I would rather play dinosaur hunt.
I'd rather die.
its like jurassic park edition of rust but god awful
garbage
bad
After buying the game i was amazed by the graphics but was disappointed in how the game developers treats their community and the insane amount of bugs the developers have neglected to fix do not waste 60$ on a game like this. 
Building system sucks. Counter-intuitive and illogical mechanics.
This game was cool and fun at first, but a lot of things ruined it. I had to set down the graphics because of the lag, even so, there is still some lag in the game. The game has crashed many times even with toned down graphics. There are also many glitches in the game. Also, the game play is too complicated. I wanted to play this in single player, but the survival exploration aspect makes this game too tedious and too time consuming. Too much inventory management, too much crafting, too much surviving. So much time can be spent taming a animal just for it to get lost or killed. More powerful animals can come out of no where and kill me without any chance for me to escape.  I hate it how i can easily run out of resources which means that i need to restart the whole game. I also hate that there are unfair ways to die, like for instance this one time i died because i accidentally ate some poisonous thing. Too many bad decisions like upgrading the wrong skills, using resources unwisely, going to a dangerous territory unprepared, forgetting to carry certain things, losing things, getting lost, and losing rare items. Without respawn, the game would be totally unfair, but in a survival game there shouldnt even be any respawning, yet the survival conditions in this game are too realistic even though respawning contradicts all that. I dont like it how the game actually expects me to play on multiplayer, but what about first learning how to play the game first in single player? Too many annoying people in multiplayer. The game is just too difficult, time consuming, and buggy.
Put it on full release with 59.99 CAD and is not much better than when it's early access which at the time 29.99 CAD, the game is not bad but only buy it if you like base building, survival game and with sales. I will not recommend it as of now.Hope I will one day as the game is actually not too bad. Fix a few bugs, improved graphics, and a massive update(like no man's sky) than I might change my stand.
Just got the game, played 10min i knew i should regret this and so i did. Want refund this really fast haha
Good game, sucks devs don't care about the playerbase. Wait till they fix (if ever).
optimise the game please, I want to play this game but it shouldn't make me feel like I'm playing it in an aquarium or smtn...
used to be epic game, but it's fallen behind and gets boring. I used to love it.
Its a very open world where you have to find your death point every time you die, and dont think any of the world will be mercy to you as you have no gear neather levels.  Over all its a very boring game where the only fun part is that you get to ride on the back of prehistoric beasts.
horribly optimized, lots of bugs and ugly ass graphics even on epic settings. there are hundreds of survival/crafting games out there, why would you buy this mess? devs are lazy or just simply dont care, dont give them your money !
I bought this game the 28 Feb, 2016, which means i bought it before the game was released and the sad part is that there are bugs that have been in the game since then. The creators of the game made DLC´s for this game before it was even released. So instead of fixing what was wrong about the game they just left it as is and started selling new products of the game.   I´ve been playing this game on and off for three years and yet till this day, more than 3 years since i bought it, the game still crashes and causes my computer to crash as well. As many others have said, this game could of been the perfect game (for me) but the developers has not listened to the community and left the game quite buggy and annoying to play.  The brightness in the game is way to light and it almosts hurts your eyes if you do not fix it by using commands.
Good cause it has dinos but other than that no pvp,  you can't even land consistantly on a platform. don't buy or yah know load in to a server
This game is REDICULOUSLY hardware hungry..  My Specs: i7-4790k 4ghz GTX 980 16gig ram  1080p (everything turned off/low) = 60 fps (100% resolution scale) the only way to get 120+ is to reduce the resolution scale back into the 90s, which looks like i forgot my glasses again.. GLHF trying to identify a dinosaur from 100+ meters away.  also keep in mind that these results were at the peaceful starting beach ^^ If you are sensitive to low framerates and you dont have a Beastly computer that basicly wasnt even invented when this game launched, by all means give it a shot.. otherwise i'd stay as far away as possible.
worst
After 176 hours play time I have finally uninstalled ARK.  The concept of the game is fantastic and it looks great but sadly it is plagued by bugs & lazy developers.  Even after countless huge patches (you end up having to download about 200MB+ a week to keep the game up to date) the developers still haven't renamed the games .exe file, it is still named ShooterGame.exe which is unreal engines DEFAULT .exe name.
Broken unoptimized game don't buy it
maybe better later once its not in alpha anymore
This game is still a buggy, laggy mess that punishes your hundreds of hours of grinding harshly for any conflict outside of pve, and the devs dont even fix the glaring bugs that have been here since day one. Also it still grows in storage size, something like 250gb now.
Game tries to start up Instantly crashes Not my end I fixed everything Went through online guides  The whole nine yards Turns out game is just shit And wont run properly
I love this game. It is awesome in many ways. But, it is so full of glitches and it is so slow it ruins the experience. It takes an extremely long time to open it is very annoying. Also, it takes a very long time to download. When I first got this game, I was very happy that I finally got it, I was looking everywhere to get it and I couldn't find it. Then, I found it on steam and got it. I saw that it said like 10 days to download and I didn't believe it. A whole day passed and it started saying I had hours playing the game when I had never even opened it. It literally took about a week to download for no reason. Then, It finally downloaded, I played for like 5 hours and all of a sudden, the game deleted from my pc. So I tried downloading it again. This time it was easier and I was able to play. But, I had almost the lowest possible graphics and it was extremely slow. It took about 30 seconds to open the inventory every time which extremely annoyed me. If you're going to get this game, know that these things might happen to you as well  even if you have a good pc. Mine is a 3000 dollar set up and couldn't deal with this game. Maybe I just got unlucky. But for me, it is impossible to play.
Unplayable on RTX 2060 due to being incompatible somehow. Crashes after 10 seconds ingame. Any other game works just fine. Apparently its the same thing on other graphics card from the turing family.
This game had some really big potential but with the power creep with new expansions which in turn added new creatures, it has created a imbalance.  I honestly believe that newer creatures that have been introduced into Ark shouldn't be transferred to older maps. For example, The Island and The Center is the first versions of Ark, while Ragnarok and Scorched Earth is the newer versions.  While you can tame like Wyverns in Scorched Earth, you can transfer them to other Scorched Earth servers and Ragnarok but shouldn't be able to transfer to the Island and the Center. Especially the Managarmr which has totally created a imbalance throughout the whole game.  I potentially see it as a way for farmers to farm these and sell them in the black market for people to buy which in turn they can have fun wiping the entire map. Wildcard has made a problem with these new expansions that doesn't do anything to fix the creep that has plagued people who which to start but can't even get anything up if the are wiped by end game content in beginner maps(The island). If you are new to Ark, you are too late to get into official. Your chance to get established has gone and you will just end up hating this game after wasting countless hours of getting wiped off the map by Managarmrs.
I have spent- WASTED, 139 hours on this complete pile of sparkling garbage. This is absolutely unacceptable. Not only does the developer continue to ignore simple bugs, but in the past has actually said they've 'fixed' things in updates but in reality have done no such thing. For one, I WISH I COULD FUCKING PLAY IT. More than half of my 136 hours has been spent trying to get the damn thing to work past the first loading screen. I have a pretty good computer, I can run all of my other games flawlessly. I can run the game on high graphic settings, but only when it works. For example: frozen loading screens, black screen, not responding, random crashes, freezing mid-game, and that is just when the game refuses to work. In game glitches I've had to deal with: Falling through the map, Dinosaurs spawning directly in my house/base (breaking them), being flung out to the ocean, getting stuck in rocks, for the sake of the reader I'll stop here. The reality is, bug fixes don't sell games. So, instead of fixing things they come out with a new DLC. This is by far the worst money grabbing scum of a developer I have honestly ever seen. They only thing I regret is I spent 136 hours trying to like the game in vain, and In doing such have lost the ability to refund my horrible mistaken purchase.
! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DONT BUY THIS GAME! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !   This game is straight up bad, Its a great game don't get me wrong, but there are so many game breaking mechanics such as people going under you base and blowing up, no matter what you do to stop them, nothing works. the devs dont do anything to help their game, they don't fix the issue they ban people who help expose issues. they only care about money. unless you spend £1000+ on your PC, enjoy playing on less than 1920 x 1080 because the game isn't optimized. just dont waste your money game game like rust instead. also the community, the most toxic community that has every existed.  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DONT BUY THIS GAME! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Too much lag too much meshing and one of my big complaints is keeps on crashing cannot fix if know how to fix post it or respond but fix this bull you should already have a fix and you dont until then i am sad that i waisted money and will leave this
i love this game but it wont let me play it i have a good computer but every time i open it it crashes
Horrible. Even on low settings the game freezes and crashes.
Well, i have more then one reason, first is that it runs poorly( less then 20 fps and my pc is a beast), this game is not fun, i played it for 300 hours to see if is really worth the time and the money, and i don't like it that much, i'm missing more then half of the multiplayer servers(only the modded ones show, i can't see any official servers). My opinion: Is poorly optimized, Server network is bugged, the gameplay is full of glitches and bugs, game community is made out of toxic kids and tryhards.
It is fun to play, when it works. Many hours that should have been spent playing have instead been spent fixing crashes and connection failures that are at no fault of my internet or my system. This game is worth maybe 20 dollars with all dlc's included. Server issues that were had in 2017 are still issues now, a full 2 years later. Which is quite unacceptable for any full price game, or anything near it. Especially since there are not even any error codes to help explain the problem in the forums or the Ark websites support helpdesk. These kinds of issues so long after release shows nothing but laziness and disregard for the playerbase in its entirety. I have been very patient in diagnosing and solving issues but to no avail. I want these issues fixed ASAP, and plenty of others do too.
this game sucks ass, couldnt join friends games also crashed alot
OK so i waited TWO HOURS for it to download. Then when it did download, I COULDNT PLAY IT! IT KEPT KICKING ME OFF!!!  Refund Please...
broke
This is the worst optimization i ever seen. You need a NASA supercomputer to actually run it on good graphics and good FPS. Otherwise it will look like pixelated shit.
I just requested a refund for the linux version of Ark! Absolutely horrendous! The game wouldn't work! I tried fiddling with it for hours. It just froze at the splash screen. And then I learned, mainly from youtube reviews, that the devs refuse to work on the linux version at all. Like they just pooped it out for more sales. And for those linux gamers that somehow got the game to work, the quality of the linux version is even way worse than the highly polished windows version! If you're a linux gamer, don't waste your money! And I'll be looking into games before I buy them from now on!
Dont waste your time with this game. It has been out for years and yet they still have so many bugs and glitches. It would be ok if they were small but in the past 3 days I have lost about 8 tames to the mesh and the server keeps crashing and rolling back. The Devs have to be pushed to fix the smallest things in the game and if you look at youtube you will know what i am talking about.
Really not a great game, but I'm sure everyone got that by now.  - Bad graphics optimisation, it needs a lot of performance - A lot of grind on vanilla settings, too much to have fun as a single player - The servers REALLY suck a**, always full and bad connection - Public servers aren't fun (PVP's are ruled by one tribe, PVE's are full of buildings and ruins) - No updates to fix problems and bugs for years, they only add more useless dinos - Etc....  Do not get it, especially not as full price. If you really want to try it out, get it for under 20€
Hinnang: 1/10
I wasted my money on this freaking game. I cant even play it this is a rip off don't play this game if your on windows pc 
Fundmentaly broken at a base level and is only ever fun with group of friends. The amount of complete and utter bullshit that can screw you over and wipe away any kinda progress you make is infuriating. And that’s not even getting into the astronomical infestation of bugs and glitches that are in the game from getting stuck inside tames to falling through the map. I absolutely love playing with my friends but far more times then not it is an exercise in frustration. Only buy it on sale with friends that already have it. Go spend your money a better game
just don't buy this go buy something ales. They don't fix bugs and just move you onto new maps with the same and new bugs. but if you do play with mods on the maps you get rather then buying new maps. 3/10 game 0/10 game developers.
Why do updates for this game take so long? I can download triple A titles in less time than a single 600Mb Ark update over a 256 megabit connection.  Seriously, this really ruins any desire to play the game.
Terrible buggy game that will never be fixed by wildcard. Majority of the PvP community is toxic, you WILL be constantly harassed and raided by someone that is streaming with only 100 viewers. There are players that will try to help you but there are too many trolls for them to deal with. I would only recommend this game for the PvE experience, other than that even if this game is on sale for $10, go buy something else. Hot liquid diarrhea at mach 1 speeds will literally leave you feeling better than this game will.
I played this game for a long time.  I recently reinstalled the game to get back at it.  In 2 hours the game has crashed over 10 times.  I've had to verify the files each time and each time a file would be unable to validate.  The files seem to be eating themselves.
1 big MEH
Doesn't work with rtx cards, freezes after 2min everytime no matter the settings, do not buy until fixed, no point
Quite literally the worst experience i have ever had with setting up a dedicated multiplayer server.
The next evolution after Day Z in unoptimized / unpolished trash.  Imagine having a game in early access, having the nerve to release DLC, then seemingly out of nowhere releasing it to 1.0 with hundreds of glitches and bugs along with tripling the price.  Now imagine taking said broken hunk of shit, and dressing it up as a pirate game a year later.   People who champion this game are unironically no life kissless permavirgins and or children. You can not enjoy this game or even reach "end game content" without being a shut in NEET with a hefty supply of Mt Dew and poop socks.   (inserts some witty quote about how this game needs to die like the dinosaurs >:3  )
Buggy mess
Not a fan of the survival genre at all and discovered that truth by playing this game. For you survival lovers out there I think this is for you. For me, nah.
plz let me get started
The game is designed badly, and punishes you for the smallest thing, but not in a way that is enjoyable or rewarding.   The amount of times I have spawned into a new world in an 'easy' location and be spawned right next to a raptor, spino or alpha is insane.   If you by some miracle win the spawn lottery and are able to set up a small base without getting rolled by carnivorous dinos before you have weapons, then it is time to explore and slowly branch out to other areas, only, once you walk 500m you will be killed by high level dinos that camp your gear, making it next to impossible to retrieve.   So you decide to stay in your comfy spawn location for a little longer (a few hours) until you are geared enough to take on some dinos, you have even managed to tame some yourself. You go exploring again, only, your dinos start attacking something that is far too high a level and die, losing any items they had on them, so you run away, only to be chased down by an alpha raptor that you failed to see behind a rock. Now you have accidentally dragged an alpha to you home 3 hours into the game after losing all of you gear. Have fun dying over and over trying to slowly lure it away from your base.   OK, so now you have some metal tools organised after hours of grinding and losing dinos and gear over and over. You have a pteradon which can fly for about 15 seconds before needing to take a rest, but you suppose that's better than nothing, so you venture out again. You are flying over a swampy area but it's ok because you are able to land on some tall rocks to regain your flyer's stamina. You are a fair way away from home so you are about to turn back around before something BS happens. TOO LATE! a croc flies out of the water and 20 metres into the air to tackle you off your flyer. Because you have your flyer set to neutral, guess what happens, he comes in to save the day! You both die and cannot retrieve your gear that you grinded for hours to get, because it is so far away and that was your only flyer.  You quit the game, done with its BS. You exit to desktop only for the game to freeze your PC for 5 minutes just to rub salt into the wounds as a final F you.  TLDR: The game is bad and unrewarding. You can play as passive or as aggressive as you want, and get everything stripped from you either way. I would not recommend this to anyone.
delete all game for this game
the lag and constant disconnects make this game almost unplayable on the official servers. its a great game but ABSOLUTELY RUINED by the  technical issues. if you havnt bought this game then dont waste your money on it. if you've already bough it then you're  so addicted to it that you grunt cuss and slam your keyboard through issues just to play a little longer.
bad needs to buy another pack to play 
Loved the idea, but the game keeps resetting all my settings and in game settings or i wake up the next morning to all my single player progress gone. Its just not worth the time and hassle.
I thought id give this game a chance even with the review but no its just a complete mess. its buggy beyond belief and you cant even join a server without the game crashing.
Dont support Wildcard
it wont let me play the game and i just bought the game
Runs horribly and even on high settings the graphics look like something out of the Nintendo 64 era.
Well First off I just want to say great graphics... however for all users that want to play it on mac, don't. It runs poorly and everytime you walk the lag is INSANE so if u want to play on your mac make sure it can run smoothly first.
* Devs don't care at all   * Devs leave game breaking bugs in the game  * Comunity is cancer  *Devs ban a guy who exposes there shit https://youtu.be/85CemXW6lPA  * You will be ddosed   * DLC in early access   *Devs have pure greed  * Wasted potential
So i bought this game (April 2019) in high hopes but i had to get a refund because it kept crashing after 15 minutes of gameplay every time. Apparently this is a common bug with the engine :(  My specs GPU: Zotac RTX 2060 6gb CPU: i5-8400 6 cores @ 3.9GHz MEMORY: 16gb gskill ripjaw V 2400MHz PC19200 PSU: EVGA 450w BT bronze cert OS: Win 10 education   I've never had this happen with any other game. Wish I couldv'e played it ;(
I like the game but it takes 30mins to load now o.0
Devs are lazy and there is too many bugs, get something else instead.
Cant Even Connet to My Friend Server
This game is great! Tons of content and most of my specs go above the recommended (some only above minimum). The only problem with this game is that it is unplayable. You cannot enter one second before those fans go running at high speeds trying to cool off the temperature of over 90 degrees celsius. I do not recommend this game to anyone, not even for just $20, which is actually what I initially payed for it.
Huge waste of time, extremely laggy, hard to understand/get started in. Bought this on sale and refunded it within an hour. Could not enjoy.
can't recommend a game with this many crash bugs even after all these years.    I enjoyed the idea of the game, the game play is there, but the bugs wear you down.  I've been playing this game off and on since it launched in early access, coming back every few months or more to see if they've fixed the bugs that keep pushing me away.  They've added more and more content to round out the game sure, but bug fixing has always been something the devs seemed to tackle halfheartedly, always in favor of new mechanics, higher tech ladders, and more DLC maps (as was seen when they pushed DLC while still in Early Access).  Which don't get me wrong, is awesome, but they desperately needed to focus a lot more attention to fixing these crash bugs that most just consider "the norm" at this point.  Finding a server that fits you is a very tedious endeavor.  Playing solo is very rough and not very rewarding, the constant crashes making you lose progress are infuriating (game intermittently saves itself, but when out doing stuff in the wild and riding dinos it won't).  The game is just designed to play over long periods of time with other players filling out the daily cycle of tribe chores.  It's a lot of fun when you find a good server to play on, but they tend to flame out as they become over built or under manned, and OFFICIAL servers are cesspools of spawn denial camps/traps to even try to get started on now.  More than anything this game was poorly coded at it's core, MANY players give up playing just due to not being able to find any way to deal with the crash bugs and the devs have never seemed to make much of a priority on fixing bugs, they just keep adding new DLC maps (or reskinning it and selling it as a new game, *cough* ATLAS)
still trash
Don't buy this game if you have a mac, crashes when opening the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
you need a goddamn ferrari if u wanna run this game
Ok then let's go.  This game, may appear at first to resemble something like Rust, some kind of survival simulator with a dino-tech theme. You'd nearly be correct, nearly. Picture this.  An island, near barren and devoid of any meaningful world building or lore mechanics, instead populated very, very densely with the rabid and chaotic AI of dinosaurs and random animals. They don't feel like anything more than bulk assets dumped on a landmass. Many of these animals and Dinosaurs serve no actual purpose, they slide around bumping into each other, drifting against rock formations, never really seeming to know where (or what) they are. The conditions to be targeted by the AI seem to be completely random, and if a raptor 200m away starts running for you, you're beyond helpless. There's no way to respawn without dying afaik, so when you inevitably get glitched into a rock or tree prepare to wait out your character dying of starvation. Which luckily, won't take long.  That's another thing, your crippled starving character can not walk for more than 2 minutes without needing bulk water and meat to survive, and even when you've got them on hand, the game bombards you with "It's hot out here, find some shelter" literally straight into "It's cold out here, find some warmth", not exaggerating, the game seems intent on not letting you just... be.   The real worst part to me is the aesthetic of the whole ordeal, you'll look down form a cliffside and see dozens of random dinosaurs, fluro pink, bright green, glowing red, basically all the colours you don't want dinosaurs to be. The big ones are usually half glitched into a mountain, emitting an AOE of stomp damage.  There are random light pillars across the island that serve essentially as waypoints, they may have a purpose but pretty sure it's DLC related so of course no access for young skrubs.   Once you level up, build a shack, research weapons etc you will have access to a lot more of the game, but even then it's just such a hollow experience. Other players can be friendly, but usually you'll just get a spear to the back. The game just feels like someone got their hands on a map editor and just started pasting assets with deranged AI, it feels like the EARLIEST of early access games, but instead of finishing it they just made like 8 DLC maps.
Wild card is easily one of the snottiest, sh''iest, companies out there. They made a buggy game with unstable servers and its remained that way all the way up until now. They released an absolutely atrocious game that was literal reskin of ark under a different name. Your server will  bug out, your customization will suck, your experience will be lack luster. Dont buy this garbage. 
I want so badly to like this game. I tried to do as much as possible. Its just not fun for me. The early game is always a grind. If you play with other people online you will likely be captured or murdered very quickly and they tend to wreck or steal anything you have of slight value. I keep hearing its possible to have fun if you find a group of friends and stick with them. Was never able to find more than one person at a time I could trust to make this an enjoyable experience.  Not recommended for most people.
Fuck you Wildcard
I have no Idea why I played Ark so much, because the more I played it, the more I resented it: If you like survival games, you'll probably like Ark. You might be able to sink a lot of time into the game as I did, but that does not mean I would recommend it. I must admit I had a lot of fun with it, and still play it from time to time, but have not gone back to playing it a lot.  Ark does have a shit-ton of content and Stuff to explore, because there are so many things you can craft, dinosaurs to tame, etc. But whether that content is worth it depends on what kind of player you are.   One thing that i really like about Ark is that they tried to make every species in the game feel unique. What I mean by this is that almost every dinosaur has something unique about them, and if not, is an interesting combination of some abilities seen in other dinosaurs. Something that makes Ark stand out from other games is that you will basically stay one of the weakest beings in the game. Your power comes only from the dinosaurs you tame. That can make your dino dying, while you have no easy way back to your base really tense, even if you have the best armor, weapons, etc. It is basically never a viable option to attack a medium or strong dino without dinos to back you up,  or trapping them first. My biggest gripe with the game is the abundance of bugs and performance issues the game still has, despite being "released". From the performance perspective, Ark feels like an early access game, while costing 60 € if you do not buy it on a sale. I cannot understand how they keep adding more content to the game, but still can't manage to make the game perform well. (But performance-wise, I think the people who bought the switch version got screwed the most)  Another thing I do not really like about the game is that taming a dinosaur can take really long. Even though my singleplayer game had some difficulty turned down it could still take half an hour to tame a larger Dinosaur and Multiplayer is even worse from what I heard (Although, to be fair, you can have friends take over for you in multiplayer) Note that I have almost exclusively played in Singleplayer and cannot make statements on how nice / horrible the community is or might be This review is not negative, because I do not want people to buy the game. If you really want a survival game with dinosaurs, Ark is pretty much your only option, so, by all means, buy it. I just want the devs to improve the performance of the game
oh god PLEASE JUST FLATTEN YOUR GAME, 127 GIGABYTES, I CANT BREATHE SERIOUSLY, my computer is trash but this game takes that trash to the next level, theres no reason it should take up this much RAM and disc space, the processing is so bad my otherwise silent desktop makes a sad squealing noise..,, EVEN THEN i was still playing this game on 12 FPS, ALL settings as low as they could go, mouse S.Lag, crashes, etc etc put up with that for A HUNDRED HOURS. its HELL  would i play it again in it's current state? hecc no i cant even download it let alone navigate menus when it does come up. piece of garbage with equally trashy developers.  ...  but dinosaurs...............
Anti aliasing is totally broken, game looks like total shit
Buggy, constantly having issues, they dont have seperate meta for pvp vs pve and only cater to pvp which is toxic and sucky in its own way because they refuse to enforce rules and just end up hurting everyone with pointless nerfs
Logged into "easy safe zone" according to game. Was immediately slain by an elite Alpha Raptor mob. Respawned somewhere else. Made a campfire and it was immediately destroyed by another raptor, which then proceeded to kill me.  Finally respawned in an area where I wasn't one shot as soon as it loaded. Couldn't place campfire because "too close to enemy" buildings. Ran for about 30 minutes real time trying to place my campfire, but other players build a small pillar every few yards to keep other people from being able to build.  Tried a different map called Ragnarok. Huge lag spikes making me teleport everywhere. Harvesting rocks and wood did nothing due to the severe lag. When I complained in chat all the other players said that the horrid lag was typical for all Ragnarok maps.  I logged off at this point and requested a refund. No wonder this game has horrible reviews.
Spent 3 hours trying to get the game to work and because i passed the 2 hour mark (without a single minute of actual gameplay) steam wont let me return it. furthest i could get was the main screen and no further.
ive played this game since 2015 ive put it over 8k hours on both consoles and pc combined. I love this game to death and it is one of my favorite things. I could never give up on this game but for now i have to take a break because the point this game is at is nearly unplayable unless you make it your job. All the game is, is mana's and undermeshing and i undersatnd that wildcard is doing things to help but they take to long and don't do enough. They kept making DLC instead of improving the QOL and it shows. If there going to add new modes like classic pvp then they need to cover all fields like duo servers and such. with how the game is now dont buy it wait to months and watch some videos on how its doing. Thank you
This is a decent game overall, but I have one huge problem with it. The file size it TOO BIG. I like keeping the games that I play installed, but this one game takes up over 1/3 of my hard drive. 128 GB. This is just absurd.
retarded game bugged and unplayable, crashes and there is an error in finding files so i need to re-download it
great idea... bad execution... bad servers... bad everything
I wanted to love this game, I really did.  It just never came together.  I gave it several tries to play through, but could not stick with it and found myself focusing more on trying to mod the game than actually play it.  Sadly, considering the things the studio has done since I originally purchased this game, I'll never buy another one of their products.
absolute ass game, mesh op, bob life= tragedy.  
Trying to run Ark on my girlfriend's brand new 1660ti is more trouble than its worth. This 30 day old card runs every other game excellently but for some reason ark will not run for more than 2 minutes unless we use Direct X 10. Are you kidding me??   Even if it did work I have bittersweet feelings about this game. I will admit if there is a time to play Ark it is with friends on a private server with faster rates.   If you're dead set on getting this game buy it on sale. For the sake of all that is good in this world do not give these developers 70 of your hard earned dollars.
pvp too much raid , pve no place on map to build wanna play new map pay mate too much greed
This is bug filled game with lots of problems, bad developers, poor community managers.  The whole time you play you will have 20-40 second lags, your dinos (which you tamed for hours) will be lost, and they will not be restored by support team.  This is a bad example of how to make a game.
this game introduced me to braxxac
What the fuck Studio Wildcard. The game was already a buggy mess and when a Youtuber tries to help raise awareness about an absolutely game breaking glitch which has been in the game for literal years, instead of fixing the issue you ban him. Despite this the game can be enjoyable at times but its often times frustrating with all the simple issues like bodies floating away so you can't harvest them, being unable to hit rocks and collect bushes unless you bend over backwards half the time, the base building is almost unbearable without the addition of mods. This all sounds very negative and well that's because it is, but at heart the game is extremely fun especially with friends however its overshadowed by all the negatives, due to this I cannot recommend the game in the state it currently is in and has been in for quite some time.
Wildcard does not support it's community. Spend hours on hours for it to be gone in 20 min! 55€ game!
55€
fuck this buggy as game man dont waste countless of hours just to get meshed or raided by 60 koreans
Game is so bad at the moment used to love this game so much because of my love for dinosaurs but the greedy development team would rather ban you than fix game breaking bugs. My game crashes all the time if im lucky enough to load into a map the textures are horrible on high and medium setting even though my pc can handle it since ive handled it before, even my old pc didnt have these bad textures then the game crashes again. I just feel the devs have milked a certain demographics of people to make a buggy cash grab.
The game is trash, the support team is also trash, they wont fix anything for you, and wont give back your character.
I cant update the game to the latest version
I bought ARK when it was early access, and I feel like it never became what it could of. Instead of pushing the game to it's full potential, they just rushed it for a full release and started making DLC. I still enjoy this game, but it still has so many problems I think most people assumed would be fixed, but have instead been ignored.
I enjoy this game how ever the developers are some lazy Mother**** and decide to make a new game rather than work on the one they currently have. It is at beta at least and the call this trash fire a finished game while selling it for $50 plus more for DLC. This game is far from finished and needs vast improvement.  The issues: *Game breaking bugs *poor optimization  *mechanics that feel like they were meant for alpha.  I do not recommend you buy this game but if you get it for free be warned that it will frustrate you and your friends to no end. I would recommend another dino game but sadly there are few. Still look else were when considering.,
Its kinda fun when it works, though about 6/7nth of my total play time has been trying to fix a game the studio is inept at fixing.
I bought his game with an open mind thinking that it was going to be as good as it looked, but I soon realized that moments after opening the game it took at least 20 minutes to even find a server. Once I finally loaded into the game it was very buggy and had multiple crashes on my PC, which is on the higher end. I tried to stay hopeful and use recommended settings and even lower than them, but it still kept crashing and I wasn't even able to play for more than 3 minutes at a time after multiple restarts and attempts. I would highly advise not to waste your money or time with this game, it truly isn't not worth it. PS. I came from Conan Exiles and would recommend that for a survival based game.
I tried really hard to like this game.  I've downloaded it twice, paid 50 bucks for it, watched a bunch of videos, and read every wiki I could find and it's just not happening for me.  Here's why.  I played this game during it's alpha and was excited to pick it up again after it received its full release.  I honestly cannot find huge differences between those two versions.  Take the building aspect of the game.  It is easily the worst building system I've encountered in any survival game.  In order to build some structures you have to find creative ways to "cheat" the system.  For example much of the terrain in the game is uneven.  In order to build walls you need to be able to place foundation pieces, BUT you cannot stack these pieces so as the terrain changes you lose the ability to extend your wall.  You can get around this by utilizing pillars, ceiling pieces, and wall pieces.  The crappy part is if you're playing this outside of creative mode you end up spending hundreds of resources on pieces that you have to destroy.  Some people will say well that's not the point of Ark, but if so why include building options at all.  There's just no excuse for a game to be this far along in its development cycle and have such a broken system.  I also found it funny that the doorways created are so small that your character cannot actually fit under them.  In first person mode you cannot see this, but in third person your character has the top of his head cut off by the door frame every time he enters the building.  It's just lazy design.  I think the evolving combat system is a very cool idea, but what you get before unlocking guns is bare bones.  The weapons you have access to at the beginning are incredibly weak and cannot kill the larger predator dino's like raptors.  In an era with games like Conan which includes combo attacks or the forest where you can parry block it boggles my mind that the melee weapons only have one attack mode.  Battles in the first phases of the game involve holding the left mouse button down and slashing your enemy over and over again.  The addition of guns really improves the combat, but the resources needed to produce them are huge and the metal needed to create them is most easily sourced in areas on the island that have roving packs of large predators that can kill your character in seconds.  The idea of training dino's is awesome and easily the best part of the game.  Riding a raptor around is awesome.  Unfortunately the amount of time needed to tame these animals can take hours for the bigger dinos.  A player must stick close to the dino due to the taming mechanic which requires you to continue to feed it specialized sleeping medicine and food to make it "like" you.  Again not a big deal, but I have been an hour in taming a dino when a T-Rex or a pack of raptors show up kill me and then kill my dino.  As I got smarter I got good at luring dinos into my base, but again base building is so stinking tough that it took me days to mine the resources to build the walls needed to protect your dino.    At the end of the day the concept of Ark is awesome and it achieves some really great things, but it has so many glaring problems it is hard for me to recommend this game.  I'd recommend Conan or the Forrest is you're liking for a truly engaging and fun survival game.
This game has alot of potential, but so far me and my son have found major problems with the game.  Please look at our hours on the game, as you can see we did play for quite a while.  The game glitches when transitioning into water, cave or land modes as there is a flash of light.  When we logged off, we came back in and our people were dead and no light to show us where our bodies were.  We lost all our loot.  Just recently, we were in the first cave and we died to poisoning from a mega-something (Looked like a lizard), and when we went back to our bodies the green light was there but no bodies and no pack sack.  We just lost our loot again.  A gigantosaurus was able to scale a sheer cliff as well as alpha rex on custon ark mode also.  So all in all for the price it is not fun to have to redo things because the game is too broken.  It is also unfair to kill someone in their sleep when they are not even on the game.  Look out gamers, hope you all have better luck and experiences with the game.
Game had potential, it's a pity it never left early access.
I spent countless hours now with some friends. The game is fun, but that FREAKING BUGS made me stop playing. The devs should STOP publishing content, but should rather fix the COUNTLESS bugs.
cave artifacts are not re-spawning for me
good if you have allot of money to waste. I dont so. Yeah. Also they wont fix bugs as much as they should...
Bad game. just like gta Loading to servers isa bish and official servers are unstable.  Not worth your hard earned money  NOT recomended
 devs are lazy and only want money
The game is broken at this time.  You buy the game and put in many hours into it and end up getting raided by people meshing.  
ass
Not for its current price. if they made the game $20 again I would recommend it.
the game uninstalled while i had my pc off and when i was not even near my pc and now reinstalling it has tacken more than 3 days
this game is trash dont donwload 
downloaded extinction adn bought the game with it, totally not even worthit, wont install dlc's nor launch the game itself, abosulte bull crap
Too many bugs and glitches, the developers have done everything they can to squeeze more money out of the players by releasing more DLC without fixing the base game.
FPS is so bad developers aren't listening to the community dont bother buying it unless u have a PC FROM NASA
its been 3 days since i submit ticket for character deleted cause of server rollback, but i receive no further information, smh
Thanks Ark for deleting my character after 2700 hours.  great news though they said they can restore it after a several week wait while they are fixing every one elses character as well.  bad news though base an dinos will have decayed by then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA   Devs are greedy fucking cocksuckers who give 0 shits about the players and are only interested in taking as much money of yours as they can without bothering to do any real work. Fuck this game and fuck these devs.
Bad 
Meh, most would probably enjoy this game however this reviewer coming from thousands of hours of modded minecraft, I was impressed by the graphics for about an hour, after a few more hours I was becoming bored. Ultimately uninstalled and went back to other games.
Cross Transfers killed the game. Simple as that.
Shitty devs that just want your money, they also ban people for pointing out exploits instead of FIXING THE EXPLOIT.
ARK: Mesh Evolved
This is my first review, and I am risking a ban to write it.  I will likely get a global ban just like everyone else who isn't pleased with the game, but I have never been know to do anything half-a**ed so here we go!  This company has a LONG and STORIED history of banning people who point out it's flaws.    First, the publisher you see in the top right is a lie.  Perhaps in Early Access it was owned by Wildcard, but not anymore.  It is now owned by a Chinese company called Snail Games and their name has been intentionally omitted.  Proof:  https://mmos.com/news/snail-games-usa-acquired-studio-wildcard-developer-of-ark-in-december-2015  For those of you unfamiliar with Snail, they are professional rip off artists.  This mystery shrouded Chinese scam brigade is responsible for colossal flops such as Dark and Light, and PixArk.  They have also been implicated in cheating on official Ark servers, but I will let you do your own research there as I refuse to send people to the toxic reddit community surrounding this game.  As for the game itself... Meh...it's a mediocre game with lots of unrealized potential.  If you are foolish enough to buy this game, avoid the official servers or you will catch a ban just like everyone else.  Play single player, or on an unofficial server and you will probably be ok (just probably, speaking out against it will still get you the typical Chinese gulag treatment).  The modding community has developed a ton of fixes that the devs are too incompetent to solve so definitely look for those.  What's the game about?  You tame dinosaurs and build stuff, so in that regard, it doesn't really differ from all the other survival games out there.  You can literally buy ANYTHING labeled survival and open world and it's the same experience.   The map (multiple maps if you are dumb enough to spend extra on the DLC like me) and game in general is poorly optimized, so expect a disaster.  Steam claims that this game takes 60 gb of space, this is also a lie.  I had to uninstall the game because it was over 200 gb and climbing as I added DLC so pay attention.    If you scroll down, you will see that there are only minimum system requirements listed at the time that I write this, this is the next lie.  It runs awful at the minimum, and throwing more expensive cards at it doesn't help.  They can't list optimal specs because there are none.   The game will BARELY run at the minimum specs, and my GTX 1070 can't run it at high settings.  This isn't because of great graphics either, it's just poor coding.  I have pointed out 3 lies just on this Steam store page alone...how many more do you think are out there that we can't see?  Save your money and give it to a developer that actually respects it's players.  The potential this game offered is why I have just under 1k hours at the time of this review, but that potential has already been squandered, don't throw your money down the drain like I did.  Go find the other game you were interested in, and buy it, and leave this smoking pile to decompose into nothing like it deserves.
One of my favorite games ever made if not for that money grab expansion tactics, admin abuse/destruction an maliciousness of public game run servers, horribly optimized in exchange for content that is no different than earlier versions sept repurposed over an over again to make pay to play content and finally making the game in such a poor way that it cost a small fortune to host a personal server. As far as sessions run servers their literally a piss poor joke.
After having followed this game from its inception YEARS ago, logging hundreds of hours at a time across a slew of different servers and witnessing update after worthless update, I have fully abandoned all hopes that the developer might one day start putting in any modicum of effort into fixing this broken clusterf*ck of a game.  Shame. It was almost fun, too. If it was left in the hands of a team that actually cared about the gameplay, it easily had the potential of being one of my all-time favorite games. Sadly, it seems that even to this day, it's borderline unplayable due to bugs and glitches that have been present SINCE THE BEGINNING. Not to mention that it performs so horribly even on up-to-date hardware that gunplay is barely passable versus dinosaurs, and outright impossible versus other players. Defending your base from raids isn't a thing, even you are lucky enough to be online when it happens. Thanks to this game's dogsh*t netcode, some of your shots won't even register as a hit, even if the blood splatter you saw told you something different.  Furthermore, it seems they're banning streamers and the like for exposing their game's flaws that, like I mentioned, have been present in the game for YEARS. I have no respect for this developer anymore, and no hopes whatsoever that they will one day address the many, many issues with this game.
Damnit Ark. You were the chosen one. You could have been the greatest sandbox ever created, and you blew it. I still love this game but it's so inherently flawed that every time I play it, it makes me want to play it less.
trash game
I used to like a lot about this game and what I did not like I brushed off telling my self "this game is in early access, give it time". After multiple accounts and over 10k hours im done being let down by WildCard. its been almost 2 years out of early access and the devs still have not fixed any of the main issues with the game. The story was dropped, the game play ruined by the latest DLC, Support for the games problems never happens, Devs are greedy and dont fix their game. game crashes constantly even in the main menu, trying to load into the game will take 30mins with with all the crashing. any resolution above 1080p and the game will kill its self. players are cancer, under mapping is a real issue. STAY AWAY IF YOU ENJOY STRESS FREE GAMEPLAY.  WILD CARD YOU REALLY LET US DOWN YOU WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER DIME OUT OF ME.
This game needs a major fix lag all the time on servers loading freezes game and thats not fun if a game dies that thank you
Globally banned on 3 accounts for? No reason at all i was playing with my friends minding my own business taking care of the wyvern, i got kicked and tried to rejoin it said "Globally Banned Code #" I tried contacting the staff and they replied with "Our bans are rightful and we will not bla bla bla bla"
Representation of how early access has become anti consumer.
All up, Ark is a great game with heaps of fun and heaps of teamwork. However after almost 650 hours in Ark, My whole tribe was banned after a new tribe member decided to mesh, I attempted to talk to support and after a month they only said "all bans are final". I don't usually write reviews however after hearing what happened to H.O.D gaming (youtube) and my past experiences ark deserves no sympathy.
My friend also got banned in this game for nothing. devs just seem like they don't care about people.
This game is absolute dog shit. Do not buy this game.
One of the worst online communities I have ever experienced.  Everyone trolls you when they know you're new.  The trolls troll you on pvp servers with everything from purposefully infecting you with something called Swamp Fever (incurable until you're high enough level to survive the areas that grow the ingredients for the cure), to repeatedly spawn killing you while flying around on a giant glowing dragon(?) called a Managarmr giving you absolutely no room at all to progress, all the way up to using horrible exploits like using pieces of building attached to dinos to allow them to hang outside of the world and fire at you without them ever taking any damage or even completely bypassing your defenses and allow them to clip right through your base to steal all your stuff.  On pve servers there is literally nowhere for you to build anything anywhere and you NEED to be able to build something in order to make the items needed to tame dinos (which you NEED to do in order to do anything in this game).  And where you MIGHT find someplace to build some troll has put pillars up everywhere that prevents you from building anyway leaving you naked running around with a stone pickaxe while the troll who controls all the land flies around on the dragon laughing at you telling you to kill yourself.  Outside of the community this game has some horrible issues with it (one was mentioned earlier in the review), one of which is a crazy exploit that's been around since the beginning (why isn't this fixed by now with there being several expansions out already??) that allows people to clip through the environment and they get to shoot you while they're completely immune to damage, or even clip through your base, steal all your stuff, and then clip back out completely bypassing all your base's defenses.  Another issue is that all the servers no matter where they are or how low their ping is they suffer huge bursts of lag completely crippling you in the middle of a fight or trying to kite a dino you're trying to tame.  Base parts don't like to align properly leaving gaps in walls, ceilings, floors, doors, and foundations allowing people to see what you have and even granting them access to some of your stash.  All in all I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  If it were just the glitches I'd recommend it with a warning, but mixed with the horribly toxic community this game is nothing but frustrating.  The only way to play now as someone new is to just stay a naked newbie running around getting killed every 5 minutes because you can't progress at all.  Trolls will destroy your bases and steal all your items and kill all your tamed dinos, exploits will get your stuff stolen from you without any chance at all at being able to defend it, or glitches and massive lag will get you killed during crucial moments in a fight leaving your stuff behind along with any dino you had out helping you tame or gather, only for you to return to your corpse having been stripped by someone else and your dino laying there dead and someone flying around laughing at you.
not worth
Five times already I have logged in after putting hours into the game and my character has been deleted. Don' get this game. Unless you want all your hours of work deleted.
It was an fun game but the constant updates with no addisional content was getting irratating.
공식서버에서 테이밍한 프테라가 갑자기 증발하는 버그가 생기지 않나 기껏 키워논 캐릭터 돌 사이에 끼었는데 스팀베리도 못먹이게 버그걸려서 죽지도 못하고 한국에서는 공식서버로 1대1 문의마져 못하게 막아놈 버그 ㅈㄴ많은 겜인데 그거 문의도 못해

They have no love for Video Games or their community, without whom, they would be nothing. This stunt by them proves it. Only when there's bad PR, do they care and respond.   "DO NOT release or work on DLC during Early Access" is the #1 rule of Early Access. This games deserves a better developer who would see it's true potential realised.
Dont waste your money
Deleted character due to global rollback.  My base will auto demolish before the support team responds.    I don't kill innocent babies, Wildcard does.  0/10
This game really needs to be more optimized. I can run new games on ultra quality but this one crashes on me like 10x a day.. its frustrating as hell
This game is NOT a AAA title and is not worth 60$, plus you still need to buy the other 4 maps!  The game is broken, they keep adding new content instead of fixing the problems it all ready has!   Servers are very very laggy with constant crashes and server rollbacks!   People are constantly suffering lost dinos, characters, buildings etc. NO INGAME support whatsoever! Tickets simple go unanswered!  Nothing but pure frustration, with very little entertainment!   I would like to start to see class actions suits agains WILDCARD and also the publisher STEAM for allowing such trash to be sold,, and being  promoted  and sold a a AAA title.  The gaming industry as a whole currently suffers from TITANS that need to fall.  Legislation is also needed to protect consumers from such predatory practices, and such broken garbage from ever seeing the store shelf! The game is worth 9.99 retail....not even a penny more!!!!
For one, it's a fun game with somewhat of a good graphics and a lot of features. However, this game's glitches and bugs are impossible to avoid. Me and my friend tamed an Argentavis that we had for quite some time now (meaning it's quite high leveled) and if just annoys the fuck out of me is that when you go near any lava, it will teleport the host player into the lava and whoever is riding on whatever creature would also teleport into the lava pinning the host player who's attracting them into the lava, resulting in everything dying. This is just stupid and the game developers can't seem to fix this so yeah, I'd rather use my money to wipe my ass after I take a shit than to spend it on this garbage. This isn't the only glitch they couldn't fix. Bugs such as getting stuck on rocks or platforms are a constant pain in the ass. You want a fun survival game? Get Subnautica Sub-zero or just Subnautica. Heck even Minecraft is a better survival game than this.
Shit game
The idea of the game is fun and the graphics can be beautiful, but the bugs that have been known and reported since alpha testing and still persist make me dislike the developers.  I'll be honest, if it weren't for their shady practices (DLC released before it's even out of beta?) I would recommend the game.  But as it stands currently, and with their recent banning of a youtuber that pointed out the flaws that have existed since beta, I find I can't recommend giving this developer any money.  I play, and will continue to, because I already spent the money and play on personal unofficial servers.  I will not be buying any new DLC or other offerings from Studio Wildcard because of their business practices.
the devs care more about money then their own players and community
Most broken pile of sh*t I've ever played but it can be fun but the amount of goddamn bugs makes me want to blow my f*cking brains out 
Ruim , péssimo , bugado .
no
Classic PvP launched, and I was extremely excited. However, like most new server concepts, the ARK devs fail to include their Oceanic playerbase and decided not to launch ANY Classic PvP clusters for us. Instead they launched 50 for EU and NA.  So over these greedy devs not considering there other clients that arent in the EU or NA.
Boycott untill the devs actuallly care about the state of the game, fixing the meshing issue!!!
fix your fucking game
don't
If you want the most realistic stress simulator ever created then this is the perfect game for you. My favorite part of this game is when my giga tries to hide under the ground but gets stuck down there forever. There is nothing better than waiting 2 days for a giga to grow, it is almost like raising a real life pet, except the pet has the lifespan of Anthem. The tribe battles are intense, the team with more Red Bull usually wins tho because the other team went to sleep. Easily one of the best things about this game is that size doesn't matter... a whole tribe riding gigas, no problem, Ill use this level 1 ptera to pick them up and drop them to their death, then spend the rest of my day hitting them with a sword because they are passive and I have nothing better to do but piss people off. Do you enjoy the lottery, well you have a better chance winning that than hitting someone running with an arrow. Really get it before its too late, its 5% off dont miss it! (DLC's not included)
Trash.
I spent money on this game when it was $20, and I use to think it was fun (I play it mainly on xbox).   But, what I have been seeing I suggest not to buy this game due to the devs only caring about their money and profits.
I have got over 5k hours in this game over 3 acc. I dedicated so much time all for nothing. got banned twice defending against meshing players and aimbot users. yet i continued to play. but when i lose the last 6+ months of gamplay to my very active server clusters getting taken down to make way for classic pvp servers. OVER 100 servers more than half have 0 players. Why not take down some conquest give us time to sort out new locations. Wildcard didnt need 100+ classic pvp servers maybe 50 conquest and 50 classic pvp and keep some players who will most likely not play again now due to this. for servers with half the content..... wtf this is rubbish dont waste time on this game not only will you lose everything to cheaters but the devs will also  screw you.  
buggy game, terribly optimized, devs are lazy and trashy, banning people for exposing bugs. yikes. glhf
The game was fun at the start. But hundreds of hours were ruined by hackers.
Shity DEVS. Do Not Buy
Utterly embarrassing.   It's truly a shame. So many games nowadays have so much potential, but it's squandered by greed. Make no mistake: greed is the enemy of gaming. 'Games as a Service' is a simple way for developers to maximize their profits by delivering lower-quality content in a shorter amount of time. I love capitalism and our beautiful free market, but I stand against greed.   Ark is a broken, clunky mess and has been since its release. Like Walter White, the company sits in its web of lies, constructed for one purpose alone: to make more money.
Bad game. Working like crap on i5 7400 @3.00GHz 8gb ram 1050 ti. I do not recomend at all
Devs pretty scumy
After my extensive time playing this game on official, unofficial, and private servers, my review comes forth. As a precursor, i would only recommend buying this game at a steep discount like i did.  At its essence, this game is a work of art. It is, all at once, incredible, horrible, beautiful, and riddled with bugs as far as the eye can see. You, should you choose to pursue the adventure within, will experience many things once inside. Feelings such as wonder, disbelief, and confusion await you.  Even though this game technically has infinite replayability, you can see everything this game has to offer within the first hundred hours of playing. That isn't to say that the first hundred hours won't be incredible though, as you will spend a good portion of it marveling and just how incredible everything looks, from the environment to the many creatures inhabiting it. This isn't without its flaws, however.  Being marketed as a fully fledged, high quality, competitive, online game ($110 for the base game and all DLC!!) is a joke. When you consider the content quality of the game, coupled with its near endless list of bugs and exploits that grows by the day, as well as the steep learning curves that players experience throughout their journey, and the vast amount of time you have to dump into the game in order to accomplish anything of merit; there is no contest. ARK ranks at the bottom of the online, competitive shooters out there today.  However, as a solo, or local co-op adventure sandbox is where ARK shines the brightest. When you take out the unrefined and buggy PvP (or even PvE for that matter) it becomes a much more enjoyable experience. Played with friends on a private server is easily the best way to play the game.Sadly though, even without the horrendous  online play, ARK is still a medium or low quality game at best. Unfinished base game content, missing items and recipes, and basic AI leave much to be desired for anyone looking for a good time.  Artificial difficulty is a common topic in video games, and ARK is a prime example of it. Even though the combat is marketed as diverse and thrilling, it really boils down to who has the stronger dinosaurs. When the best strategy for nearly every fight is "have a stronger dino and hit it until it dies" it becomes clear very quickly how to win the game.  Overall, I would give this game a 6/10 for having a huge amount of potential, wasted by the developers in favor of raking in  as much cash as possible. Did I mention that they made a copy of this game called Atlas and sold it as a completely separate game? Between the unfinished design, unbalanced online multiplayer, and ignorance of the player base you could say this; when it came to developing this game, Studio Wildcard brought a knife to a dinosaur fight.
Unbalanced and unoptimized. The fun can often outweigh the frustration, but the state is this game is inexcusable given the age of it.
This game isn't playable by people that buy it because people calling themselves alpha tribes raid everyone in other servers because you can transfer in servers and also they raid you with DLC mounts do not buy this game i wish i could get a refund lost 7 metal bases this month
First: When was the last update? Second: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
Ark is a piece of shit game and the developers are lazy people who dont give a shit about their playerbase.  If you want to go play pvp, go ahead. Build up on official servers. You are litterly wasting your time because in this game players can go under the map and, ignore all your defenses and destroy your base. It's pathetic and ridicilous that the developers have not fixed meshing in over 4 years. Even the oldest caves in the game can easily be meshed. If you dont know what meshing is, look it up on youtube. I spent 100 hours building my tribes Carno cave, and 3 days after it was done we got meshed. Great game. Nah this game is a waste of time. Go play something else and do not support these lazy devs.
This game just has far far to many mesh issues so i stop playing and tried Atlas.  To say that i wasn't impressed is an understatment! Wildcard you really have a lot to do to save your company and games. Fingers crossed that you can save your own games.
hardest game to launch, constantly crashes
lol got banned for the game.....  not sure why how do u find out why u get banned? i had a stone house just raid people. 
Spent 30 hours trying to find justification for the $50 pricetag, but never could.
The fact that this game company bans people for trying to expose massive glitches makes me never want to play again.
I loved this game before they released it..... then they started to knee cap the players. They took away alot of things people loved to force game play to how the devs wanted it. Speed stat on flying dinos? Nah yall dont get that any more. Like to go outside with out the whole tribe with you? Alpha PACKS just for you! This game is a shadow of what I bought. If you have a large group of friends and a your own server it is a fun game. you want to go on a publice server? Then dont even bother wasting your money.
---
my hard drive is physically heavier
The game play can be really fun! HOWEVER it seems that dev support is real lacking. They launched Atlas as a seperate title when it still has ARK menus in it, implying that they were originally going to sell it as ARK DLC which boy do they love shipping out DLC. And don't get me started on how they handled that one guy who reported a pvp bug, they outright banned him from the game! Absolutely livid with this.   Also personally speaking I had a 40 hour single player world, that was deleted in an auto update. So not even singleplayer is safe!   TLDR game can be fun but the Devs are bollocks
i dont reccomend spending a woping 60 dollars on this game, it soon after you get it doesnt let u play in some servers
Half-baked game being sold at full price. Even worse developers. Stay away from this and any other game they make.
Fun but can't play on a private locally hosted server for just me and my gf because that doesn't work for whatever reason and the devs have refused to fix for over 2 years.
If you have a lot of time on your hands get this game. If you have school or work then don't get it. This game is one of the most grindy games I have ever put time into. You put over 24 hours of time into taming, building, and grinding just to get raided the next day. I do suggest you pirate the game and get it cheaper with a steam key or whatever. Because the devs barley care about their own game.
Constant crashes. Unplayable.
I have over 3,500+ hours, so I have a lot of experience playing this game on Xbox and a little bit on PC. The issue with this game is the fact that it is not a solo friendly survival game. Meaning that if you want to play by yourself good luck trying to get far on Official Game Servers. This game strictly relies on teamwork and screwing over allies to succeed. My second point. Be prepared to get raided daily or even weekly. People in this game are very toxic and are usually hostile and aggressive towards others on PVP servers. And lastly an issue that has been in the game since release. Since release there have been game breaking bugs like duplicating items. They did this by DDOSING Ark's game servers. There has also been major game breaking bugs of people's bases disappearing or being completely wiped by either dinosaurs spawning in your base or either by random bugs that think your base is non-existent. And my third point. The major issue with Ark still to this day is a thing called "Meshing". It is when someone glitches through your base without being detected. They usually do this by meshing through the games barrier walls. "These walls you cannot go through unless meshing." When someone meshes your base, you basically get raided by players and you can't do much about it. People will mesh your base when you are offline for the night. They will even do it when you're online sometimes. Not only that but if they leave. Don't believe you're safe. Because typically they come back or you wake up the next day and you notice your base was destroyed by the same person or tribe. This game was very good when it first came out, but the game developers refuse to fix game breaking exploits and bugs. At this point the game has fallen off a cliff and into a furnace. I do not recommend this game to anyone, and I don't recommend spending $50 on it. Because I really wish I could get my refund on Xbox and PC. P.S. this game takes hours to grind on Official Servers, it's honestly not worth your time.
I have played this since legacy, The current stat of the game is worse now than then. This had so much potential, over 100 friends of mine have quit now. The devs let it slip away, Ive played solo, beta, alpha and mega tribes and now official is lost. The community only exists due to the fear of you losing your dinos and base. What a shame, I think its to late now.. by ark
Boring. Honestly, it's a decent game. It was good for my first year of the game, until they stopped updating. The game rarely updates and the DLCS are extremely overpriced. The aspect is perfect for those who would like an open freeworld game with little stress until later in their career within the game. Other than that, its pretty bad.
Save yourself the money and buy literally any other game.
no just no
Global Banning Scumbags.
good game(with potential) but shitty devs and littered with bugs! also they ban you for their own broken stuff (meshing). yes i am talking about HOD Gaming. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
Server problems galore!
Laggy piece of shit, that bans people for no reason, is littered with bugs and is just generally still not the game I thought it would be when i purchased it.
Review after playing this game more than 2183 hrs.  Great game for PvE, but PvP is so messed up due to meshing...   Spend hundreds of hours building our PvP base with perfect defense only to have someone going under the map and raiding you making all defenses useless…  Developers are sadly not taking this issue any seriously which has gone to the point where exploits have ruined the game completely.. Best advice don’t buy, but wait for the meshing to be fixed (haven't been fixed for several years, so maybe it never will...)  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
Let me start off with saying this game is great. Pretty much a must have for survival games fans. I'm still giving the game a thumbs down. Why? Because this great game is unfortunatly a buggy mess. There are many minor buggs that one can get over. These are annoying but not the reason I gave the thumbs down. The bigger bugs are. I think I have never played a save without encountering a bug that either set me back massively or outright made the game unplayable. Really dissapointing. The developers are also not very interrested in fixing these bugs but are rather busy trying to implement new things that can also fall victim to the mentioned bugs.  But don't take the thumbs down as reason to not buy the game. I really enjoyed the game and had many fun hours. If you are a survival games fan then pick the game up. I recommend waiting for a sale.
This is my first real game I ever played. I have about 490  hours. I found that the singleplayer version was good to figure out how things work in this game, but actually playing it didnt seem very appealing since I cant deal with the options to cheat. Just knowing that they are there and you can read about them on official ark websites prevents me from playing "fair", if you can say that about a single player game. So then I took a glance at offi servers. But neither pvp nor pve seemed appealing to me, too much grinding, taming takes too long. I also tried unofficial servers after that, but admin abuse. Its really hard to find the right server with cool people. Maybe if you manage to do that, Ark is nice. But personally, Ive gotten tired of it pretty fast. I might also be not mature enough to play single player, other people might handle all this freedom that Ark gives you better. For me its just too much.
Fix meshing
Game broken
Clearly there is a problem with the game，There is a mapping problem in your game.It's just a matter of time before it's built.If you don't find your own reason, seal the player number directly.

give me buttery smooth framerate give me a game that i can play for more then a fucking hour without a crash i don't even care about anything else just make it so i can play your shitty game and enjoy it for what it is, a half-baked abortion.  P.S drop atlas and fix your first that's still in a barley playable state. love you form jesse
Fuck this game. Login and get banned right away. No reason why you got banned.
Still after years of the game being out youd think they fixed the bugs, glitches, exploi8ts and more, but its the same game that was released in 2015, nothings chagned excpet the player base and its only going down, they take years to repsond to tickets you send them and when they get around they do nothing about it. only wayt to fix the game is to get another game company to take over cause wildcard is gonna kill ark soon
So what do I think of the game? Plain & Simple best game I've ever played other than the fact that the dev's give zero fucks about you & will let exploiters & Meshers destroy your Hundreds or thounsands hours of hard work, Think Im joking? No Im 100% serious if you play on the official servers dev's will no joke do nothing to cheaters. Other than that it's a great game Ngl  
Awful looking game, full of bugs, crashed several times, runs poorly. A PlayStation 2 game looks better than this game.
Developers banned user from multiplayer for demonstrating issues with the game in a SINGLEPLAYER WORLD. Unacceptable.  
Expose any exploits or broken game mechanics? Expect to get a global ban.  Funny I've had this game for 4+ years and its still not properly optimized.
shitty greedy devs, the recent issue wasn't the first one by far
The devs would rather ban people then fix rampant mesh bugs. I was on the fence about the DLC Atlas but i think this last one made up my mind, ill be boycotting this dev company.
wasn't this that game that made an expansion while still in early access? lol
dumpster fire of a game made by dumpster fire devs who couldn't give a rat's crapshooter about their players  would rather eat an entire horse butt than go back to playing this
Meshing is still a thing (since forevers). Untill they fix it i cant reccomend this game to anyone.
Game bans people for fixing THEIR problems and showing other gamers THEIR problems that they have YET to fix. Garbage devs, they don't deserve your money. Just go and buy another game, trust me its not worth it because at the end of the day if you don't get banned for finding another bug that these garbage devs didn't bother to fix then you'll constantly be getting destroyed by other higher level people.   TL;DR: Game broken and devs will ban you if you find a bug and show it to others and you'll get constantly destroyed by rival players unless you play singleplayer (Solo server).
bad
Ark = failed game Pixel Ark  = ark 2 = Failed game Atlas (Ark Texture pack) = Ark 3  = Refer back to Ark 2 and Ark 1 but ill make it easier for you guys and say failed game.   Ark's question after first game : How do we make a game and get money (Ark) Answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Dinosaurs and survival.  Ark's question: How do we make a money with not that much effort? (Pixel Ark) Answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Lets make the same game.  Arks question after second game: Ok we gotta do something different with this one (Atlas) Answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Lets make the same game BUT slap a new texture pack.  What I said in a nutshell. step 1: ctrl + c  Step 2: ctrl + v Step 3: Lets change the first and last word so the sentence isnt the same step 4: Enter
its a piece of  S.H.I.T game, always crashes after all that time spent downloading mods or even when trying to open the game. So if someone would ask me to describe this game , I would describe it as a piece of horrible ,undigestible  piece of  S.H.I.T if you want to waste money i advice you to buy this piece of crap game. Nor S.H.I.T or crap can scratch the surface of how junk this game really is . I went to go google a word horrible enough  to describe this game and nothing came up that at least satisfied me, so I am gonna make it my mission to create a word for it .  your happiest customer  me   ps: this games is a cross between a raw avocado,pitch black banana and some nasty A.S.S food what is at least four years old. please get that mental picture to understand what im saying. Then the C.U.N.T.S still wanna go edit the words i used out the poeste
It's never been polished. Terrible meshing issues leave huge vulnerabilities for players. The devs focused on cramming as much content in as possible instead of refining gameplay and turning it in to an enjoyable experience.  The game is a constant loop of tame one dino to help tame the next dino to help tame the next dino over and over and over. It's incredibly boring.
broken af!
I bought the game when it was still in alpha, and I don't think its gotten past that stage to this day.
Hello guys I have seen all what is chatting here and regards of this matter I believe ark they will not do nothing in favour of the players because for them after the new release all is no for them JUST making MONEY!!!!
Great idea for the game but realization is one big mistake. Laggs r like 30x in 1h, ragnarok is fully unplayable. No fixes for more than 3 years. Classic cash digger game, they r just adding new DLC for more cash. Our server is down for more than 14h so gaming experience is terrible. Also its easy to loose every fucking dino what u breed or tame bcs of lagg (sometimes dc) in rly bad timing. Never buy this game lol. Pure joke
Oof. I remember this. The initial experience was just so bad that I didn't play again. Don't be as gullible as I was to fall for the false hype the developers like to put out.
Personally i love the game but it is not the game that causes the majority of the issues, it is the devs, they hardly listen to the community and like what happened during the week I typed this a major pvp youtuber got globally banned for exposing issues with the game, the sunken forest in the Extinction DLC has numerous bugs and glitches you can't throw bolas and the map is in pieces i wouldn't be surprised if you can mesh in those areas. I don't have much faith into asking the devs to fix these issues.
Horrible game, I had in my library for a while, I deleted it a long time ago because it was buggy as hell and I don't intend to play it again.  The reason I'm posting now is because they banned the guy who's exposing all these glitches. Greedy company behind this game, nothing new.
HOD MESH FIX PVP PROPOSAL -get rid of the climbing pick -get rid of sleeping bags (change mechanic) -get rid of chair -make all mesh inside no build zone (center specifically) -no cryo while player is grabbed -no player picking on karkinos -limited building on para -sleeping bags can't be placed in enemy radius -no eating narco on pvp/narc grenades
Amazing game. Downloading this and updating it is absolutely horrendous. I tried downloading Arma, PUBG, and CS:Go. All downloaded with 0 issues. The moment I try ARK? Dead. 0 bytes/s all the time. This is horrible.
Awful game.  Dumbest devs in the history of game development.  Their idea of fixing stuff is introducing more broken shit into the game.  Stupid.
This.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
Trash devs, broken game that the devs are literally too stupid to fix.
waste of time. a lot of better titles and developers to support
They banned their biggest community creator for trying to shed light on bugs that have been in the game since day 1. Shitty devs.
Imagine banning a content creator for exposing your unfixed bugs.  The game is like Rust, but with lazy (or lazier) devs, a slow, boring grind, and a terrible community.   2/10
This game was the nail in the coffin for me on early access.  DLC before launch, price hike for buggy content, focus on content that makes money rather than fixing current issues/balance.  All this would be forgivable if the game didn't rely on one gimmick that gets old after a while, that gimmick is "woo hoo i'm riding a dinosaur", after that wears off the game kind of falls apart.  Every server at some point WILL degrade into griefing, which puts a ticking time bomb to any enjoyment.
All of my friends are playing ARK and I don't know why. I don't find anything interesting about this game. And my FEW friends are sitting and wasting thousand of hours on ARK.
I cant believe that you banned  Hod gaming for showing you problems wrong with this game i have been here since early access and i have not seen any improvements with this game at all meshing is still around which should of been fixed a long time ago and also i was here when you had the problem with duping which really didn't really get fixed. Wildcat you gotta lift your shit with your devs because  most of them are shit at listening and replying to bugs and other stuff this needs to fixed now otherwise the playbase for this game is going to die eventually
They banned a popular youtube player for showcasing bugs on a youtube video, which he did on a private server so did not affect other players. Bugs that have been around since this game released. This is not appropriate company behavior for an online video game. They should just fix the bugs.
The game fucking sucks. Don’t buy it, so many problems like meshing, duping etc. Such a good idea for a game but the incompetent developers just ruin it by completely ignoring these game breaking problems. But it’s like crack, so I still play it.
I liked a lot but I fear my joy is misplaced as a pipe dream. On the surface this game appears to have massive amounts of content, and it does certainly have that. However, exploring this content is challenging and frustrating. For example, I had about four hours of game time so I opened up Ark and decided I would like to play some PvP for a bit. I was having a bunch of fun, as an apocolypse server had just reset to day 1, it was the perfect even playing field.  Just as I had finally built a safe base and captured a level 150 parasaur, people start talking in chat about a chinese base made of metal with a tek generator and lv 267 rock drake (which was not supposed to exist and somehow evaded the wipe) they complained on reddit and the server got wiped. Then they banned a super loyal youtuber in typical burn the haters online fashon and reminded me that they are just utter garbage who only go to work for money.
in it's current state, it is garbage. don't bother until they fix the meshing.
Even prior to HOD ban controversy, the game was known for being glitchy as hell. Now, its just a proof that devs only care about the dollar dollar bill yall.
I have this game since 2015, i had a lot of fun playing it over these past few years , it’s actually one of the games i played the most in my entire life, however the game has gotten to a point in which it is unplayable because of how many exploits players are using to raid, and the fact that the devs do nothing about it makes it even worse
Full of broken mechanics and exploits. Absolute sorry excuse for a game.
Its broken and the devs are more busy silencing the ones who are trying help by raising awaness then getting the people who are exploiting bugs and ruining thousans of playtime for others. Dont PvP, and by gods, dont test bugs in singleplayer, could get a global ban for that, so do it on public servers instead, they dont care there..  Seriously tho, play alone or pve/private servers or enjoy getting meshed
Game has potential but the devs are complete trash, I do not recommend this game to anyone at this point in time.
Studio Wildcard banned a youtuber who pointed out the old bug of meshing instead of fixing the bug. Never ever gonna buy a game from them again.
If you're looking for a multiplayer experience of something like Rust in here, DO NOT buy this game or support the company that made it, as it is currently standing it is absolutely terrible for multiplayer, (enforcers) do not care about your tickets if you're facing a problem and will gladly leave you hanging for months before responding with a generic automated response (they don't actually read your tickets, and give you canned answers equivalent to a head nod), meshing problems became a meme in ARK when half of the people in a server live outside the map borders to stay away from harm, PvE servers are PLAGUED with Pillar Spammers (building foundations that render players unable to build anywhere near them) completely ruining the game, and PvP servers have a plethora of Spawn Point spammers that will instantly kill new players that attempt to join a server (including the beginner-PvP servers that are made FOR beginners), and the crown jewel is you either get ignored or banned for pointing out the problems of the game to the developers/moderators  Again, DO NOT support this unfinished game, your only hope is to find an unofficial server with a decent admin that isn't toxic and power abusing authoritarian.  Or you can just play singleplayer (which is  discouragingly buggy, broken and just feels unfinished)   PS: I have a GTX1080 TI with a i7-8700K processor, yet the game crashes every 2-5 minutes on DX11 due to the HORRIBLE optimization of this game (average FPS= 30-40 on these specs, I shit you not), the only way for me to play without constant crashing it is to downgrade to DX10, this gives you an idea of how horrible the company behind this game actually is    *Now I probably have to face getting banned for saying all this*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA devs are lazy and only want money
Broken game, it has been out for around 4 years now and they still can't fix the bugs that make the game completely unplayable. The devs ignore the root problem of meshing and only ban people that try to get awareness out for the problem, and their opinion on how to fix it. Absolutely absurd. Don't buy the game in its current state. Don't play the game in its current state. This shit company doesn't care about it's community or the game anymore.  
bad
Buggy game, awful developers.
Good private server, but for random multiplayer I can not recommend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
I bought this game a long time ago when it was still in early access. The game had been in Early Access for the longest time, and instead of fixing the bugs with the base game that has only recently been fully released, they spend their time making DLC so they can take more money from you. Not only that, but if you dare to point out how they're game is broken and doesn't work, they just ban you.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA&  This is the result of greedy, corrupted, and lazy devs who only care about money. Wildcard, learn how to take criticism and improve yourselves, or please just go bankrupt and leave us alone.
Banning player who brought light to horrific bugs. 10/10 would refund
It is pretty sad we are being stolen from by these devs they take our money and we get a broken game that have nothing but crashs that leave u guessing if ur gunna loose ur items or just fall out of the sky and die then race back to ur items again that is if they are still there and the devs response to this was we will give u pods to pod up ur dinos there the game is fixed ur welcome is the response we got from the devs and they expect us to be happy with crashing and rubberbanding for anyone who doesnt like ot waste their time and dont like giving ur money away for free then id suggest to save ur money and find a game where devs care about their players these guys are just going to take ur money and run
Love the game but cant recommend anyone buy it, the bugs are making things unplayable...official servers crash and rollback constantly up to 15 min rolbacks that will eat your items and hard work and in some cases delete your character. The devs keep adding more junk rather than fix the base game. If you do buy this trainwreck of a game play it in single player and you will probably have a better time.
Poorly optimised, full of bugs and glitches and the devs don’t care. Probably will never ever be able to recommend this game even if these issues are fixed.
Devs are conartists
Fix your game & Free HOD  Courtesy of SidAlpha (https://youtu.be/VTbetXoUgSg):  "HOD Gaming, a YouTuber that creates ARK: Survival Evolved videos was banned from the Global Servers by the game’s developers Studio Wildcard. The reason for the ban appears to be for HOD’s recently releasing a video showcasing “Mesh Monkeys”, people that engage in Game Exploits to the detriment of both PVP and PVE players."

I feel bad for everyone who spent more than 20 bucks for this game.And banning someone who points out bugs and glitches in the Game, does not resolve the issue, that this game has a lot of bugs and glitches. Since there is no more money to make in a game which does not work, another buggy and glitchy game has been released. So good luck with that one :D
Devs are unresponsive and don't address problems. Game has potential if they actually start improving the right things.
bad game, bad devs
Worst devs had a potentially amazing game, but more interested in money then the game they made sad and tragic
A game with a huge potential, but has awful and disgusting dev team behind it, so unless they change things, it aint going anywhere
The game has potential to be something great. Sadly, the devs can't be bothered to fix anything. From glitches, to fixing their maps so that people can't be meshing.  It's all too much work for them.  Rather than fix the problems, they took what should have been DLC; and turned that into another shitty, glitch ridden game.
Sadly as a company Wild Card has not done near enough nor its best to communicate with the community on game breaking issues. Third parties tend to view things clearly and I by no means am impartial after reading the stupid actions of a LARGE portion of this company. Including its enforcement, dev, and PR teams.
Having had this game since release, 3 different accounts (5000hours+) spending over $300 usd on this game. Not only do you charge over $100 AUD for this game and the expansions but then don't fix exploits that have been happening for years on end. Creating new games like ATLAS just to generate more income when Ark isn't even slightly ready for Beta let alone full release. An actual joke steam should be refunding people who have spent money on this shitty as fuck game. Fix your shit you bad devs.
If you're looking to play online, don't waste your time or money. With just about every move they have made over the past 2 years, wildcard has shown that they don't care about their player base.
your game is a buggy unoptimized mess and yall shit on your community consistently so yeah dont buy this garbage
Ark could be the best game in the world but instead of optimizing it with each update it gets worse and worse, it's a shame that they do not focus on this great game. #FreeHod Game breaking bugs that devs dont fix and ban creators for trying to point them out
This game is full of bugs which the devs are too incompetent to fix and the devs will ban players that draw attention to them.
i played ark from almost the beginning, the game is good but the game is still full of bugs and cheaters and people who use mesh to attack your base without any problems. and they can do it solo! and also devs dont care if you get raid like this! also they wipe you or the server, if you try to defend against ppl who use mesh to raid you! and also now they are closing the conquest servers for the new pvp shit. and lot of tribes losing now tons of stuff and can start again from zero! thanks devs i will deinstall ark. and i dont think i will ever play this game! and never wildcard dont buy and dont support this!
#FreeHod Game breaking bugs that devs dont fix and ban creators for trying to point them out
I LOVE ARK! don't get me wrong. but after they globally banned a content creator for giving advice i cant bring myself to give a positive review of the game. please wild card, stop making cash grab DLC and fix some of the well known issues that will make the game better for new players. i'm sorry wild card, i love your game but... #FreeHOD
#savefreeHOD this game need to be fixed i have played on offical 700 hours and they need to fix all the bugs save the game devs.
still buggy af
Trash game with bugs for 2+ years. People post about it on youtube and they get banned. AVOID IT.
Too many unpatched exploits in game. Devs seem incapable when it comes to preventing/detecting/patching the cheating.
I have not played allot but from the little time i have played the game just feels unfinished. The game is so hard to run, turning the graphics down makes the game look way awful.  The has allot of bugs still and feels like to me an early access title. I feel this  game had allot of hope, and i can see why some enjoy it. I personally enjoy a game that is more polished, doesn't crash and it not running horribly is also okay. The dinosaurs is cool and what makes the game special, but in my experience there are too many spawning. I know this can be changed in the server settings, but it should have been more balanced than that. Overall i cant recommend this game as the developers have showed they are not going to polish this game up.
Easily was my favorite game a while ago, now it’s completely obsolete with all the bugs and the meshing going on. Just wished the devs would finally do something about it. MAGA- Make Ark Great Again
The CORE gameplay is fun, BUT their are game breaking bugs/glitches/design flaws that destroy the balance of PVP completely. These are not new problems either and the developer actively persecuits people who point them out. Don't take my word for it! Google: HOD Gaming banned ARK. If the community didn't rally behind him he could of lost his livelyhood. BOOOOOOOOOOOO!
banning the biggest youtuber that gives your game free advertising over a video on how to fix the problems with your game. smart....
Trash. Ban a guy for pointing out your flaws, that your too lazy to fix anyway. RIP H.O.D
Greedy, scumbag devs. broken game.
Lazy, greedy devs. They deserve no money from anyone.  The game itself: After all this time still runs terribly and has many bugs. New dlc and games come out but this remains unfinished.
ban people for no reason and don't fix exploit and ban people for exposing it
They will ban you if you complain about broken game mechanics and exploits. 2 years now, and they still havn't fixed them. Just ban those who complain.
I have 3200 hours on this game and from my experience this game is a waste of time. DON'T BUY IT. The developers of this game don't do anything versus exploiting/cheating. This game will soon die because of it, you put hours on end just to get it wiped away in a few mins by a mesher. If you lose stuff from cheaters don't expect them to role back your server, or get you anything. They ignore you.
The game itself is a lot of fun. There are so many great attributes to it and I have a good time if I'm playing single player/unofficial. The biggest issue is the devs. They ignore game-breaking issues like meshing and other exploits, which causes PVP to be absolutely terrible.   Great game ruined by the dev team
Honestly, this game can be fun but its hella glitchy and not optimized at all. I feel like i wasted my money on ark.
Great game destroyed by cheating players who mesh and exploit the game. At the time of this review, the developers have not done enough to fix these exploits.
In all honesty, I have enjoyed some of my experiences in ARK, but the developers have turned me away. I could get past people offline-griefing my base and killing the experience, but the worst experience killer is developers pushing prices and DLC's for buggy games, releasing new even buggier titles, and punishing good people for supporting them. Unfortunately we have gotten to an era where game studios don't even want to foster a healthy consumer-business relationship. All they want is the money, and they don't really care about anything else.
Dinosaurs are stupid.
Youtuber tries to fix 2 year old exploits by making it public, gets banned by the game devs.
Untill Wildcard decides to actually fix the bugs and issues with gameplay DO NOT waste money on this game. Known issues used widely by griefers go unadressed and unfixed, while those that warn others of, again, WIDELY KNOWN EXPLOITS are banned system wide.  WildCard, you done f#$ked up.
Not only is this game unreasonably difficult unless you're in a toxic squad.  But the most important thing to know about this broken game and developer is that they are VERY anti-consumer. They will screw you over any chance they get.  Try Rust, it's basically this but with no dinos and a tad more realism.
Trash Can
I have been playing single player ark for the last year on PC and on Console (xbox360). I have loved the game initially but after years of playing many of the bugs I experienced on day one, I still experience today. If the devs had spent more time in the beginning on fixing bugs rather than adding new Dinos the game would still be awesome. Now ark is extremely laggy and constantly crashes on both my Xbox and pc. I would blame my PC or console but ark is the only game that I ever lag on. And I play ark on the lowest settings and on SINGLE PLAYER. I love the Dinos, the crafting, the taming, the base building and the boss fights but the game itself is broken and extremely frustrating. Give all of those ideas to a company like Rockstar or Konami and you'd have yourself an instant classic.
crap devs
How to ruin a promising game: 1. Release an early access game with a good concept 2. Ignore all user complaints and bug reports 3. Release the game full of bugs and exploits, ignore them and add more content 4. Ban everyone who tries to criticize you
Here because of HOD to be honest, I would of give this a negative review anyways. because of how AIDS it is.
After 12k hours of playing that broken game i quited because it never got fixed. It could be a very good epic game but new stuff is always released and sold but huges exploits like meshing and duplicating are a thing  in the game since the early access phase. Wildcard studio always said its early access but now more than 1 year after official launch of the game thoses exploits are still ruining the pvp experience of the game. Alot of farming, alot of time spend on a game losses on bugs its very frustrating. + another major thing, new content are never tested on a pvp view, sumtimes they creates huges exploits as n examples the mek  range  was way to far,  so its become so op that alot of players loses months of labor over a ''balancing'' thing wich is very ridiculous. THE TOS are applied the way its: if you have a teamate who cheat he makes the whole tribe guilty and deserve a ban. tousands of accounts are ban for a couple guys who cheats but cheating became a feature in ark survival since evryone is crying in forums.... oh true its the players who are toxic.... thanks wildcard ive seen enought of this.   So good luck it you want to buy that game... its could be an epic one but all the bugs n exploits and how the studio handle with it its ishhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Not worth more than $20 including all the DLC's. The dev team's behavior and how they treat their community/game is actually disgusting.   Not worth playing; cheaters will destroy months of hard work in seconds.   No point in reporting said players, most of the time they automatically mark your support ticket as resolved, without even reading it.   Only servers worth playing are unofficial servers that are not manned by the dev team, as unofficial servers have private admins that will almost always make sure justice is served to cheaters.
Buggy mess with developers who don't give a shit so long as they continue making money from it. DLC during EA, price hike, and now globally banning a player for pointing out glithes. Fuck these guys.
Buggy mess. Not optimized... seemingly at all. Devs sold DLC while the game was still in early access.
Banned a Youtuber for pointing out a glitch that hasnt been fixed in 2 years. Awful devs, dont spend money on this trash.
laggy glitchy POS. Shitty devs. mind as well buy a ubisoft game. how can they even call this game released.
Shitty devs only care about your money. They rather ban people who call out their bullshit for not fixing bugs that have been there for years. Also runs like shit thats why I barely played it
One of the most worst companies in history, just google the company and whatever you do, don't buy this piece of sh*t.
If Mr. Crabs made a game, this would be that game. Fuck you Wildcard
honestly just writing this cause they banned someone unfairly but this game is ban anyways so don't buy it
Do you like playing against people? Do you enjoy playing with dinosaurs? Well ARK: Survival Evolved is NOT the game for you! This game features game breaking bugs and glitches like: Dinosaurs dying randomly, duplicating and MOST IMPORTANTLY under meshing! I hope you like all of your precious tames and favorite dinosaurs as well as your base and everything you've ever worked for being destroyed by level 1 123s that don't even play your server, because that's what happens when you play this game.
Dev's ban people for pointing out bugs in their game? Fuck 'em.
After putting over 2,000 hours into this game on xbox and now hundreds on pc I think it's time I leave my review of this game. It has great potential, and in a time where so many newly released games have been disappointments it could of been one of the most popular still to this day. But the reason people have been here for years and still play everyday is the PvP aspect of this game. Sadly this is the one part of the game the devs completely ignore and rarely fix. I love this game so much and never wanted to give it a negative review, but due to the devs response to criticism and flaws in their game I just can't support them anymore. Once they lose the pvp community of this game their future games will fail, we are your customer base and you are focusing on the wrong parts of your game. Taming dinos and fighting bosses is why I play the game once, why I keep coming back years later is the pvp struggle. This game is dead and they want it to die, but some advice for your future projects. Don't keep adding content to a broken game. If the only map you had was the Island and it ran flawlessly, and you just added different server modes,  I think the game would be more popular and positively reviewed than it is now. I know you have to make new content to make money, but with such a broken game you just can't expect the fan base to accept it. And then you release Atlas which is another broken reskin of ark, I'm scared to see what ark is released as next. Good luck WC, but probably rip
Let me just preface this by saying, I believe this game had the potential to be the top survival game out there . However, if consistency will tell you anything, it's that Studio Wildcard believes more in pushing out unfinished products and content dumping (check Ark: Extinction and Atlas). There are bugs and mesh issues that have existed for YEARS with nothing done about it. Glitches abound, exploits are everywhere, and it makes playing this game with anything but a few friends locally completely null and void. In a game where they FORCE you to invest countless hours building and obtaining the tools necessary to thrive, the fact that these exist and have existed with the developers doing literally nothing about it except releasing new aesthetics for current content and new maps with even more issues you have to PAY for, is completely unforgivable. They even go so far as to GLOBALLY BAN content creators that make light of the issues. Fuck you, Wildcard. You greedy, horrible pieces of garbage. 0/10.
The game is alright. Single player is fun, multiplayer is not so good because of unfixed glitches. I would leave this a moderate review, but after the ban of H.O.D gaming for pointing out glitches(In single player too) I cannot do so.
Wildcard is bad
Game is broken and when people expose the exploits alpha tribes and cheaters are using, their biggest content creator gets a global ban.  Hilarious.  Stay away from this dumpster fire guys - don't give them another penny.
Lack lust game. the only reason I really put as much time as I did into it was to play with friends. The Company is also known for many awful business practices.  Really can't recommend ark, there are better survival/sandbox games.
Don't waste your time with this game.
Okay game. Awesome mods. Horrible optimization. Unethical devs.
I quit playing QUITE a while ago because of the "mesh" bug, which we called Map glitching back then. This was ~2 years ago... I see that they STILL haven't fixed it, and started banning users for calling it out... Shit game, shit devs. Spend your money on something better, like a stubbed toe, or perhaps a hammer to slam into your thumb.
Devs ban people trying to help the community by exposing glitches rather than fixing the glitches.  Don't buy it if you dont want to put up with progress being wiped by people glitching your base away.
fuck this game
At one time I would have recommended this game. But the bugs that never go away update after update have gotten out of hand.
Honestly the worst money I've ever spent. I not consider a development team that's this corrupt worth any of my money in the future.
Broken ass game. So full of bugs and glitches that when people submit detailed video reports on the bugs, glitches, and exploits that have been ruining the game for literal years, Studio Wildcard just bans them instead of fixing their game. Amazing.
Great game, if your looking for devs who don't care and losing hours if progress to bugs and glitches which have been neglected for years, even after large amounts of exposure and abuse.
Devs just want to suck you dry in between all the glitches and bullshit
Fix your bugs
PVP is bugged as hell. Has been for years and they wont fix it. Not worth the time investment.
Banned a user for exposing bugs on youtube
Fun if you have a private server with friends, otherwise I can't approve.
FIX MESHING!!!
I played six hours of this game and it was so buggy I left it to wait better times. Then you published a new game of the same franchise even though you still had this on your hands. And now I heard that you banned someone for pointing an old bug out that totally destroys the fun for others? I'm deeply disappointed in you.
disappointed by you lads
When i bought this game i would have 100% recommended it. So much potential and such a cool concept. Now the devs ban people for giving them extremely detailed video bug reports. Also that Atlas money grab thing. If i would have known this was gonna happen i wouldnt have bought this game.
It's a great idea and I had fun when my friends were playing, until bugs made it not fun. Official/public servers are something I wouldn't even consider because they won't fix the bugs that keep people from cheating. I wish this is a game that I could keep coming back to, but the devs refuse to listen to the community and it's made the game worse and worse. Can't recommend.
Consistent game-breaking bugs per session that have never nor will be fixed in the near future due to greedy developers who don't respect the player
Such a bad game dont buy unless you want your money to go to some greedy money grabbing devs that dont care about the game  #unbanhod
The devs don't ban players who cheat, and they ban players who point out that the cheating is happening.
Devs banned someone for trying to bring light to some of the game breaking bugs on youtube. Avoid this shitty game.
Devs banned an ARK youtuber who made a video to showcase a gamebraking bug in an attempt to get it patched. Absoulutely unnaceptable behavior for the developer of one of the most played games on Steam.
I've had this game for quite some time and have occasionally come back to play it. Unfortunately the Poor Optimization and giant list of bugs/glitches that just continue to occur eventually leads me to uninstall each time...  Come to find out now, that instead of fixing bugs/glitches that have been in the game for YEARS!!! They decide to start banning people.   Save yourself the money and don't buy this game. Devs have shown hostile behaviour with regards to supporting their own game, so why should we support them with our funds?
Devs don't like the truth.
This game is unstable and buggy. Those are most definitely the only reasons I don't recommend it.
https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game/ Devs solution to exposing problems is ban the whistle blowers.
Game has been unfinished for years. Do not buy.  Dev’s ban players who expose their bugs. Repeat, do not waste your time
Playing on official servers means resources and space is very limited.   Playing on non-official servers means 6hours of loading because everyone drops millions of mods and presets on their server.   Over all beautiful game, but really annoying. Needs a ton of fixing.
this game is absolute garbage dont even give it a good review its broken to the point you cant play and the devs dont fix nothing and ban ppl for pointing out how broken it is
This game COULD be such a awesome game but cause of the devs who don't bother fixing glitches It's becoming a dead game. For real #FreeHOD  And let ARK Survive !!!!
First of all i would not buy for $50 USD. Second devs don't even care about fixing exploits and cheats in the game they would rather put something new out to distract us rather than fixing their already broken game. If you are considering buying this game wait until the devs fix the game. Go to HOD GAMING to see how their devs act when someone brings up a huge problem in their game.
The game is perfect. There are no game-breaking bugs and the devs are nice, hard working, attractive people.   I DID WHAT YOU WANTED WILDCARD PLEASE DON'T BAN ME
Unplayable on public servers without getting griefed by bug exploiters. I rage quit too many times to count, due to stupid bugs (like getting stuck on a tree on a flying mount and being forced to dismount and fall to death and lose all items). Fun for a while but don't get too attached to your items/creatures because you will lose them when the game bugs out. Too frustrating to continue playing. Devs also ban players who try to bring awareness to these bugs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA devs are assholes and would rather ban a player for pointing out that their game is shit, than fix it. smh   enjoy the negative reviews ark
bad game devs=bad game
Used to play this game a lot but the lack of effort by the devs to fix game breaking bugs and now their pure censorship of people trying to bring attention to these problems is unacceptable. Do not buy this game, it’s not worth your time or money. It was an amazing concept with awful execution.
This game has so many bugs and glitches that have existed for OVER TWO YEARS. It's disgusting that nothing has done about it considering this is a multiplayer PVP game. Studio Wildcard is known for their shady business practices with ATLAS and ARK, do NOT buy this game if you plan on playing PVP
Bad game.
Developers banned a user who made a video being critical of game breaking bugs that have been around for years. Very anti consumer.
I played this sparingly a long time ago but didn't get into it. I wish now that I had asked for a refund. The game is full of exploits, and the dev's ignore the reports about them and leave them for literally years at a time, such as the ones pointed out by the YouTuber who made this video critizing the bugs and even offering ideas on how to fix it. He was banned globally.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA  This is how the dev's handle criticism. And the way the handle bugs is non existent at all. This is hard no for me, at least until they clean up their act and redeem themselves and fix this broken pile of code they try to call a "game".
Unban that fuckin' youtuber and fix your game you lazy asses.  We don't care if you wanna go work on yet another dlc, finish the half-baked early access dreg you havn't balanced yet.
FUQ wildcard.  They will take your money and instead of fixing the bugs in their game after 4 YEARS they will release more content for more money.  You are basically paying them to play a broken game so if that is your fetish then go ahead.  At this point, they have gone the way of DAYZ standalone.  4 years later and it is still a work in progress; just like the devs virginity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA if the devs are going to blatantly kill their game, then i am not going to play it anymore
After a while of playing and the complete lack of interest on the dev's part to fix undermeshing and other exploits, I'm done with the game. Once someone mentions the exploits and shows the developers, Wildcard bans people for it, INSTEAD OF FIXING IT.
Devs banned an ARK youtuber who made a video to showcase a gamebraking bug in an attempt to get it patched. Absoulutely unnaceptable behavior for the developer of one of the most played games on Steam.
The Concept for ARK is great, Everything else? Not so much, ARK is the Fallout/skyrim of Survival Games, Amazingly fun concept, poor execution, poor coding, shitty company. Imagine being told about a bug thats been in the game for literally years, so  you ban the person. Yikes.
Youtuber exposes glitch, gets globally banned.  Fix your attitude guys.
Bans players for using a Bug wich they know is in the game since over 2 years. 
Game breaking bugs have kept me away from the game basically since purchase and now their best content creator tries to get it fixed and they globally ban him. Another disgustingly sick and greedy video game company taking the fun out of what used to be an enjoyable experience. This company sucks like many others now. AVOID!!
Banning a YouTuber because they can't fix a game breaking exploit for over TWO years. Terrible and lazy company
Loved this game. Broken. Devs don't care.
To many issues to list.
This *was* a good game. I gave it a ton of playtime. Now they're banning youtubers for posting evidence of game breaking bugs that are common knowledge. These bugs already made me not want to play much, I was hoping they'd fix the bugs, but instead they're busy banning people who help keep them popular. If you want to know about the bugs search for Ark Meshing on youtube. Screw Wildcard.  #FreeHOD
I wish more than anything that I could be leaving a positive review for this game. As you can tell by my playtime, I've put a good chunk of time into Ark since I purchased it in EA. I was full of hope for the progress of the game back then, and I think the dev's were too. We had updates and new content frequently and it felt like we were listened to, for a bit at least.   Time passed.  The game has had DLC released and promoted before it's been optimized, something that was supposed to be done years ago, but we have yet to see. Game breaking glitches are ignored in favor of making the game look "prettier" with dino updates and patches that just add to the already 215GB of data that already clog up my machine.   If you ask anyone I know, they'll tell you my one true game love has been Ark. Dinosaurs and crafting/survival are pretty much a dream come true, but lately that dream has turned into a nightmare. Anyone I've met through this game have since left because of how poorly the dev's have been treating the game, and I am sad to say that I've become one of them. The lost people leaving Ark with crushed dreams and hope to find a similar experience with a team that will treat them better.   I hope to one day come back to Ark and find that it's been cared for and is a functioning game again. Until then, keep your money and look for a game better suited to players and not just their pocket books.
5000 h in this game , itz a great game but the suport is a shitt, problerms not fixed, if some one show them problems (HDO) they just ban him and dont fix the problems.  Really my Favorit game i every played, but also the worst suport i ever sow in a game.  I had to stop play this game, just because they dont fix bugs.  Im Pretty unhappy to leve a great game, but not possible to play with no bugfixes, mashers, and a stupid suport who alwas ban the guys who try to help fixing the game.   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA Devs pulled an EA Anthem and decided to ban someone spotlighting exploits.  How about fix your game instead sweeping these bugs under the rug by banning someone who has a passion for playing your game?  Banning a content creator (THAT IS SHOWING YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO FIX) is not going to make these game bugs go away or even slow down its use.
Too much meshing
The devs banned someone who whose them they needed to fix a bug and instead thanking them they banned him. Fuck you are. 1/10
Devs banned a player (HOD Gaming) for exposing exploits and posting it on youtube. Do I recommend? Nope.
Really ahve a hard time taking a critique  
TL:DR - Youtuber tries to fix exploits by making it public, gets banned by the game devs.  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game/
Glitchy, unoptimised mess of a game
>Release DLC as an early access game >Double the price of this glitchy POS upon release >World-wide ban a dedicated content creator because he showed game-breaking glitches that have been in the game for 2 years  3 STRIKES YER OUT
Bad devs ruin a good idea
A shitty game made by dishonest people who have no interest in making art and just want your money. Fuck you Studio Wildcard
Terrible. Waste of time. disappointing.
This game has a meshing problem and the developers have made several bad decisions in the past. They don't care to make a polished game. They just want your money.
Look up meshing and why you should not play this game because of it... Wildcard developers are apathetic but worst of all they will ban you for criticizing their game.
Devs have demonstrated ridiculously unethical behavior.
You might want to point out gamebreaking glitches, but Wildcard thinks you shouldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA lol
The game might be better if it was at some point fixed, but looks like that just isn't happening.
Never watched a single video of the guy that they banned but piece of shit devs = bad review.   https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/b5oxfl/hod_has_been_banned_from_ark/
broken buggy and never fixed
I don't recommend this game to anyone even if you have friends playing save them and yourself by getting them to play another game with you.
The game is a great concept I've played it on and off since release the only problem is the poor map design allowing exploitation and poor management.
The game is extremely bugged.
They banned a content creator on YouTube that was only wanting the best for the game and suggesting fixes for the games. I guess the Devs though it was just easier to ban him then actually do their job. Also another reason why the devs don't care: They're releasing so much content without actually finishing or fixing the content before. https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Seems like Wildcard has been doing some bad boy stuff in regards to fixing and addressing problems with this game.
Too many game breaking bugs. Devs need to fix them before I can recommend.
Devs are shitting on big content creators that actually care for this game. Havent played for a while and dont plan to.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
Banned one of the few content creators left for exposing a game breaking glitch. All around shakey development and unfortunately terrible development practices (DLC before full release, and changing Atlas to a full priced game from DLC) all around 0/10 user experience. Play on a private server with friends, and only buy it if its on a heavy sale.
I wish I could give it a recomendation but then people might not read it haha First let me say that I LOVE this game... HOWEVER Official ARK is a broken, salty, cancerous thing that is way too grindy and has WAY too many exploits. If you want to play this game and actually enjoy it Unofficial servers are sadly the way to go. There are Meshing(going under the map) issues, aim bot issues, and many other exploits to deal with, and the Official Admins are not responsive enough to deal with it. I run my own private, password protected servers that only my friends can access, and that is the main way that people can safely play this game. I have a lot of fun playing with my friends and by myself, but will not touch official with a 9 mile stick.  Also, get it on sale. Its a fun game, but its NOT worth the $60 price tag. I have found that most of the negative reviews are salty kids complaining without anything constructive to say, so please read the real reviews before making judgments. Have a nice day, don't get pickpocketed by a pego. <3
What a shit game.
meshing has killed this game and instead of dealing with it they ban people that dont mesh.  REally sad tbh was such a good game at the start.
Banning critique is unacceptable.
tons of bugs that are never fixed
Only worth playing solo. Online is very buggy/glitchy allowing anyone to break in and destroy any base with ease. Not worth the time commitment online.
Scummy Developers. Do not support.
Broken ass game with the same issues it had 2 years ago when I iniatially played it - I guess its easier to just ban critisism than to actually fix your trash game.
H.O.B Gaming.  I don't think i need to say more
For H.O.D. Gaming.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game/  The devs are banning users that point out ongoing, gamebreaking issues. This is unacceptable.
Good concept and fun to mess around with, but cursed with a studio that only does the work that's marketable, and doesn't actually care about the overall quality of their product.   Could have been great, but as is, it's just a buggy, unoptimized mess.
ARK can be a lot of fun but you can also loose 1000+ hours of work at any time even when you sleep. That's the name of the game but since you guys banned one of my favorite YouTube players HOD for exposing broken exploits that have been in the game since the beginning so I'm not recommending this game. Save your sleep schedule and play something else
It's okay, but recent issues and more importantly the DEVELOPERS ATTITUDE toward these issues and fixes is just sad.   Can not recommend this game, but maybe someday that will change.
The game has been riddled with bugs since release and though it is playable now I cant recommend in good faith giving my money to these developers.
The Idea is good, BUT... The Devs don't do anything against cheating and meshing (=Glitching under the World). Aimbot, meshing and other cheats are popular problems since years!
Devs are lazy and don't fix the game. INSTEAD THE BAN PEOPLE GLOBALLY. FUCK THIS GAME.
Banning a player because he's calling out your flaws, flaws that could have been fixed and should have, is ridiculous!! The meshing ruins the game, fix it!!! And bring them back!!
This game is an overpriced buggy mess. At close to full retail price you get a game that on a good system barely seems to run and on anything less is unplayable. I have 2 hours in this game and all of it was spent just trying to be able to play with two friends, which I was never able to do as one of them would crash about every 10 minutes. They "fully released" their game with more bugs than most alpha's have and have refused to fix most of them claiming their game is perfect. Studio Wildcard has shown they are completely inept at both game development and community outreach. They even gave a global ban to the dedicated content creator H.O.D Gaming due to making a video exposing some game breaking glitches that have existed for years. This game is not even close to worth it at full price, and is possibly worth a couple of hours if you can get it for free.
Amazing concept but administered by the worst development team in existence imo. Started as an early access title with the gall to release DLC for an unfinished game and charge 20+ dollars for them. While they improved on a lot of the core gameplay, the multiplayer is still woefully unstable, and fixing bugs seems to be an alien concept to Studio Wildcard, despite the desperate cries of the player base to fix them. Instead, they prefer to adopt workshop content as their own rather than produce new content. Even their new game Atlas is simply Ark with pirates-the textures and some entities are blatantly copy & paste. By all means, it's a game worth picking up...when it's on sale...for dirt cheap...because it's certainly not worth the prices they try to charge.

#FREEHOD
While I saw this gave having a lot of potential, after 4 years of overpriced DLC and a 'fully released' buggy game, there are much better options on steam than this garbage. These devs have some soul searching to do because they care more about public image and money rather than fixing their game for the community.
The devs globally banned a player for making a video pointing out game breaking bugs that have been in the game for 2 years while in a single player save. Fuck these dipshits
I don't see why people love this game, it runs like shit, buggy out the ass and is extremely expensive  I couldn't even get the shit game to join a server for the first 20 minutes, then for the next 10, I had the genuine buggiest experience of my entire life.  Would never recommend buying this game to anyone. The developers are garbage people that deserve their game to die quickly, yet painfully.
OMEGALUL Imagine banning someone for exposing glitches in single player that have been known for YEARS and the devs refuse to fix.  Hack job devs, dont buy this hot garbo game.
Could have been a good game but the devs only want your money. They dont care about the game.  Also connecting to servers, especially modded ones, is a nightmare and a waste of time. Probably half my playtime is trying to get into servers...
broken game that has never once run well
Terrible. Just terrible. The dev's ban their most famous streamer for pointing out bugs that have been in the game for 2 years and were never fixed. Disgraceful. Don't support companies like this.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game
Devs don't care about their community and ban players who are just trying to get things done for once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA  Lazy devs don't buy until they appeal the ban and update the game braking bug that's been in the game two years
Note to anyone who wants to make content for this game. DONT bring awareness to any bugs that have been around for years because the devs would rather ban you than fix the bugs.
You get banned for pointing out bugs.
Censoring critical reviews and bug reporting goes unaddressed
Devs are constantly ignoring and punishing the people who love this game the most.  Meshing has been destroying this game for years and rather than listen to HOD's suggestions Wildcard globally banned him.
game full of exploits, banned for no reason
Buggy as hell and devs don't care. Nuff said.
Don't publicize the problems with this game or Studio Wildcard will globally ban you.  Pathetic.
This game could of been the one to stand out but with dev's only care about making money and not on what fans want. You will found glitches that are 2 years old and haven't been fixed yet. But hi, at least they got you with these DLC that you could spend money on.
Very buggy, lots of glitches. Devs have stopped caring about the game. Do not buy this game if you value your time. It had great potential but greedy devs ruined it.
Would rather censor and punish people who showcase their bugs in hopes to make them more publicly visible and raise awareness than fix them. Upcharging and refusing to make improvements is the icing on the urinal cake.
Don't ban people cause they call out your shitty game for it's worst bugs that you haven't fixed in years. Unban HOD Gaming.
Devs refuse to fix long standing issues and will ban players for publicly calling them out on it.
Show or Report a bug and you'll get globally banned......These devs ladies and gentlemen...
Devs will globally ban you for reporting bugs.
Devs are lazy and cant fix bugs that have been in the game forever
Mesh Monkeys got me down.
Unoptimized and full of game-breaking multiplayer bugs.  It was a waste of my $26 when I bought it, and it's ridiculous to ask $50 for it now.  This game is not finished enough to have an expansion, let alone two.
Years later and it's still a buggy mess. Devs just recently globally banned someone for posting game-breaking glitches to YouTube.  They would rather silence you than actually fix this game. Let that sink in.
I did not enjoy playing this game to begin with, but the game devs decision to ban a player for exposing game mechanic problems after spending 2 years trying to get the devs to fix it is lame. Dont support this game.
Game could be amazing.  Unfortunately, the developers have no wish to remove game-breaking bugs and in fact will ban people who expose them.  Don't give these developers your money.
Might be a good game if Wildcard would fix the exploits that people have been complaining about for 2 years. Instead they just try to silence the people who point out the problems.
It's only gotten worse over time.
Has lots of issues, never wants to fix them. Can't recommend this game on any other basis except their graphics.
Broken game.
broken mechanics
Buggy
I bought this game and hopped to get around to play it. Unfortunately after recent news of a ban for exposing bugs, I have contacted support to request a refund. I know it probably won't work, but developers banning players showing bugs should not be allowed in the market, and Steam should honor that. Developers like this need to be removed from the gaming community.
bad devs
To many exploits shit dev haven’t done shit to help this game
Good game SHIT dev
Official servers are full of exploiters and hackers, devs don't do anything about it. The game has been released for a while now,but it still feels like it's in alpha. Stay away from this game.
How fucking dare you ban a player for pointing out that your game is shit. Since you clearly don't care about the right to free speech without persecution I hope you damn well lose your rights.   On record - bad game, only played as long as I did because I left the game running afk when I was asleep.
Wildcard is trash
Don't buy this game. PvP is a mess because the Studio who published this game is not developing it further and is not fixing exploits.
I tried to enjoy this game because it looked like a lot of fun. If you're only interested in single-player PvE and building then I think the game could be fun for you. PvP is a cheat-filled, exploit-filled, buggy mess though. There is a steep learning curve but it's not terribly hard to figure out what you're doing or how to do it if you give it a chance.  I only have 30 hrs of gameplay so my opinion may or may not be valid, but in those 30 hrs I gave the game a chance. I felt like I was forcing myself to enjoy it. There's a really good game in here somewhere, but the game feels scattered, incomplete and doesn't pull all the pieces together. I feel like the developers are trying to see how much mediocre stuff they can shove into the game while ignoring the core mechanics.
To be honest, this game is genuinely the worst game i have ever played. There are multiple reasons why i think this.  First of all, this game is terribly optimized. I have a nvidia geforce 750ti and i can run almost every game at 60 fps on medium settings without any trouble. With ark however, i barely reach 20 fps while the game is on the lowest settings and looks terrible. It also crashes every 1-2 hours. I have also had countless tames get stuck in the ground and die for no reason.  Secondly, the official servers are basically unplayable if your tribe isnt 40 people or you have a social life/job/school. When you finally start doing the fun stuff (raiding) your base will probably get wiped. Most unofficial servers are like this as well but with a little less farming.  On top of that, this game costs 60 euros and they make 20 dollar dlcs + a 60 dollar reskin of the game on top of it (atlas)  And last but not least, the developer team is terrible and does not listen to its players. For example, meshing has been a huge issue in ark for about 2 years now. It allows you to go under or outside of the map to build a base, store stuff out of the map or even attack bases from under the map.   Wildcard has done almost nothing about this in the past 2 years, so recently a youtuber named H.O.D Gaming exposed this issue and showed what it was (in a singleplayer game) in an attempt to help wildcard. Instead of fixing the issue, wildcard banned H.O.D's account.  I simply cannot reccomend this game to anyone and it is the worst game i have played in my life. Do not waste 60 euros on this.  
Buggy game and un-supportive developer.
Fix the meshing and unban your biggest content creator.
There are waaay to many bugs. I had my entire online experience ruined by them. 
Screw meshing
Banning a large content creator for exposing your broken mechanics in which you refuse to fix is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the community. This has been an issue for years and you refuse to fix. The content creator did not abuse the glitch in meshing but clearly pointed it out. Within hours, you banned them globally.   You are clearly listening but you don't care. Shame on you and shame on your entire studio/leadership for allowing this to happen and what I guess will continue to happen.
The game is buggy and unsupported by the Devs. Instead of fixing the issues in the game the Devs ban players who point them out.
I have played this game for over 15k hours, while it is addicting and fun, it is extremely time consuming especially when your fun is ruined in seconds. Your months of work can be taken easily by someone who wants what you have in the matter of minutes due to meshing, Meshing is where you can go under the map and see through textures, Your defenses become useless and they are able to destroy everything.. Even kill your tames that you spent days to raise. AND WHEN they finally get on to so called "help" they dev wipe the wrong people like GTJACK3D and they Globally Banned HOD for showing glitches that have ALWAYS been shown.  He gave out ways to fix this issue before getting banned and the devs decided to ban him 3 hours after the video was published. This is the definition of Dev abuse considering people who show these methods are the people who are trying to get the game fixed considering they haven't even attempted to for over 2 years now. They don't hear the communities cry to fix this and they only care about money. If you play this game, go to Unofficial or single player, officials are broken. If you want to play this game, be warned you are gonna end up wasting your time on it till everything is fixed.
Meh, game does not run that well. Even on decent hardware. It does not seem well optimized. Dev released paid dlc while still in early access.  Lots of bugs in pvp.  youtuber exposes game breaking glitch/glitches in ARK. gets banned. How about you stop reskinning Dino's and actually work on bugs.
Game was fun when I played it, but too bad you can't expose the games flaws in a YouTube video without getting banned. Shitty devs can't fix their game and then does stupid shit when they're called out for it.
Badly broken, no clear motivation to continue playing after more than an hour
If you want to waste days of your life just to get wiped because someone can get out of the map and destroy and kill everything without a problem, then this is the game for you
The concept, or core idea for this  game is quite fun. Unfortunately the bugs riddled throughout make it far less enjoyable than it should be. Considering many of these bugs have existed for a very long time. It is unacceptable that they still exist at all. The game is fun if you want to play single player but the moment you go online for the pvp experience. You're setting yourself up for frustration due to exploiters utilizing said bugs.
Haven't played it in years because it's so incredibly broken. Hearing it is still broken and now developers are banning for criticism so I'm just gonna leave a negative review right where it belongs.
too many major exploits that haven't been fixed for years and broke the game recently.
Banning players because they reveal game breaking glitches in single player in order to hopefully make the game better. Absolutely terrible devs, I hope your studio goes bankrupt and I regret giving you my money for this piece of shit game.
Dev dont give a shit about exploits! R.I.P. Ark !!!
Devs only care about money and the ban people who try to make the game better by pointing out glitches that have been there for 2+ years. Maybe if you fixed your game, the glitches wouldn't need to be pointed out #freeHOD
Great Game. Dogshit Devs; they ban their biggest content creator cause he tried to get attention to their huge exploits, and i'd wouldnt be surpised if i got banned for saying this.
Crap game, stay away wasted close to 900 hours just to be meshed over and over.
Barrage of bugs that can destroy anyone's work in the server
Unoptimized mess. Devs (Wildcard Studios) only care to ban people instead of fixing their game.
i have around 3.5k hours in this game.. the concept is good but the game is buggy as fuck.. exploiting is the biggest problem in this game  DONT BUY
Terrible game studio and there are 2 year old game breaking glitches still there that Studio Wildcard refuse to fix
I've had this game for years and eventually uninstalled it because was too much hard drive space and too clunky to play. I hear that the developers are prone to banning people who complain about bugs, which in my opinion is the same as stealing from somebody, so I'll just do that here. This is the single most expensive, regrettable video game purchase I have ever made. A great idea, and I want it in the hands of a development team that isn't these guys.

How can this game be 2 years old and still run like a massive turd. Not to mention that the download size is like 100gb, do not waste your hard drive space by buying this game.
Was always boring and buggy to myself, however, upon hearing about their incredibly unethical bannings of content creators I decided to leave a negative review! Huzzah! Don't give this development team any money, they don't treat their players with respect, spend your money elsewhere.
Do not waste your time playing until EVERY exploit is fixed. You'll lose tons of hours in the snap of a finger
This game has only impressed me in to ways breeding and dinosaurs the only two things why I purchased are both not all that in depth dont waste your money better survival especially game breaking bugs and horribly unoptimized. Dont waste your money!!!
Terrible devs, don't buy.
Still filled with bugs after all these years and the Dev will ban you if you bring attention to them rather than address it. Game is fine in single player, but anything online is not recommended.
one of the best gaming experiences I have had, but when devs start to censor peoples objections to exploits and cheating in the game can't support that sort of business model.
Garbage
The game is buggy crap. Not fun, boring, best use is as a sleep aid
Buggy + badly optimised game Get banned if you expose how buggy the game is gg Studio Wildcard
I have over 2000 hours on this game. I have been here from the beginning when it was released. The game was full of bugs and laggy but I kept playing.... The official servers where full with cheaters.... but I kept playing. 4 years later and I still regulary play the game even though ark has its biggest problem right now... meshing. You guys have not even tried fixing the problem but I kept playing. But the moment you ban 1 of the biggest ARK youtubers ,who has showed the game continious love and support, who has brought so many new players towards the game, the moment you ban him because he makes a video about it showing you guys how big the problem is, is just shamefull. It makes me wish i could take all the money I've spent on your DLC's back. Was interested in buying Atlas.... Not anymore. I didn't think Wildcard could go so damn low. I'd advise people to not sponsor a studio that doesn't care about your gameplay, they just care about the money and thats sad.
I tried playing but the bugs were getting to me, after seeing how the dev's react to criticism i can't recommend the game.
Buggy mess even after all this time
Too buggy and laggy and the devs only care about profit.
Devs ban players who expose bugs that just need fixing. Never buy a game when devs have no respect for their playerbase. #freeHOD
Buggy and the devs suck.  
DONT BUY..... the game in general is amazing but the developers got there money so they dont care to fix the game after 6 k hours in game they still cant fix simple issues
Free H.O.D. Gaming. This game is a buggy, poorly made mess.
They still haven't fixed the blatant bugs and glitches after 2 years.
Too buggy to play.
This company has formed a reputation for making poor decisions, ethically speaking. The game is also extremely buggy. Don't bother reporting the bugs, because that will just get you banned.
the current state of the game does not support pvp players.
Not esports ready
The game requires the you spend hours upon hours to get anywhere yet the developers refuse to fix bugs,that are two years old mind you, that allow people to destroy your work in minutes. It's very poorly optimized and the game has very shallow support. Would recommend as a strong pass to anyone that wants their time to be valued.
[h1]This is not a game but a lesson to be cautios and patient about games![/h1]  [b]This game was unplayable at early access release and on every occasion after that.[/b]  Just now they [b]banned[/b] a big content creator and youtuber that exposed a bug in ARK in an effort to get the devs to fix it. They banned him globally.  They also released DLC for an early access steam on [b]two [/b] different platforms (PC and PS4) while the game was still  in early access on steam.  [i]Glad I only paid 20€ back in the day[/i]
Full of bugs and optimization issues I spent at least half of my playtime just trying to get it to work properly for my friend and I.  This doesn't even cover the shady actions of the developers (DLC while still in Early Access etc.)   Do. Not. Buy.
Arks game idea is very nice and unique it has a huge potential to be one of the greates games. But the developers do not interact with the Ark-community. Thats the reason why the game is not getting better but worse. As example DLCs need to be bought to have the same chances on the offical pvp servers becase particular items can only be found on DLC-maps. (As having a lot of ark pvp experiance i know that it is relevant to have the items to be able to compite with oters) The game itselfs costs about 60$ + 20$ per DLC wich are about 120$ its to much for what u realy get:  Playing ark means u want to play mulitplayer becase the single player gets boring very farst. unfortunately the multiplayer got a lot of problems thow.  1. You need to spend a lot of time to make sure u dont lose your progess to raiders  2. You can not play as a small group of people becase you wount be able to compite with more people unless u are very skilled.  3.MASHING is exteamly EASY and allowes to raid everybase without contact to its defences. + No sistems to avoid or punish it  The KEY POINT is that the community tells the developers were they see problems and how to fix them. ( there were suggestions for every of my 3-points (yt. Kishko / HOD etc.) But Wildcard acts completely wrong by not listening and even worse banning people for showing up the problems. as in HODs case.  Overall i can not recommend buying this game for 60-120$ just to get extreamly dissapointed by losing hundrits of houers of work by people using exploits UNLESS you try to find a game were you can use exploits without getting baned for it.
devs are garbage, they ignore what the players ask for, which is to fix huge exploits that have been going on for years. Do not recommend getting into this game in its current state
Fix your bugs instead of banning people for telling you they exist.
This game had so much potential, but unfortunately fell victim to a money hungry studio with a quantity over quality mindset. I only have 50 or so hours played on PC, but played countless more hours on console. After almost 4 years, the game is still buggy and poorly optimized. Your money is better spent elsewhere
Awful game where you can lose 1k hours of progress because the devs don't fix under meshing
Refuse to put in real effort to fix their on game.Also show hatred to one of the biggest ark youtubers.[Globaly Banned Him]
Glitches that make the game annoying to play and a dev team that does not care about fixing the problems
WAY to much meshing going on here. should of stayed in beta
Honestly I would still give this game the worst rating possible, even if it wasn’t a steaming pile of shit... because the devs are. Stop making shitty cashgrab games and stop being shitty humans ☺️
Besides the fact this game is riddled with bugs and glitches which have been an issue for players over a period of years, the dev team decided it was appropriate to ban a content creator because they revealed this bugs in hopes they would now be fixed. Save your money, don't buy broken games.
Game is still a buggy mess, rather than fix bugs that have been in the game for ages they just ban people who point them out.
Do you like losing all of your progress because the devs won't fix well known bugs that have been in the game for years? Do you want to get globally banned for exposing these bugs through a system the devs encourage you to use to do so? Of course you don't, unless you're an absolute moron.
awful unoptimised pile of trash, I bouhgt this game and was stuck in loading for such a long time that I past the 2 hour refund mark having gotten in to the game the game was barely playable, many years later, and considering it's a mess on the Console, I made the assumption that the game will now run better on the PC... NOPE, still an unoptimised pile of trash.  Regardless of my personal feelings, Studio Wildcard recently banned H.O.D Gaming, why? Because he brought attention a Glitch that been in the game for TWO YEARS, to had banned him means they know about the glitch, but don't care, a dev that doesn't care about their game is UNWORTHY of your money and time, avoid them
Devs refuse to fix game breaking bugs. I paid $20 for this game when in early access, it's definitely not worth $60 at this point.  Do not buy! Devs would rather ban critical players than actually fix anything. Also, Atlas is literally a cut/paste of this game. Same menus they tried to hide but couldn't. Go buy Minecraft instead, or even Roblox would be better than this.
I heard we are now banning content creators who are trying to get devs to fix this mess?
Bad devs, banning a player for talking about bugs that have been in the game for 2 years.
Awful. Buggy. Expensive. Not worth the money, wish I could get a refund...
You have to no life this game to progress or you will get instantly killed by no lifers on servers.  People from later expansions that have better dinosaurs can transfer backwards to previous expansions and destroy you. You also don’t have access to the dinos so you can’t do anything but get killed/griefed. Essentially you have to buy the game and all the expansions if you want to stand a chance.   Overall the game is cool and would be fun, but you can’t beat no lifers or people who had years of dominating a server.   Wildcard also banned my fav YouTuber for exposing exploits that have been in the game for 2 years. He didn’t use them just showed how game breaking they were and needed to be fixed. So they banned him for making them look bad.
ARK: Survival Evolved will always be remembered as a , “what could have been” title.  What could have been if they, instead of releasing DLC you had to pay for during Early Access, instead just finished the game and provided you a finished product for the money you already spent?  What could have been if this neat take on the genre was in the hands of literally any other studio besides Wildcard?  I’ll admit, their banning of H.O.D is what inspired me to come back and review this trash, but this opinion didn’t fabricate as a result of that. This has been my take on ARK since I put down this buggy nightmare of a game years ago. Shame to see that not much has changed.   ARK: Survival Evolved is filed under the “Buyer’s Remorse” section of my game library for a reason. Keep it moving, consumer.
To many exploits and the devs wont fix simple holes in the map, which people misuse to destroy your 1000s hours of work. 10/10 would not recommend. They also ban people trying to get the exploits fixed, holes have been reported and publicly known, but devs wont fix it. To lazy to place a small rock in front.
I think it's so immature of the devs just globally ban one of their most dedicated players, H.O.D.  For those unaware, there are game breaking glitches in ARK that H.O.D. (a YouTube that plays ARK) showed off in a single player game. This is his only video really highlighting these glitches and they've been going on for so long. You can spend hundreds of hours in game and someone can come along and destroy your progress. Made me stop playing years ago and haven't played since. I might have 10 hours on this game? Glitchiest trash out there. The only reason I complain is because I bought the game on "version 1.0" in other words, the devs said it was ready for prime time, ready to release. Hahaha right. Trash game and maybe even trash devs.
One big NOPE  from me.
Not worthat $50 for a broken game.
I got this game in early acces and sadly i can't recomend it since the bugs that made me stop playing it in the first place is still there years after the release...
Meshing.
Buggy, devs never fix glitches. This game requires such high specs because they can't seem to optimize anything.  Careful about reporting bugs because it looks like they will just ban you.
Honestly cant recommend anything from this developer.  So many bugs and exploits, horrible performance.  Greedy company.  Do I really need to say anything else, we've all heard the horror stories.
dogshit - instead of fixing bugs the devs push shit dlc
Stop Meshing MeshCard
this game is trash and the developers are trash (:
Game is a joke.
Utter shit
Sad state when you ban someone exposing glitches that are old enough to be features now.
This game was amazing until a few years ago, Ark introduced this very strange creature called a mesh monkey.  This creature ruins the game as:  1.  There is no limit to it's aggro range, and it will follow you across servers. 2.  No building spot is protected against this creature. 3.  Any defences placed against this creature are considered bannable by the devs, which they will frequently enforce. 4.  There is little the devs will do post-mesh, even with video proof.  If you get this game, only play on single player or un-official, where server admins actually enforce reasonable rules.
Bad game and bad developers. Just a dreadful experience overall.
Banning someone for voicing their concern of the game bug (even though he did not exploit on multiplayer server) is unacceptable.
After 4-ish years since early access and 2 years of being a finished product the game hardly feels "finished". The game is a buggy, unoptimized mess to this day and the devs have proven they would rather silence criticism and move on to equally unfinishable projects before attempting to fix the game.
This is a game that had so much potential, but the devs have wasted it all to make a quick buck. I started playing in early access when the community was still relatively small. The game was incredibly buggy, but the devs seemed more concerned with adding content than fixing bugs. Eventually the game became too unstable to play and the devs didn't care. Now they are continuing their long history of banning those critical of the game. I know this game looks cool, but stay far away.
Apparently the makers of ARK are banning people for reporting bugs that are years old.
Developers made this game unplayable, they dont care of fixing issues of meshing and many other gliches/bugs.It feels like cheating is the part of the game. Would not reccomend buying it.
They just banned one of the best ark content creators GLOBALLY from their servers  for showing pvp- breaking glitches in singleplayer wich existed for 2 YEARS. Somewhat expected reaction by a studio that releases 60$ DLCs during early access and  selling a fourth DLC as a buggy standalone game (ARK Ocean aka Atlas) here's the Video that got this dude banned: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxxwnyFkuY
This game is trash DONT buy this piece of shit
Ark is unbalanced and way to expensive. Shit studio
Trash game with trashier devs that do not listen to their community.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF ITS FREE
Awful games with awful devs.  Read more here - https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game/
Total trash

No point playing a game with so broken official pvp servers
I loved this game but the devs are absolute crap. Meshing has been a problem since day 1 and it will continue to be. So if u put 300 hours into your base someone will just mesh it and take it down in an hour. Ive played this game for years to bad that I wasted my time with a broken game and corrupted devs. #FreeHOD
1. Cheating, exploits, and hackers run rampant in this game and the devs let them go even when given video evidence. 2. They adamantly refuse to do simple fixes for undermeshing exploits that would take no time at all to implement.  3. They have no dev for their PvP community.  What a joke. 4. They do not understand how to balance the game in the least and every attempt they make is offset by some stupid decision later on. 5. They sold DLC that was UNFINISHED before the  game even officially launched.  6. They have NEVER to my knowledge released any product on time. Especially DLC 7.  They ban you from the game if you make a YouTube video criticizing them. This proves the dev team is made up entirely of immature children. 8. Even when you send them VIDEO EVIDENCE of someone hacking, cheating, or exploiting they will still not ban them. 9. Glitches that cause players and dinos to fall through the map to their death exist to this day. This has been an issue for years and they have failed to fix it. 10. They give little support to any of their DLC after release, which is why everyone stops playing 1 to 3 months after a DLC drops and they just go back to other maps. 11. Their best and most popular map is Ragnarok which was not made by them. It was a Modder.  12. The Dev team has shown that they really don't care. I hope this bad reputation sticks with them to any job that they try and get in the future. I know if I saw that someone worked at studio wildcard I wouldn't hire them for that reason alone. 
Pass if you can. The devs released DLC for a game in early access and don't fix glitches because they already made their millions off of suckers. Do yourself a favor and don't give these thieves more money.
It appears the developers ban critics of their game.  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b62v0s/youtuber_makes_video_exposing_broken_game/
Just... Yikes
I had high hopes for the game early on but too many hiccups and mishandling by the developers has really soured me on it.  The gameplay feels bloated compared to other games in its genre, and with all of the bugs/exploits currently accessible and unfixed, I don't see myself or the friends I used to play it with getting back into this and wish I could have gotten a refund.
This game had potential and was very fun. However it is ruined by the constant cheaters and exploiters and the GOD AWFUL DEVS who refuse to make ANY changes to address the situation. They only care about pumping out dlc to get more money from you.
garbage game, garbage devs
Why ban HOD you trash devs, fix your game
ban one of their most loyal customers for exposing the flaws in their game.... right...... smooth move wildcard.... (talking about H.O.D) will not be recommending this game anytime soon...
Great idea for a game, I loved playing this game but it got to the point that it was unplayable when studio wildcard just is not doing enough to attempt to fix certain exploits in the game that can make thousands of hours of cumulative work between (depending on the server type) 6 to somewhere around 100, with the occasional few solos. But when there have been exploits or issues with certain mechanics in the game for years, and studio wildcard still has not been able to fix game breaking (for pvp) bugs, exploits, hacks. They are also not very on top of enforcing rules on certain servers which I find silly. I get the fact that it is a game through steam it is hard to find certain steam accounts but when it is shown to be the same tribe or group of people doing certain things with evidence to back it up through messaging apps, I think there should be effort put into getting rid of said people. When you ban your biggest content creator for trying to put out a message of what these methods to exploit are instead of fixing them... I feel that is the last straw and why I am writing this review at this point in time. If you are to play this game casually I would recommend playing single player or on unofficial servers with admins that actually pay attention. It is a great game that I love but i personally feel that the studio ruined the potential for this game.
Just don't buy it. There are so many exploits.
game have too much exploits and toxic community
You guys banned a highly respected member of the ARK community. His mistake was calling out Wildcard's shortcomings with this games design. Mind you perfectly factual in every way. You can Mesh in this game. That means in a game like this, when it takes literally thousands of hours to build, some random guy can bypass all your defences and destroy everything by glitching into the map and placing C4 beneath your base. Wildcard decided that instead of fixing this issue; they would ban anyone that has a large following for talking negatively about the game. Don't buy this game. WILDCARD DOES NOT CARE FOR ITS COMMUNITY.
Way tooooo much exploiting and just small bugs that could be fixed really fast but have been in the game for a good while.
This is a waste of time and money the game developers dont listen to the community and dont fix game breaking expliots but they still relesase dlc's any ways.
Hey there fella, how are you today? Good? Great! Want to continue doing well? DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! As a player with only a couple thousand hours in game I have already been aim-botted by popular youtubers, been teamed on against official 6man servers (against server rules), meshed, lost dinos due to being pushed under the mesh and getting killed. Guess what happened? Well i got killed by said youtuber, raided by 4th teaming tribe, lost my base, and my brand new dinos along with all my gear disappeared! But don't let me scare you away, you should know that this is an addicting game where the devs only care about money. I bought this game early on in beta and loved it! Because it was beta and the glitches were quirky. But then they released the first PAID DLC, BEFORE, they released the game to full release and still had just as many glitches. The reason why? They needed more money to settle a law suit. Then they pushed the game to "full release" so they could charge the full $60 of a brand-new full release game! WOW! Now whenever they need more money they release a new DLC. They did the same thing with their other even reskinned ARK game, wait shit, ATLAS game. Literally they copied all the files from ark, made them "pirate-y" and released it as a full-fledged game for $60 1-2 months after they said they would. (They had to release it as a new game because all DLC's would be sold/given out under their season pass so they wouldn't make nearly as much money) So can I say this is a good game? HELZ NAW! But I am addicted, and I will continue to play this game till I get banned because the devs do something crazy and ban me for some made up reason. (What got me to play this game) So while you have the chance, go find a game that works and doesn't allow Youtubers to cheat and get away with scot free. Don't support devs that only care about their namesake and keeping the guise of enforcing the rules. Can I recommend this game? Only if you like getting raped, stolen from, held prisoner, and have what little life you have left ruined. (No seriously, I had a good job that I had to quit because I was in a tribe that needed me to get on at a certain time, and my job didn’t fit that. So I quit and went back to serving so my tribe would always have someone online. Help me.)
terrible game full of exploits which the devs dont seem to care about seems like its just part of the game now unplayable at the moment till something gets done have over 200 days played and i had to uninstall due to all the exploits and bugs
This game has the potential to be amazing. The only problem is the developers constantly ignore and refuse to fix multiple game breaking issues. I’ve stopped playing for a while now l, hoping the “Meshing” problem would have been fixed along side smaller issues. I felt as a player, that I shouldn’t have to worry about getting meshed, losing everything I’ve worked hard to gather and build. Progression doesn’t seem worth my time, knowing an exploit can ruin so many hours of gameplay. After recently watching a YouTuber by the name of “H.O.D Gaming” getting banned for trying to spread awareness of exploits, I can say honestly that I may never come back to this game even if they fix their issues. Studio wildcard is throwing mud in the faces of all their loyal customers. Do not buy this game. It is not worth $60.00 at its current state.
Love this game, but c'mon, start listening to what your community has to say!
Rubbish devs rubbish game
Fix meshing #FreeHOD
it's bullshit how you banned H.O.D Gaming. The worst part is that they must have watched his video and instead of fixing the problem they banned him for making it public.
Meshers :)
mesh
The game is broken to the point that there ia no point in playing pvp. Devs dont care they made there money.
So our tribe have put 4-5 months in to breeding lines and building up on conquest, thousands of hours, real life sacrafices to be where we were till yesterday. Wild Card decided to wipe off conquest servers to change the current 90$ game in to the 20$ basic version and call it "Oldscool PvP" and give the people who play the dieing game 5 days head up? amazing... The game is broken in many ways, and the studio finally started doing things to fix them (Manas) but the main problem still there...Meshing. right now if you buy the game you have the following choices on official: - Go normal official with 1* rates (be ready to lose your job and social life) and be meshed - Go conquest for the remaining 4 days till you are ereased with 2* rates (sinc the announcement almost all of our bases been hit by meshers) - Go small tribes and be constantly meshed with the lovely 3* rates  and soon.... - go play Oldscool PvP with 2* rates with a fraction of the game you have payed 90$  And what happens when the community gets fed up and finally someone just puts all the crap you ignored for years to sunlight? You ban him. We still have a ticket we are waiting on when we have been meshed 2 weeks ago still no response on it we had video proof and Ps, yet when H.O.D. Gaming uploaded a video showing how broken the game is you just Glob Ban him? I'm more than disapointed
I love this game put about 5k hours into the game across all my accounts but the dev's are bad at their job they dont fix anything that is wrong with the game for pvp and for the community so i hope they fix their game so people can enjoy playing it with out getting meshed or having other exploits ruin their time
How is meshing still not fixed....
Game is way to broken Wouldn't recommend unless they start fixing things
Shit game, full of bugs, you need nasa computer to play.
Good game, bad devs
To many issues to call it a good game, the biggest issue is meshing and is mostly ignored. Studio does not care about its players and is not open for suggestions.
FIX YOUR GAME WILDCARD! WHOEVER WANTS TO BUY THIS I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED IT.. It's fun to play on private servers with your friends but in the Official Server..Bleh! Spent so much time to build base then Gets Meshed...
To many exploits to make online game play enjoyable.
Meshing is a huge thing right now Until they fix that i suggest to not buy this game. Also Wildcard is a joke
This game used to be enjoyable when meshing was hardly or non existent but now its out of control and Studio Wildcard has shown no actions of stopping it. This game is a literal waste of money at its current state and if they don't fix it hardly anyone will want to buy game from Wildcard. The only action from Studio Wildcard so far was banning someone who was exposing the flaws of the game and for that they can in every way fuck the hell off. #FreeHOD #StudioWildcrap
Really bad game. I couldn't join other servers.Why? BUGS!! Why can't I enjoy proper graphics? POOR OPTIMIZATION! Why can't I maintain a base for more than 3 days? ALPHA TRIBES AND MORE BUGS! It has tons of bugs,glitches and exploits and it's filled with Chinese bastards who exploit meshing techniques and make you rage quit. The grind is WAY TOO LONG. People have spent thousands of hours on this game only to have all their progress destroyed by others. If you don't have this game, don't buy it for now. If you have it, stop playing it. It could be the greatest multiplayer game of all time, but Studio Wildcard is just too goddamn lazy to fix their game. Hopefully after 3-4 months, it'll be reformed and they'll fix the game,but for now, DO NOT BUY IT!
Great and promising idea but very bad implementation sums it up. While this game is unique and full of potential it doesn't really achieve its place due to bugs that are still there since the early access release and other things  like duping and meshing. Do not expect anything like duo-trio servers here, they cater to zergs mostly and this shows also on the spinoffs this game has. Granted, they do try to fix things in some cases, but the overall feel of the customer service is not good to say the least.  Some people might argue that playing on an unofficial server takes away many of the unpleasantries but i do believe that a game should be enjoyable on its own official network. It really shows the work they put in doesn't it ?
Ark could be the best game in the world but instead of optimising it with each update it gets worse and worse, it's a shame that they do not focus on this great game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA
Not worth buying.   Full of bugs and exploits that have never been fixed. The developers also ban people who highlight and addreess these issues in public.
So many exploits. So many hours wasted. Devs need to be more involved with the players.
Fun game, but Official PVP is beyond a joke until they fix meshing. No point putting in hours of work on base defenses only to have them bypassed by meshers. Fix your shit WC.
Ark was "was" a fun game but over the past years has turned into a mess full of exploiters and cheaters. This game has so much potential but was ruined by the terrible developers of game. They have failed to fix simple and game breaking bugs, such as Duping, and Meshing as well as failing to balance the game with Mega tribes everywhere. They ban the people who support there game and reward the people who Cheat and exploit, do not ever waste your time and money on this game until the game is fixed.
Game filled with glitches #freeHOD
Don’t buy this game. The community behind it is trying to fix it for years and is being thanked by being ignored. They rather take action against people who have been exploited and who are trying to do something about that and for me it looks like they are encouraging cheating and abuse of game mechanics. This game is so full of bugs, but the support is disproportionately low. You will loose so much stuff and time because of this, that I can say it’s not even worth it. Don’t buy it.
Played across a few accounts for years - mega tribes, small tribes, solo. Official, unofficial - basically all the different modes / play styles of the game. It is really enjoyable at first, but once you get into pvp and late beginning/ mid game and onward. The glitching / exploiting / meshing is just undeniably present. With the game devs doing little to nothing about it, there have been countless reports, videos, exposing videos even explaining how these glitches occur and how to fix them. Video proof of some of the bigger exploiters in the community, and still they aren’t patched / banned.   Would not recommend for new players until the game is fixed - which based on the last 2-3 years of these exploits being here and nothing being done to patch them. I wouldn’t buy the game unless they make it FTP.
ARK has potential to be the best game ever created, but due to disgustingly out of touch developers, who refuse to fixed fundamentally broken mechanics in the game. This game seriously falls short. DO NOT BUY!
Don't buy this game. Period.
Garbage devs.
Trash game devs dont care about cheaters dont waste your money
DO NOT BUY They recently banned HOD gaming for showing how to mesh and told them how to fix it. He Got banned 
The game is awesome until you play pvp, theres a lot of exploits that ruin the game, and wildcard doesn't care about it, don't recommend it if you wanna play pvp. 
Devs only care about the money. FUCK you Wildcard for being retarded and not fixing a huge problem with the game. THEY WANT YOUR MONEY AND ONLY YOUR MONEY. People are Meshing(going under the map to avoid PVP defrences) and the devs do nothing. When we try to put word out about it, we get banned cause WIldcard are pussys and could care less if this game died out. THEY BANNED THEIR BEST YOUTUBER, one of just a few that still post about this broken game. FREEHOD!! Completely fucked up that they try to silence their best leverage all because he was explaining to the community how broken this game really is and how they can simply fix this meshing problem. FUCK WILDCARD
Half decent game with potential, But I could write a long list of things ruining the game, fun and entire experience, only to have the developers add on to that list.
The game is in an unplayable state, as there are many exploits that have not been fixed. Until Wildcard wakes up I do not recommend this game. #save H.O.D Gaming
#FreeHODGaming Game has too many exploits and glitches, Ark Devs do not care much about the hard work and the hours put in by players, by refusing to address such issues, they seem to encourage cheaters to get away with destroying months of work, they can easily fix it but for some unknown reason, they decline to take action and once they have your money, they don't care. This is in support of a Youtuber name H.O.D gaming that was recently banned just for exposing the exploits and giving constructive criticism, Wild Card needs to do better!.
I seriously hope wildcard starts paying more attention to there game and what there community wants then i might be inclined to change my review
i got meshed 2 times in one week, lost at least 6 months of work for my tribe in 1 day. if you like wasting your time and throwing away gaming time, then play this game. but you will get meshed and lose all your crap and the dev's wont do anything about it. free HOD
The game has a serious meshing issue with the terrain. You can glitch under the ground and destroy people's bases. You can glitch dinosaurs and bases into hidden locations. You can damage other player's structures while meshed, and they will be unable to fight back or defend their dinosaurs. I cannot recommend this game while the meshing issue is present.
Devs do not do enough to help their game. It has so much potential and it always has but they’ve never put in the updates it needs. Official is a nightmare
i have 5 thousand hours on this game and im quitting until meshing is fixed. listen to your players, its not that hard. 10 man servers, fix meshing, implement s+ beucase you guys dont know how to do anything correctly. Listen to the pvp commnunity.
Devs never listened to players, Meshing has been an issue for years now. You will build your base for like thousands of hours and it will get raided just minutes through the Mesh. Devs cant fix it or they dont care.
Honestly, put a lot of hours into this game across multiple accounts, played a lot of official, unofficial, and the Devs continuously give me reasons to give up, and I finally have. Banning members of the community for raising attention to issues, very corrupt Dev team. Wouldn’t suggest purchasing ANY game from them, just off the principle of what they will do to you, and the community if given the opportunity.
Pretty broken game dont buy if u intend to play pvp
the game is fun and entertaining, but the meshing and exploits are unbearable and make me want to quit ark. the devs don't care about your opinion and do nothing to fix the bugs and exploits. this is one of my favorite games, i have spent countless hours on Xbox and pc playing this game on official and non official pvp, but i'm always raided by meshers or alpha tripes no matter how small or big i get. i want to see the game and studio succeed, but how they act is unacceptable.  Edit: the devs have finally made some advances to make exploits at least harder to do, but there is still a long way to go. also the game is pretty badly optimized.
Has to many glitches/exploits to write a good review... solid game with lots of content but just cant see past the things ruining the game... the devs need to be held accountable for the sad state of this game. #FREEHOD
good game the dev are not they need to fix there sh*t asap
#freeHod terrible for what they did to @HodGaming
notice my low hrs ? thats becasue i was globally banned on my main as well still dont know why. Devs are complete shit dont waste your time.
DO NOT BUY THE GAME IS BROKEN EVEN AFTER 3 YEARS THE DEVS NEGLECT TO FIX THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE IMAGINE SPENDING HOURS BUILDING AND GATHERING LOOT JUST FOR SOME CHEATER TO GO UNDER THE MAP AND DESTROY EVERYTHING WITH EASE ANYONE CAN DO IT AS WELL THATS THE WORST PART AND ITS A SIMPLE FIX ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS REMOVE THE CHAIR SLEEPING BAGS AND CLIMBING PICKS BOOM THERE YOU GO WILDCARD FIX YOUR SHITTY GAME
Dont waste your time devs are complete shit. Have a good day !
This game has so much potential but the dev team have their heads so far up their ass I can't recommend it.
Dear, Wild Card Studios      Normally I would start by asking nicely but screw you, not only do you not listen to your community you ban people who promote your game and suggest fixes to your currently broken game. First you banned GTJack3d for building in an area that you failed to code correctly, then you basically refused to ban players who are hacking/meshing in your game. Now you have banned H.O.D GAMING for speaking up about how broken your game is in its current state. Wild Card you really need to fix the piece of shit game.  Sincerely, FUCK YOU
Absolutely deplorable to ban a youtuber that is pointing out flaws in your game, even more-so when said youtuber offered simple fixes for said flaws.  Censorship is the last thing any game developer should ever even think about considering, and the fact Wildcard jumped the gun immediately speaks volumes of their character.  I strongly recommend to not buy this broken mess, despite the fun you might have with friends in private servers, these devs don't care about you. They're as bad as EA and Bethesda.
A joke of a game. Horrible developers. Unresponsive and unqualified. Exploits that completely ruin the game are now common and most people use them. Worst $60 I have ever spent.
Very bad developing team.
dont play this
Do not Buy! Doesn't work.
The dev's took a great idea and ruined it with poor decisions. They allow cheaters to play on every server, and when they do punish a cheater, they just wiper their base and let them keep playing. The game glitches more than the matrix. The pvp in this game is awful. There's literally no way for a new player to build up 
Are you looking for a fun, balanced PvP experience? Well, if you are, I'd leave right now and find a different game worth playing. What. A. Joke. The most inept developers I have ever heard of.
ARK Survival Evolved is a great game but sadly it has some big issues. Do not even think about playing on official pvp servers as mostly everyone meshes your base. Meshing is when you exploit a mechanic to get through walls and under the map. It's sad but it's been around for a very long time now. If you do decide to play, play on unofficial in a community where there are admins that take action against this issue.   #FREE H.O.D.
THIS GAME IS SHIT. JUST FUCKING FIX IT.....
I have a lot of time in this game, on console and here. Not as much as some, but more than most. I can say in it's current state, it's worth a purchase on sale. The current full price is NOT worth it. Unless you plan on playing single player, or to a less extent PVE, I cannot recommend. I love the absolute dog s**t out of this game. It could be the best game ever made, but the devs just cannot seem to give it the support it needs. There is a huge problem with building inside the world (meshing) causing infuriating issues on PvP maps. There is a clear advantage to hackers, and friends of the devs. It's a shame really, there is nothing else like this on the market. Wildcard could have EASILY paid for their kids, and grand kids colleges if they had given this the right amount of time and effort. I will continue to play, and will HAPPILY edit this once things are fixed. But until then.
Do you like losing everything you've worked hard for due to exploits? 1000's of hours gone in minutes because people glitch under the map and destroy your base from the inside out? Then this is the game for you! Come check out ark! The game that is literal trash and has bugs/glitches in it that has been there since day one. I'm not even going to sit here and tell you everything, a quick youtube seach will tell you what you need to know about this game and its exploits.
banned my man HOD and cant seem to fix meshing and many other glitches
Not worth the money , too much exploiting shit game to be honest.
I spent well over 30 min writing a full story of my experience with the game(500 hrs in pc, 4k hrs in PSN), why i love it and hate it, i posted it, and seems to have not worked, so here it goes in the shortest way possible.  I love you Ark, you are what ive been looking for years. but your broken, have been since i started playing. Back when i first learned about cheating players, dupping, and meshing, i thought, well it sucks i hate it, but i trust wildcard will fix it, that was back in legacy, 3 expansions ago. more than 2 years ago since they officially released. plus the time in pre-release. this game has long had its chance to prove its the best game, but has failed miserably year after year, because its developers are not good, they are pretty confidently i would say, the worst studio i have ever experienced in my 20 years of playing video games. never has any studio caused this much grief on its comunity, from my experience.  And thats just the broken side that Wildcard can fix, do not forget about ddos, i experienced it and it was the most disgusting experience ive had in videogames. specially knowing that they cant really do much about it.  Back to the cheating, Dupping has been slowly been patched, but it never really is, there is always a new method being found, or should i said being leaked. because there seems to be countless more methods to 'be found". Same goes for Meshing, i always thought or so i heard from playing, meshing was when a player found a hole in the mesh, and would go in it, the rest was self eplanatory, in there they would go anywhere and hit any base, but what was exposed by H.O.D today was eyeopening, and the problem is just much worst than i ever imagined.  Your game is based on collecting loot-creatures, harvesting, and raiding for it, any way possible and any conflict that that may cause. since no loot is free, it all comes from somewhere, and all loot must be farmed, you have a consistent in game economy. That economy is powered by the amount of hours put into your game, and as long as meshing is here it completely renders all your hours put into this game into worthlessness.  In case you haven't noticed, the most valuable currency in the real world is human work hours, time is the most valuable thing any person holds, even when you are poor, and without education, as a baby you are truly valuable, for its the amount of time that you can offer to any aspect of life that determines your value. time=value time=ingamecurrency and when your ingame currecy which is time, is dwarfed by cheating mechanics in game (meshing) it renders all your time useless. and no one likes to waste time, even for people who think playing videogames isnt a waste of time, will think its a waste of time to spend it in this game. Im one such person, who loves videogames, and am willing to offer my valuable time to enjoy and entertain myself with these videogames. what im trying to say is until your game is fixed i will not play official, i love your game and i want to see it fixed and flourish, but until you fix it i refuse to play official, if that doesnt work i will refuse to play at all, and if that still doesnt make wildcard fix the game because of all its zombified virgin to the urgly truth players playing it, then rest assured that neither me, nor all others who have experienced this untolerable behavior in your games, will not ever support this studio again.  You have a chance still, your game is dying, even after dead you still have a chance to revive it, but not long.  # FreeHOD
One word meshing, im probably banned now
Been playing ark on xbox since it came out. This game has so many issues and dev's that just don't seem to care. Banning youtubers that expose the problems seems to be their answer to their games issues.
I Cant Support A Game That I Loved So Dear To Censor And Ban People For Showing Huge Flaws In Your Game. Legit Being Able To Easily Glitch Under And Into The Map And Raid Peoples Bases Is So Stupid Especially Since This Has Been Happening For Years Fix Your Game And Unban HOD.
Fix Mesh! Broken game!
Broken game with large amount of bugs and glitches.
#freehod Devs you are a joke fix your game before it dies out
devs are a joke better to steer clear of this game
This game has ALOT of potential, but they continue to ignore the things that make this game horrible. They have recently banned H.O.D Gaming for exposing meshing, I do not watch H.O.D but this should not be happening. People who mesh and team on small tribes are never banned, along with aimbotters, but H.O.D makes a video on how to mesh on SINGLE PLAYER and gets banned? This needs to stop and I DO NOT recommend  this game for anyone who wants to play pvp, but if you just want to play the game for its pve side, its a great game. This game has very good lore and is always entertaining to do a pve playthrough, but I would not recommend it for pvp.
Fix your game.
This game is now horribly broken I have over 3k hours played. PVP Has been wrecked under meshing has been exposed fully and now no base can be protected DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!
Game is trash stoo many exploits and devs dont care  
This game is a joke been out for 4 years and they cant even fix the smallest of things like meshing, instead they bring a new game out (Atlas) which is also shit and then when people complain and show how easy it is to mesh to address the issue they ban you for it even on your own single player map like WTF #FreeHod
joey salads where are you?
do not buy. broken game. been out for years and issues that were in beta are still a problem after release date. devs do not support community and ignore outcry. do. not. buy.
There are so many bugs with this game also including broken mechanics like meshing. There is dumb crap like getting stuck on abberation losing your character when transferring getting characters duped, meshing. I literally could go on and on. I have spent about 350 hours on this game I wish I could play more but I cant, I literally cant. These problems have been around for more than long enough for people like me to complaining.    #Freehod
Sad love story of an amazing game that slowly died, dont buy
Please fix your game its bugy. make it easeir to tranfer off aberation     #FreeHod
Not interested in buying games from snail games / studio wild card going forward how they handle the meshing exploits and not even address the gaming community about their actions.... Ark was a great experience for what it was when I played I don't plan on playing the game even if they fix it... but for the sake of not being a scummy company they need to fix these issues for the current player base otherwise they will be blacklisted by myself and my friends
This game was one of my favorite games and really still is deep down. It has many, MANY flaws though. At this point in time i would NOT recommend this game to ANYONE. There are 2 reasons for this. Ark, aka Wildcard has acted very childish and banned their #1 video content creator for their game for exposing the game for what it really is. Reason #2. The game has multiple flaws in EVERY map, mainly meaning that on the maps there is no where safe to build a base. Yes. i mean no where. There is a thing called "meshing". Essentially you get under the map and can travel anywhere you please. Multiple youtubers have made responses to this problem but studio wildcard has chosen to do nothing with it. Maybe its time for the game devs to do something about it and fix the damn game.
In its current state Ark Survival Evolved is not worth $50. Not anywhere close. The developers don't listen to their loyal community who continue to play their game and buy their many DLCs. The same exploits exist for years now and instead of removing the tools cheaters use to mesh they dev wipe and globally ban their Youtubers. 200 IQ.   Congratulations devs. You've lost a supporter with 3K+ hours, because I won't be playing this game anymore. And if you are a player like me you shouldn't either. DON'T PLAY CLASSIC ARK APRIL 2ND!
This game has so much potential but is actually complete trash atm. They added so much that they couldn't handle and it made the community really really mad. This is by far the worst group of devs out there. They dont listen to the community at all and they just keep adding stupid stuff instead of fixing meshing, a game breaking glitch that has been a thing since the game came out. Meshing is where people use exploits to get under the map where they cant be shot or killed and they can then walk out of it, into your base, past the turrets, and destroy all your work in seconds. thousands of hours down the drain, yet the devs dont listen. this piece of garbage shouldn't be at $50+ like it is currently. DO NOT BUY. Fix your game wildcard
#FREEHOD wildcard u really need to fix this game we all love so much it makes no sense not to. U fix we stop simple
For a game with a cost of £45, it is not worth it. Meshing is a huge issue in the game causing people who have spend 100s of hours to being wiped out with none of there defences being tested. This has been a issue for years now with no signs of fixing it. Along with more and more people learning how to do it and exsploiting it. I have around 1500 hours on this with most of the time being fun. There is no known PvP developers looking into fixing this issue only banning people they found have done it. And sweeping it under the carpet. With just  a couple of items to be removed to fix a big portion of the game breaking  I'm summary £45 for a game that isn't complete with issue that are know for years...
I bought this game when it was first added to the store as a pre-release. It is fun for PVE on PRIVATE servers. EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS GAME IS SHIT. PVP sucks, dinos sucks, official servers are terrible not just for lag reasons. But the amount of stuff that happens actively on official servers mind you are bannable. Yet they aren't banning the cheaters or anyone using a glitch. Wildcat doesn't care for anything more than the user's money. I am so glad that I bought this game for so cheap and so long ago because I would never have bought this within the last year.  Final Note : MOST games fuck up at launch and get better and better with each update. If they break something the devs fix it. HOWEVER ARK: Survival Evolved only ever got worse and worse.   Highly recommend spending money on other games not MADE BY WILDCARD OR EA for that matter.
Way too many exploits, with meshing such a serious problem I don’t recommend buying this game until these problems are dealt with. I’m not playing this game for the sole reason that if the devs don’t get a wake up call by the loss of players this game will fully die.
Excellent game but would definitely NOT recommend anyone to play this in the current state it is, check out H.O.D. Gaming videos on the broken mechanics, the dev team need to pull a finger out & sort all the broken mechanics out before releasing new content, only then I would recommend this game to anyone & everyone as it would then have the potential to be a highly played & recommended game. #Unban HOD
WIldcard is a horrible studio. Banning members that want to help their game. Good job #FREEH.O.D.
Wildcard sort you mess out u basically say u cant do anything to fix meshing how about not being lazy and do something useful for once
Meshing is a huge problem in this game and hasn't been fixed in years. Don't play this game unless you love disappointment and regret.
S h i t game
Wildcard doesn't care about players.
This could be a great game but due to the negligence of the development team to issues that exist simply because of their ignorance to pvp importance. After spending 2000 hours on this game I will be giving up, as will my team of 27 official players. Anyone who is looking for a good survival game, look elsewhere, this on is far to broken.
Corrupt devs, fix your game
Currently Unplayable. Support only for cheaters, I'd take a refund if i could.
Good community. Trash dev communication
Wildcard does not support it's community.
Studio Wildcard is social experiment 100%
They ban youtubers that want to help the game be better. Also they allow exploits to happen
Despite my hours, I will say that this game is broken, and I would not recommend. This game is fun under certain circumstances, but altogether this game has so many features, creatures, and variables but none of which are very polished. One of the main problems is exploiting such as aimbotting, meshing, etc. This is one of the reasons why I have quite official PVP and have started playing on either high rate PVP servers or highly modded servers. The base game itself is just not fun when all of your hard work is wiped just because some kid found a program that lets them aim without a care in the world or a tribe that uses a tuso to go through entire walls. This game would be amazing if it weren't for these simple faults.
Your getting a dislike for banning youtubers that call you out for not fixing your own damn game.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Very interesting and entertaining at its core, but poor mechanics and design encourage endless exploits.  Playing this game is a constant battle against cheaters and hackers who are free to exploit terrible game design.  Developers have ignored constant and specific feedback on how to fix competitive pvp gameplay.  Don’t waste your money.
Fix meshing and unban H.O.D.
Ridiculous. The game has been publicly tested by millions of hours of player time, and the absolute refusal by the devs to address the inadequacies of PVP and the abuse of meshing to ruin player investment leaves this game utterly unplayable.   Would not recommend for any new player. Regardless of your efforts wildcard will leave you vulnerable to their own shortsightedness.
I have wasted nearly 4k hours of my life on this game, I love this game so much. So you're asking why did I down vote it? Because it's terrible, deep down everyone has to eventually admit; ARK is failing. It's not even failing because of anything we as players can do! It's the devs, they cannot for the love of anything holy, fix their game. It's riddled with bugs, glitches and exploits; from duplicating items and dinos to being able to mesh anyone's base. The issues of ARK have been surfaced time and time again, but with very little effort on the devs part. Many people who played ARK have even done the work for them and offered up solutions, but their only response is to ban the players that once helped their game flourish. This game was a lot of fun and still is, but the issues are becoming more and more glaringly obvious and unfortunately, I cannot fight it anymore. ARK will die if the devs don't do anything.
I am mesher
Dog shit money hungry devs. Don't waste your time getting this game. They're too busy grabbing your cash to fix the broken aspects of the game. Feels bad though, they used to be relatively good at listening..
Until wild cards fix meshing official servers are not playable
The devs are the absolute worst I've ever seen, they dont care about their community at all, and have left this game in a ridiculously broken state since day 1. it has the potential to be the best game on steam, but instead ignore the ton of exploits that will cause you to lose your hundreds or thousands of hours of work like nothing.  Can play on unofficial as the admins try and pick up the slack the devs cause.
Shit game, allows people to mesh raid, Devs are lazy and allow all of this to happen. Then bans a youtuber who exposed them #FREEHOD
fix the game i just get meshed when try play
I Really enjoyed the game, but as soon as meshing became popular the game got unplayable, I still play here and there until I get meshed and then stop for a while. Thats why I do not recommend this game for everyone that enjoys the PVP part of games. Sorry wildcard but the ark community is dying :/
Shame, but i play PVE anyways :)
Totally Broken Meshing has destroyed the game.
 Banned the biggest cc for youre game over an easy fix to the game that everyome wants pretty ridiculous  Fix meshing its been around far to long !!#freeHOD
These Devs are a complete joke! they should be ashamed for banning one of there top supports for showing the problems they've been directly ignoring for YEARS! Fix the problems people show you instead of ignoring the people who paid money and put tons of time into it. Its a disrespectful and infuriating that these Devs continue to ignore there community
Hot Garbage. Don't buy this if you don't have an ssd with at least 130GB of space. I gotta 3GB 1060 that can run MHW at max. Pretty much max every game that isn't ark. Crashed while flying dead. Fixed the flying but then the water broke. Grapple hook underwater... DC'd im dead. Tek suit boost underwater... DC'd im dead. Riding megalodon underwater... Crash DC'd im dead. Swimming underwater while building a tek vacuum chamber underwater... DC'd Im dead. I guess just don't go near the water. The dev's should just remove the water and all water creatures. how bout no water period. Remove all flying creatures while yer at it because they're also busted. Might as well not be there if your gonna die just by looking at the beach. Niggas dying just thinking about going near the water. DC'd and eaten by a damn T-rex on the beach that spawned after you DC'd. Where'd you die? No one knows because the game is programmed to not tell you where you died if you died while dc'd. Bye Bye hours of farming Tek Shit. Monsters in the game tryna kill ya, people in the game tryna kill ya, the game just is killing you. Too much shit to worry about. I'd rather play literally anything else, or nothing at all.
This game its just  broken. Tons of hours you need to invest in order to "have some fun" and you can lose everything in a single hour. Devs never helps or answer. Sad this game had so much potential.
After all these years playing this game - official servers, unofficial servers, different kind of map from A to Z, i can clearly say - Ark DEVs dont care about community at all. ARK would be SO much more if DEVS actually did fix things which we are dealing against for years or months now. You play this game for days, weeks, months, hundreds and hundreds of hours just to get meshed and lose everything in a second.. And now banning your biggest support, youtubers, who are here, right by your side every day for years just because they adress THINGS WHAT YOU CLEARLY DONT CARE ABOUT FOR YEARS NOW.  Its just sad, i am sorry. Dead game for me. 60$ for devs who only need money and clearly dont care about you & your friends who play this game. DEVS - Your community is your foundation, dont treat us like we are hostiles trying to kill this game, we just want you to FIX THE DAMN GAME! #bringbackhodgaming
The devs are terrible, they banned their biggest youtuber for highlighting the issues this game has. Absolutely terrible.
It is broken as hell
If you like spending hours upon hours setting up a base taming creatures and exploring the map, only to find that someone has yet again gotten through the mesh and under the map to rpg your months of work go ahead buy it.   however for anyone still wondering about ark, i dont think you should get it, meshing is so common, and so widespread. but when actual players and content creators shead light to the devs on this they are the ones silenced and banned, the issues remain unfixed for years. simple simple fixes like removing the items helping meshers get under the map while the actual problems of players being able to do so are fixed. but no, the devs dont do any of this, and keep bringing out new maps with guess what, even more mesh holes/exploit holes in.   
Sad to say after 1500+ hours that I've completely quit. Can't think of a dev team that's more hungry to push unprepared DLC and ignore the community. This game is so buggy and glitchy, it's not worth even an hour of your time on pvp due to all the cheating wildcard allows to be a part of their game. Sucks because this is definitely a great game with a lot of potential but the devs only care about the next dlc.
I do not recommend this game. Yes i've played it alot, the game concept is really good, but I only really love what it could be, not what it is. It is massively broken, so many game breaking bugs and exploits and hacks. I bought it during early access and honestly didnt think much of it, it was in early access after all. This game is a good example of why early access is bad. The game left early access officially but to be honest it never deserved too. They only "released" the game due to complaints when then released a paid DLC while still in early access. And they kept adding paid DLC but never fixed the issues of the game itself, which is a shame because this could truly have been really good. But now it's a stinking turd you should stay as far away from as possible.
meshing/cheating is a massive issue on official servers. Arguably the biggest content creator for ark pvp was globally banned for exposing the meshing methods while also giving potential solutions. Such a shame to see a game with so much potential become such a disappointment. :(  if you're going to buy it, at least wait for it to go on sale. Its not worth the $50
Do not waste any time on this game.  The Developers of this game have proven to be cowards when it comes to responding to in game issues about people exploiting issues with their game.  The same issues that have been exploited for years honestly from the inception of the game.    If you are still thinking about purchasing the game, pause.  If you want to spend countless hours building a base, taming dinos, grinding for items, and being proud for what you have accomplished in the game, to, with little to no effort, have everything wiped by someone exploiting one of the seemingly endless amount of bugs with this game.  Then sure, proceed to waste your time and money.    There have been countless suggestions by many members of the community.  There have been petitions signed by thousands to have pieces of the game changed.  What does the development team do?  They release a new feature or DLC.   I have played this game for a little over a year, and in that time, the first and only major issue that comes to mind when trying to make decisions in the game is whether or not the decision we make is going to be ruined by someone exploiting a bug in the game.  In that same time frame, I can say with certainty that the population of the game has decreased severely from the already lacking amount of people playing the game.  I jumped into the game with people who have been playing the game for years, and even those who stayed loyal through all this crap have started to jump ship.    I'm not going to go into specifics about those exploits because at this point it does not matter what they are.  Anyone who has played this game or watched a video about the game can know exactly what I am referring.    In the end, this should, at most, be a f2p game.
after 7000 hours between my accounts. i can't recoomend a game where the devlopment team only cares for the next dlc and not the community or gamestate
Very good game! But make sure you don't criticise the flaws in the game or you will get globally banned from their servers.
I am myself a game designer is saying that this game is killing itself..... i was inspired from this game to join game designing but now... this game is my worst nightmare.  meshing imbalances bugs servers these r few major problems... there are so many more.  Rip Ark
Developers are shitty at maintaining their game and so the players suffer dearly from it.
MESHING and GLITCHING out of the map is a BIG problem with this game from launch  People spent 1,000s of hours building and taming   and in a matter of mins a MESH MONKEY DEV WIPES YOUR BASE FROM INSIDE THE MAP!!!   go watch and support HOD gaming for more details on YOUTUBE                         LETS ALL SPANK THAT MONKEY
Pain in the buttocks to connect to games
devs will not fix meshing problem. video gets made and posted to Youtube about the problem and the maker gets globally banned from game. its been out for years and still no fix. go spend your money on something else.
This game is actually fun, but when extinction and aberration came out it became a disaster. Everyone is getting meshed daily and dev's don't give a fuck about it. Don't buy it. Atleast untill they start fixing the shit they made.
If you're playing PVE go ahead, but pvp is messed up. People are meshing under the ground, and the developers aren't doing anything to fix it. It's insane. They are even banning people who are looking to fix the problem. HOD is a great example if you want more context (youtube it). Hopefully something changes soon, loved this game for a long time.
pvp is shit  Fix the meshing
Joke of a game (DO NOT PLAY THIS) The only way you can actually play this game is PVE, PVP is broken you build up for months for someone to get under the map and blow up your hole base in several hours what a joke. Not to mention Ddossing servers so you cant get on to defend your base, this isnt even the start now THERES GOD MODE GLITCHES like are you serious wild card????? Game developers are a joke and devs dont listen to the community. When we actually try to show the devs how messed up their game is you get permantly banned from the game (WATCH HOD Gaming new video)
The game doesn't run well, is glitchy, and requires a lot of repetitive work which feels more like a job than a video game. I bought the game and it took a whole day and one night of downloading to even be able to launch the game (symmetrical 100 mbps connection) then once I wanted to go onto one of my friends servers I needed to download a bunch of mods to make the game even somewhat fun to play which took most of a day. When I finally got on, I came to a boring uneventful and generally drab game in which I was horribly disappointed with. (And I can't even refund the game even though I was just downloading mods most of the time the game was running.)
It's impossible to play the game in Official PVP cause of all the Meshing (Players going under the map and raiding you). It's been years and the devs have failed to do anything about it. It's astonishing that the devs actually get away with this!
This is a PVE game only, PVP is broken and they ban anyone who says so.  Just google "hod ark"   #UNBANHOD
Broken Game Bans person for pointing out that you can easily Mess Than watches the entire video watching people mess and doesnt ban them DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT LIKE BROKEN GAMES WITH CHEATERS
Do not buy this game. It is glitchy, full of bugs, not optimized at all. You will experience massive loading times only to the have the game crash on you for no apparent reason. If you get passed all of that your base is just going be destroyed by someone going under the mesh (under the map) and popping up inside of your base to get passed the defences. I've had dino's fall through the mesh multiple times as well. No matter how good your PC is you will experience render spkes where the game is struggling to load in the next part of the map as you are moving across it. Nothing works the way it suppose to and we shouldn't have to figure out ways to get around these problems, however we had to because the developers are more interested in making new maps with same problems to get more money instead of fixing their current maps.  You've been warned, do not buy this game! You will regret it
Would be a great game except the Devs refused to acknowledge so many unfinished aspects of the game. Most importantly the game breaking exploit of meshing. It is a fun game but spending weeks grinding to become someone on a server just to have someone slide under the map and wipe your base overnight makes it a complete waste of time. I have been playing this game since launch on xbox/pc and there are problems that existed then that still do now.
Do not get this game I have about 5000 hours on ps4 on ark. Dont waste your money on this game the game was good but when everyone found out about MESHING the game went straight down hill you could have a base with 100's of turrets and someone could just raid you and shut down your whole base with about 20 or 30 c4 or rockets which would take the person MESHING you about 30 or 40 min to get this game is a waste of your time dont buy it  @https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qBzUd674aw                            If you dont believe me watch this video
I love ark but Wildcard does nothing 2 fix there game. meshing is so tilting there are many people who give simple fix for this problem so for me i like this game but wildcard you cant sell a product like this hope you get a big shittstorm that you already wake up so as for me pls FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME ALREADY thanks ^^
Good game shit Company don’t buy until they own up
Absolutely one of the best games that could potentially be played. But the ARK DEVs continually ignore the real problems of the game and make little fixes or add new features to take our minds off of the meshing problems. Do not play this game if you want a fair and fun time. You WILL be meshed and lose 100's of hours of work over a glitch that DEVS do not care about.
pvp servers suck
This game is severely addictive and can be loads of fun to play, has so many different things to do for all types of people, especially those who wish to PvP.  Sadly tho, meshing is so bad that it is basically useless to build a base anywhere with good defenses since people can just easily clip into the terrain and attack you without anyway to stop them without meshing yourself (which is supposed to be bannable) causing you to lose hundreds or even thousands of hours of work.  Basically ruins the entire game, would not recommend until it is fixed.
I have had great fun playing this game on sole, but after watching youtubers like HOD get banned for pointing out massive issues with messing I would never play official online. Needs Fixing
If you like to play on official servers then don't play this game. Devs don't do anything to fix bugs that cost players hundreds or thousands of hours of work. Meshing is a huge problem.
.
Mesh,MESHMESHMESH MEEEEEEEEEEEEESH 
They banned hod for spreading awareness of meshing. Plz don't buy this dying broken game
The best game with the absolute worst devteam! Banning one of their biggest contentcreators for exposing the games faults!! DO NOT BUY THIS PILE OF SHITE!! #FreeHod
State of Ark: For past 2-3 years meshing was a huge issue and it sill is. Recently one of my all-time favourite YouTuber was meshed. This game is beyond broken, so many game mechanics are broken, it's truly heart breaking to see. "Ark is currently full of players exploiting through the process of meshing. Meshing involves using game items and mechanics to exploit and raid other players. Here's my quick easy fix proposal until the devs can fix it at a deeper level.  HOD MESH FIX PVP PROPOSAL -get rid of the climbing pick -get rid of sleeping bags (change mechanic) -get rid of chair -make all mesh inside no build zone (center specifically) -no cryo while player is grabbed -no player picking on karkinos -limited building on para -sleeping bags can't be placed in enemy radius -no eating narco on pvp/narc grenades" From HOD GAMING 2019 Hod we are with you! #RideOrDieAsFxck #RODAF #FREEHOD
Do not buy and support this game. It  used to be promising game back during early access. Now it's a shit hole. You can't have fun in this game.  Too many unwanted dinos and broken game mechanics. Hard earned 10 hrs to 1000 hours resources and base gets wiped with in minutes to hours.    utter disappointment!
Meta? mesh. Devs? who.
this games meshing mechanic is so broken you can go under the map ignore 1000's of hours of work and rip it all down in under an hour i would not recommend this game until this is fixed #justice4HOD
Banning H.O.D for pointing out issues with ur game is a b!tch move    https://youtu.be/85CemXW6lPA
I had been playing Ark for god knows how long. I wasn't going to do this review until one of my favorite YouTuber's, H.O.D. Gaming received an unfair ban for pointing out the essential flaws in this game. (meshing) This game is fantastic when you are not on official servers. Ark Survival Evolved is littered with more bugs and exploits than an ant colony doped up on sugar. The developers have yet to take care of the most basic game-breaking bugs that have existed for over three years! The developer's of Ark Survival Evolved silence and ban dissenters who point out the games most critical design flaws. These critical flaws are destroying the game! The actions that Wildcard has chosen to stop new players from seeing the truth about this game are communistic at best. If you want to waste your life grinding for resources only to have a bunch of hackers and cheaters destroy everything you worked for in seconds, by all accords pay the overpriced fee for the game and kiss your hard earned money goodbye. If you want to be involved in a community where the developers encourage cheating and profit off of it; buy this game. If you want to have a positive experience for a reasonable price; DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I'm telling you as the developers of this game only care about how many copies of this game you will buy. They do not care about fixing their buggy, unpolished game. They will ban with prejudice anyone who talks ill about the game or anyone who gets in the way of their scheme to force players to buy as many copies of Ark as possible through their unjustified banning decisions. For $60 or 100 dollars if you buy the DLC, you can buy another game that is so much better. The developers have given up on the improvement of the game. Why should you support them?
By far one of the worst games I've ever played in my life. Meshing and exploitation of this game runs rampant with little to no repercussions to the offenders. After losing my character that I had sunk countless hours into leveling up, due to a server rollback by the terrible team that runs this game, I contacted customer support. They were absolutely no help and offered very little in compensation. They do not care about their player base in the slightest. I would not recommend this pile of garbage to anyone. Also, they silence those who speak critically of their game. As evident by the recent banning of one of their largest youtubers who had the audacity to speak out against the issues this game possess.
DON'T BUY THIS GAME,  If you are planning on playing Official servers just don't. The game is plagued by cheaters & meshers (people who just ignore your entire bases defences while sitting under the map). all servers are full of teamers so if u play 6 man servers and you go raiding you play a 6v12 most of the time. The developers are more focused on making insanely unbalanced maps and dinos (extinction) which are pretty much pay2win. if they are not busy making unbalanced mods they are banning members of the community that are simply trying to better the game (Youtuber HOD is a great example he got globally banned for exposing ways to get under the map while wildcard just refuses to fix the thing that's straight up killing their game.   HOWEVER The game is unique and kind of rustlike (altho id say rust is a better game) and you will not find anything like it anytime soon. if u plan on playing unofficial or PVE the game is a great timedump and can be realy great to play with friends and just slowly progress. the game is realy fun to play solo and just mess with people or become the biggest group on your server and dominate. However this comes with a MASSIVE IF, if your group is not enjoyable to play with this can completely and utterly ruin your game experience and i suggest you just move on from them,   in summary,  if you play this game steer clear of Official server, they are just not worth your time. if you have friends to play with it can be a whole lot of fun. The game has really high highs and insanely low lows. The devs don't care in the slightest about this game (it seems) and have been refusing to fix the biggest problems in the game for over 2 years. if you want a good survival game....  do yourself a favor and buy Rust   
This game could have been great but it's not. lack of support the grinding hours that it takes together stuff and then a hacker comes by a cleans your base because he can. you can post video and what not and the developers won't do anything about it they got their money already. horrible game just walk away even from their new game atlas
I have nearly 5k hours on this game and honestly is it not worth spending 60$+ on this game in its current state. The game was fun during the first and half years but those times are gone. To many bugs/exploits(STILL) that aren't being fixed or looked at and the game has been out for more that 3 years going on to its 4th. at this point the devs dont really care about fixing their game they'll fixed it if once they feel like it and who knows when that will happen   if you want to pay for a game that is 60$ which was once 20$-30$ in the first year
Add few mods, mess with server settings and you`ll get best SP survival game on market.   Except the fact some bugs will never be fixed and devs playing deafs.  If you like constant crashes, stupid ai of your dinos, some dinos does not spawn at all, falling dinos into floor, not respawning cave drops and stuff like this, game is for you.  I will still play but all that makes me sick so thumbs down wilcard
dogshit game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA devs are lazy and only want money
Honestly one of the worst games i have ever played  the lag is unreal and they just keep adding more maps and dinos and the developers dont even care about the lag or any of the bugs it has like the registration for the flyers you will shoot them 100 times and the arrows wont register at all  
HAHAHAHA, no.
game make want die
bugy as shit.... also playing pvp is just getting ur butt wiped until someday by a chance of 1 in a billion u get a lil bigger and get like a mana or shit. And even then u still get wiped so all in all: shit  
Pretty fun game to play.  But after all these updates the game just gotten worse somewhat :/ Don't missunderstand i still love the game <3 but it has changed so much :/ 3/10 from me (had the game since when it came out)
Don't do many reviews, so will keep it short.  Little mixed on this game. Although I do enjoy the graphics and game play. Not enthused that ijn order to play ARK with my friends on other platforms. I would have to buy it for each platform. Part of me is regretting the purchase. As RUST to me, is just as good of a game. In over all perspective. If you plan to get this play with your friends. It is great to do if you and them are all on the same platform. Otherwise, the game quickly gets boring. Many sandbox builders out there that are cheaper and many that are free with similar game play. So it's hard to say I would recommend this game or not. Depends on if everyone or most everyone you know is on steam.
over 100gb game?! WTF....
Logged 300 hours onto this game over the course of 2 years and i have to say it can be great but terrible. Me and my friend constantly like to play just by ourselves on a non-dedicated sever and quite literally every time we connect to each other the session will time out or the game with crash for whatever reason. We both have gone through ever solution to fix this that i could possibly think of and it is a problem for a lot of others too. Honestly for $60? What a fucking rip off. Not worth that money at all and the DLC's are garbage. Don't buy this game unless you want to waste you money.
:( OMG :( !!! Why i bought this game and why i bought it for 40€ !! :O Some friends were pushy and told me that this game is like the movie JURASSIC PARK. Hell no. I thought it gonna be like DINO CRISIS 1 & 2 but no. First, you have to play it in multiplayer mode otherwise this game is useless. Secondly, you have two mode in multiplayer mode : 1) farming stuff to improve facilities and catch dinos with people. Or 2) Doing the same crafting job and fighting against people (but this game is not a FPS). So if you like CRAFTING and FARMING this game is for you but if you need to release pressure and need a fast gameplay DON'T BUY THIS GAME !!!! PLEASE !!! x)   Enjoy life !! :)
This game CAN be fun no doubt. But the devs have no business relaseing more games when this one is still a broken buggy mess. Crashing is frequent, voice chat barley works and me and my animal keep falling through the fucking map. No to mention i have to exit then renter using alt tab to invite people most of the time. Playing it seems like a good idea until i actually do get into a game.
It's broken. There's always a descriptor file problem that just started popping up for the "shooter.uproject" before anyone says anything I have already tried verifying the game files and it doesn't work I also uninstalled and reinstalled and again doesn't fix the problem, not only that but nothing online helps AT ALL. I also looked for the file and it's not there even after reinstalling. As for the devs please fix this I wanna be able to play it with my friends but can't because of this game breaking bug.  PERSONAL UPDATE: I got it to work but I had to get the missing file from a friend so if you have any problems that's what you gotta do until they fix it.
This game is fun, until it decides its going to crash, and it will, repeatedly crash.
"Storage: 60 GB available space" *Uses 121 GB of space*
this is also poopoo swirl do not recommend
Better have a good PC to play this game. I owned this on ps4 and traded it back in to gamestop because of all the hours that get destroyed when megatribes roll through your game and destroy literal weeks of your life. It was a terrible experience on ps4 and I was dumb to think it wouldn't immediately be a problem on PC. Don't even bother trying to start this unless you have a dang good PC. Also, probably just don't try starting this period. I don't know what I was thinking. This game is always a headache. Seriously, aside from my PC being terrible I have played this game for countless hours on PS4 to be wiped over and over again. The megatribes rule. Stay away. This game is mad broken.
Game runs like absolute garbage. Its problems completely distract you from anything that might be enjoyable about the game if there are any.
WTF
This game has been out for many years and they have yet to fix it, i love the game but then constant crashes and the constant bugs is just annoying and frustrating. It takes me about 30 mins just to load up a server and if your lucky it doesn't crash and freeze your whole computer.
Please don't buy this game! During my time playing this I have spent 3 1/2 hours in the menus trying to join a server that doesn't time you out within 10 second of joining, the game is just an unpolished turd. Your money would be better off buying Rust or anything else but this.  0/10 Congratulations Devs you suck!
Love playing the sliding puzzle.  HOWEVER, I am facing A BIG TROUBLE on sliding those 5x5 puzzles. It is executing the wrong puzzle.  Specially, when I tried to slide the puzzle from top or bottom of the blank space to the blank space, it moves other puzzle, left or right of the blank, in. Ex. (Only in 5x5 puzzles, "x" means the blank space) 1,2,3 4,x,6 7,8,9 --when I tried to move "2" or "8" into "x", "4" or "6" will be moved into the "x" in the most of time. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG as soon as possible!
Only really worth buying if you like the Store page artwork.   With a bit of effort could have been a much better game.
Bad art, functional but very clunky and ugly UI, very little content.
What I write for this review is the experiance I had with the game, everybody will experiance things differently. This is my honest review if you don't like it well tough. Also no game is safe from a review wether its early access or full release. Now onto the review.  HENTAI IDOL is a 2D game where put the picture back together by sliding seperate pieces into an open slot. You do this until every single part of the image comes together to make a whole image. But don't the name fool you, there is nothing greate about this game.  1. The hentai women are okay, nothing special about them. 2. There 15 women in total or 15 levels. Each changing the size of the pieaces of the image. A 3x3, 4x4 & 5x5. 3. There is no sound other then the levels starting up. No music, no sliding sound & not even a completion sound. 4. The timer serves really no purpose other for you to manually write down your time just for you to try to beat it later. 5. You can't see each image seperatly, only as a slide show type but you have to scroll the images.  The game lives up to the word hentai but I don't get the idol part. I don't know any of these women. There is no name to any of them. You more or less give them a name like fox lady or demon girl. It would have been cool to have famous hentai character idols in this. Thats not say developer 911 didn't put effort into the women. The women look good, nothing didn't look smuged, smeared or anything like. Also I applaude developer 911 & publisher AmagSwag Games for not censoring anything in the game. This is something I like seeing in these advertised "sexual content" & "nudity" games of the character actually not being blurred or censored.   So HENTAI IDOL gets a 4/10 for me making it under average. What makes it a 4 is that its kinda boring, nothing exciting happens. Yes I know that nothing is suppose happen but its 2018 & I think adding a few things like sound would be nice. Heck even moaning from the women when you complete the level would have been awesome but that would have bumped the score to a 5. The game is worth the $0.99 asking price but i'd get this if you are bored & want to stimulate your brain a bit.  Thats the Pony review for HENTAI IDOL
It's so hard to play. I translate it into English production team to have a good look. It's a welfare game. It's just a little fun, isn't it okay? Hard to play so much for more than half an hour, played twice and lost every time. Fucking angry, just do what you want. It's so difficult and foolish. When I reduce the difficulty, I withdraw the bad review and buy the game again, even if it's several times more expensive, I can accept it. Remember, what I said
Basically a cheap, poorly done version of "Mirror". Poorly written, poorly animated. Definitely not worth the money.
Broken game can't even get it to start
Like Mirror, but crap.
Too short and with false achievements:(((
Even for a cheap game and having an utter desire to play a 'match 3' game while maybe throwing in a cartoon boob...this is utter crap.  The battles take way too long, the game is beyond ugly and it is just so boring.  To be bored while using a program based upon a leasure activity, to enjoy playing a game just shows how big of a failure this game truly is...  ...returned.
I do like the artwork on this, and the basic idea.   It falls down on a few things though. Its tile matching but the design makes it drag on, and on, and on, plus its really not clear what you are supposed to be doing and the screen you are matching on is small. So you get a headache playing. Fair enough if that's the design strategy but why? Just speed up that part of the game. Then there's skill aquisition, which again seems unecessary. This isn't an RPG most people will play it once then forget about it. Then there's the scroll through screens which are just boring.   It looks like someone has put a lot of effort in, but the result is an overelaborate mess that has some decent ideas that have been stetched to become boring.   Its overpriced for what it is.
Attempt to create another "Mirror". Dear devs, why don't you try something different? Tiles looks ugly - they are spinning, shine and look similar to each other (e.g. health and magic boost). UI doesn't help at all - no tooltips, no hover state. And why can't I use only using mouse to go through a dialog (you actually have to hit space to advance)
I bought this game at 51% discount and... I want my 39 cents back. The translation is awful. And I mean AWFUL. It's not just some gramatical mistakes, I don't even understand what characters did say sometimes. In current state this game is unreadable. And not only that, resulution is constantly glitching, and I cant't even change settings sometimes because game freezes. If you are reading this just... don't buy it. Don't waste your money.
I only bought this because Xiaoyun looks a lot like Haru from Tokyo 7th Sisters. [spoiler]I think"xuner children" is cuter[/spoiler]  I don't recommend this game. Here are a few reasons: [list] [*]It is really poorly made. I even have trouble trying to change the settings (and why the options isn't in the main menu?) [*]It has an annoying unskipable opening. And, the "Autumn leaves" transitions scenes. [*]The music is really annoying. [*]There aren't any CG scenes (I mean the "full screen artworks") [*]The story is about nothing. There aren't any branching paths and it ends kinda abruptly. [*]Obviously, the English translation is poor, but it makes things funnier. [/list]  Spoiler: [spoiler]For elementary school girls, they are well endowed[/spoiler]
You don’t need to buy this one. The ducks don’t seem to come it’s a waste of time. If they increased the amount of ducks it could be fun. But this is not fun.
Pony
It seems okay but I CANT FIND ANY DUCKS ANYWHERE, NOT EVEN ANY GOD DAMN FEATHERS OR NEED ZONES FOR THEM, ALSO WHERE THE HECK ARE THE FLOCKS, I NEVER SEE ANY!
It's broken, it says  "can't place any more of this structures" when you try to put decoy. I tried exit to windows + PC reboot + verifying game data, but doesn't work. Real shame for nice game. Why do you sell DLC that doesn't work???
the ducks expansion was great at release, then one day later they nerfed the snot out of it, the incoming patch is messing up the entire game, not just ducks, all lures caller decoy dont work -for all species, animal population decimated across the board. They really ficked this up. dont buy. will update if they quickly address how they have destroyed the game.
DLC is nice, but Ducks sometimes glitch in air above you, seems this won't be fixed anytime soon like the geese helicopter glitch so I won't give this a positive review until they fixed what shoul've been fixed a long time ago! Ducks are nerfed since 1.25, instead fixing crashes and leave the amount of ducks, they've done with the ducks the same thing as with geese! Lowering with time, quick death bonus of ducks floating to you is nice addition too!
Fishy AF website at GameGame.org with literally no content (this site is quoted in-game). The settings only let you change the window size, which you can do manually anyway, but the worst is: it's not picking up my camera at all.   At first I thought the cam had an issue, but going into FaceRig or even just OBS shows that my cam is fine, it's just the program not picking it up. You can't even set what your webcam IS in the program, so as of now it simply doesn't work.   No feedback from the author thus far either on any of the threads, so it's a clear PASS AND refund as is now.
The first game of videogame history turnsout out as low polygon graphics mediocre fun game but where the hard mode is the easiest to beat.
Having played the original Pong on an Atari console, I thought that playing Beach Pong would be a bit of retro fun. However, I found the paddles in this version of pong to be poorly-responsive (from memory, I believe that the paddles in the original black and white Pong were more responsive than in this game).  I thought I would do the achievements for Beach Pong, as winning was easy enough - but the game kept on stuffing up. Set up a 15 win game, win every one of the 15 rounds, and the game keeps on going. What the frick? Get to about 10 wins in a row, and the game starts going into pause mode after every win (this happened quite a bit). Again, what the frick?  Bought Beach Pong on sale for about 50 cents, but still feeling a bit ripped off. No way should anyone buy this for the full price; in fact, I would suggest that you don't buy it at all.  Unless you're an achievement hunter, you shouldn't waste your time with Beach Pong. Sorry, but this game is a bit of a fail.
didn't recommend it
Why did I spend money on this? No new cards were added to my collection.  Instead I just have the ability to craft the cards, and even then I could only craft 6 of them? For $13?  This game is such a rip off it's practically an advertisement for Hearthstone.  Deceptive advertising: buying this does not add cards to your collection. DO NOT BUY THIS.  Edit: Buying this does not complete your collection with new cards as previous expansions had done. It merely lets new cards appear in battle chests. So it's a good deal for people who've been playing a long time and have lots of battle chests, but it's a kick in the nuts to new players.  Don't buy this and don't try this game.
cool idea. still no widescreen support. i wasted my money.
It makes absolutely no sense that both halves of this set release at different times. Also most of the cards feel very underwhelming, and not something I'd pay $15 for
[h1]Overview[/h1]  [i]Boxing School[/i] is a management sim with between-round decisions being single turn-based and boxing matches conducted in real time.  The player trains up the boxer they have (and likely puts the boxer on the market after they're trained up to their potential) and tries to earn enough money to improve the gym and get more staff to work for the player (or even work with boxers) and hope to flip the difficulty curve all the while trying to train a boxer who will go on to win the world heavyweight championship.  [h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]  The graphics are all cartoonish and aesthetically pleasing to the player.  The boxing matches themselves are equally cartoonish due to such silly instances like boxers being punched and seen flying through the air.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1634374094  The sounds are all basic and nothing exciting, although the music is alright.  The only downer in the music, is that the player is expected to spend money upgrading the stereo in the gym for the sake of having more music loops to pick from when money can be spent on much more useful items.  [h1]Positives[/h1]  The between-bout decision making is engaging.  Normally the player is just going to find themselves with even top-of-the-line training equipment breaking down more than cheap plastic toys sold in thrift stores, but there is lots of stuff to purchase and abilities to unlock to keep the game interesting before the player's gym trains a world champion boxer.  The boxers in [i]Boxing School[/i] all have different boxing styles, which helps make each boxer more unique, though the game is lacking in incentive for players to train more than one type of boxer after they've trained their first world heavyweight champion.  [h1]Negatives[/h1]  The single biggest killjoy about [i]Boxing School[/i] is that there's no achievements.  After the player has a boxer become champion of the top league (out of three), the game becomes totally uninteresting.  At least if there were achievements, [i]Boxing School[/i] would at least have tangible replay value so the player will have incentive to train boxers of every different sort of fighting style.  [i]Boxing School[/i] also has just one single weight category for boxers, which goes hand-in-hand with zero achievements for lack of replay value.  [h1]Conclusions[/h1]  There's sports management games like [i]MMA Team Manager[/i] which are only interesting during competitions.  Then there's amazing sports management games like [i]Motorsport Manager[/i] and [i]Football Manager[/i] which are fascinating between competitions and exciting during competitions, but the most interesting aspect to [i]Boxing School[/i] simply isn't interesting enough to make up for the lack of excitement during boxing matches.  A word of wisdom to developers:  If you're going to put a message at the end of your games encouraging players to leave a review, make sure you do not abandon your product!  [h1]The honest word of Il Pallino... OR ELSE![/h1]
Look, I wish I could recommend this game but I can't. It has a lot of potential but it's unfinished, if the developers add new mechanics or more to the story then yeah it would be worth it. But in the state that it is in now, it just ain't worth it.
the developers stopped updating the game. avoid avoid avoid.
I've put in two hours in this game and all i have to say is its frustrating and down right stupid sometimes.The speed stat feels like i does nothing and the game is lacking content over all. 3/10
Terrible and inconsistent, bad tutorial, grindy but not rewarding.
Clicker game better suited for mobile phone.  Doesn't feel like the developers have invested much time into the game, there are a few bugs and a distinct lack of content.  I was happy enough playing this on a dual screen whilst watching Youtube on the other monitor, but eventually my top boxer (who had required hours of investment) stopped being able to move up the ranks in the circuits effectively breaking the game for me.  If you're down for wasting time with mindless clickers with the possibility of suddenly no longer being able to progress, go ahead, otherwise stay well clear and play almost any other management game.
Games is so so, it gets a little boring, Not much to do in between fights, and the fights are also interesting at first but it still feel like it needs something. The fights need to be more interactive, maybe have dialog options for sponsors and have rivalries, have events happen in gym, maybe have some minigames included or something.
This is a sim that runs well but for me it's way too slow in the beginning, While there is probably more upgrades and depth, I personally can't get  through the slow grind that makes up the early game.   Now this is personal to me as I prefer a sim that's more detailed or a grinder that's more interactive and otherwise the game runs better than 76 which makes it an actual game as opposed to... 76 .    1) I dislike being restricted in sim games without clear guidelines on what to get and how to get them. Things like Talent tree being hidden is annoying and irritating to me since I can't plan ahead with my strat.  2) There is a lot of waiting in this game early on, and without a clear virtual signboard saying things like, Hitting the body reduces these stats and so on I find the wait even more tedious as I reload the game to find the instruction that I accidentally missed.  3) I like intructions on what to do since there is a non zero chancce I accidientally myself into a slower progression by accident,
Good idea, but the game itself is super repetitive and becomes boring really fast. The fight system is also completely messed up.
*****GAME HAS NO TUTORIAL, IS NOT BEING UPDATED REGULARLY AND THE DEVELOPER DOESNT ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE FORUM, EVER*******  This a difficult review to write because I've invested so much time since I bought it a week or so ago (24 hours).  The game starts out well, and starts to become a bit of a grind mid game.  By late game, everything is exactly the same. You get to the highest level of boxing and you're still making the same amount you were at the beginning of the game.  And actually, it's been much, much less.  There is no reason to have more than one boxer for two reason.  First, it's expensive to fight them which ranks them up and gives them experience.  Second, you only get one "opportunity" at a time.  So having more than one boxer limits how quickly everyone can rise.  There are two types of fights.  Club fights which typically cost you money because you have to pay the boxer, and the highest level of prize money is fairly low (about 780 if you win), while youre typically paying the boxer about twice that.  The other is Opportunity which you can only pick once every five days or so and only at random times.  This gives you a share of the ticket price.    The problem with this is that the higher you go, the less it seems to become.  There is a Minor, Major, and a World Circuit.  With five boxers, it is a "school" after all, I was making more money at the lowest level than the highest.  I saw cuts at the Minor level of up to 50 percent of a $16 ticket.  But, the title fight was 10 percent of $3 tickets.  And it didn't get much better.  At the World Circuit level, I was seeing very low cuts of low ticket prices as well that were the same as the beginning of the game.    The cost to upkeep equipment is incredibly high.  You have to pay your boxers every week, and each fight.    The game, overall, is just very, very poorly balanced and doesn't have much of an imagination.
This is yet another management game with zero depth and no real point to it. It is extremely grindy, all you really do is set your boxers to train something or go home, then wait, then click next day and do it again. Every once in a while you fight, but there is almost zero interaction there as well.  The game does not get any deeper as you upgrade fighters and equipment, you will be doing the exact same thing you did on minute 1 after upgrading everything. Its like playing a clicker without any progression. Imagine playing Cookie Clicker and 8 hours in all your Cookies are made at the same rate as before.  Sure there are some skills and levels you can get, but they do not alter game play in any meaningful way. This game does not respect your time and isn't worth it.
This game is very... slow. You basicly have to take the strong boxer in the beginning all the others are shit. Even if you have -money it doesnt matter you can still repair your stuff.
I found this game in the recommended list after playing through Punch Club. It is more simplistic than Punch Club, but if you are a fan of these tycoon fight management games, this is still a solid game. There is a still a lot of grinding in terms of getting your fighters to a better level, but this also exists in the Punch Club game. I thought the mechanics were decent, and there is still an innate strategical element to the game. I enjoyed this part of it. However, my issue stems with the game constantly crashing. I have an updated PC with a newer graphics card that I installed myself recently, and have played many other more resource intensive games with no issues. I would win a fight, and the game would crash. I would restart, and I would lose some of the items I had purchased in my gym for no reason.   I gave the game many chances. I changed to the windowed version, I changed the screen resolution, I changed the graphics quality, and I restarted my PC again. All to no avail. I have to give this game a negative simply due to the fact that it appears to be unplayable. I see other users take issue with the innate gameplay mechanics, and I suppose this is subjective. I don't tend to judge that many games harshly, but not being able to play the game after paying for it infuriates me. It constanly crashes on my Windows 10 PC with no error mesasges that I could potentially resolve. I asked Steam for a refund, but their policy states that they don't refund after two hours of gamplay. I gave the game more than this time because I wanted to play it. I really did. I restarted many times in the hopes that these issues would be resolved. So, it is probable that I will not get a refund and will be stuck with an unplayable game. Thus, I have to give it a negative and I won't purchase any other games from this developer in the future.
24 hours played and I can say: I wasted my money. It isnt much good except maybe as a mobile phone game.
At the moment it's like a clicking stimulator. Game still needs alot of work
So after playing this little game for so many hours, I think I've long ago already seen everything that this game has to offer and the three best words to describe this would be repetitive, grindy and unfinished.  Defending at all in this game just seems to be completely pointless. There's no actual AI for the fights, boxers just randomly do things - even if they make zero sense to do - with your commands only really altering the chances of certain things happening. And this is why ordering them to defend is useless, your boxer is going to defend when the enemy is out of breath and can't attack or will defend the wrong spot or even if they do defend the correct spot, some punches are unblockable anyway. Even if by some miracle you do manage to block something, you haven't really achieved anything as blocking costs you stamina, which is also the case even if you don't actually block anything.  So since defending is just gonna go out the window right from the get go, what else is there left to do during the fights? Just telling your fighter to either go for the body or go for the head. That's it. You just tell your fighter to either hit the head or go for the body. Granted, the choice does matter, as the opponent you are facing as well their present condition, do influence which one you should pick. But still, it isn't exactly rocket science - it's very barebones.  Training your fighters as well as managing your gym's funds are no more deep than coaching during the fights is. There's just nothing going on here - just pick what you wanna train and that's all there is to it.  This game also has so many "features" that just don't seem to do anything at all. Many times for example a pop up appears telling me to pick something after which it tells me my fighter gained "+1 damage" or "+2 stamina" - yet that's not what happened at all my fighter gained nothing. So yes, this game is bugged too.  At least the art looks amusing so uh, that's nice I guess.  I just can't recommend this game even tho I really really reaaally wanted to like it. If you want to play a boxing manager, just go play Web Boxing League. That one is even free unlike this. It's not exactly a traditional manager game, but winning sure feels more rewarding there than it does here. Pick this game up only if you value neither money or time - or if you like VERY simplistic manager games.
Not for me, a repetetive and limited mobile clicker type game with very little depth and a lot of grind.  The wait for a great boxing manager game goes on I'm afraid.
Lazy, unfinished, unmitigated tripe. One of the worst games I have "played" in a couple years.  Pros: It doesn't crash  Cons:  Brutally bad UI Unfinished features Features with zero effect Senseless "mechanics" Boxing game where Defense is useless  Dev doesn't seem to have ever played a fighting game of any merit.   Dev has zero responses in ttheir forums.   AVOID even if it is on sale for a nickel!
[h1]History[/h1] The original Chuckie Egg was released in 1983 on the BBC and converted to many 8 bit systems, in fact 1983 was a very good year as 3 iconic games came out, those were Manic Miner, Lode Runner and Chuckie Egg and had cult status so it's nice to see a new version of Chuckie Egg.  [h1]Graphics[/h1] This version of Chuckie Egg as you would imagine has fully updated graphics, new colour scheme but first thing you notice is the size of the graphics which are just too big and can't be compared to the original and as they are large and the levels are no longer on a single screen which is counter productive but the screens do move quite nicely and the animations are fairly smooth and all characters from the original game have been recreated.  [h1]Sound[/h1] Pretty standard fare here, a new modern soundtrack which although sounds bouncy and has a casual feel about it really doesn't fit the game at all and to be honest it will get on your nerves if you play the game for more than 10 minutes so you'll end up muting it. Sound effects are very sparse and not many of them so in the original game you had quite a range such as walking or jumping but in this game it's almost quiet so atmosphere isn't great.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] Similar to the original but this is where the game falls flat on it face, speed is fine but jumps can be so annoying as they are very short, in the original you could actually have large jumps depending on how much you pulled the joystick but this version it's just set and you end up dying because of it. Getting stuck on ladders and sometimes you can't jump left or right but all gameplay from the original is there but jump is poorly implemented, sometimes there is no way out if a situation and you'll die anyway. AI for most part is fine but predictable but sometimes it behaves very oddly, controls are very floaty and weak which isn't good.  [h1]Features[/h1] Just basic featues and very limited options, does have high scrore etc but serves no real purpose as there are no steam leaderboards etc, presentation and intro is fine and does the job but don't expect anything extensive here but there are some other modes other than single player campaign which you might enjoy.  [h1]Summary[/h1] This is a game of two halves really, on the one hand it has parts of the original game which will be familiar to those that know of Chuckie Egg but you feel that you are missing something. The basics of Chuckie Egg is here but execution is poor, looks ok but the colours are dull and the sound is just flat and annoying so no real incentive to play more than a few minutes at a time. Sound pains me because i'm a musician and it just doesn't work in this game.  [h1]Rating[/h1] It pains me to see a modern version of a classic game just not working, wish the original levels were in the game in a retro mode but the dev doesn't intend to do that which is disappointing. I've played both the original BBC and C64 quite extensively over the years but they are light years ahead of this entry so is there any hope for the future? This game is locked in it's mobile roots so unlikely to change, this is my 1st negative review and not something i wanted to do but i have to be honest and say i consider this to be nothing more than imitation retro and very average.  I'll give it only 4.5 out of 10 ten as a game in it's own right but as a Chuckie Egg game it's a mediocre 2.0 out of 10 "sorry"
As a massive fan of the original Chuckie Egg from the eighties there is something about this modern take on the classic that doesn't quite 'do it' for me. There are certain game mechanics that don't feel true to the original. For instance; where's the bounce mechanic against the egde of platforms that you could rely on to get to others? Also, the soundtrack and sound effects don't seem to fit the game - they sound somewhat generic that suit it.  A major gripe though is that you can't see the whole level on screen at once - it relies on scrolling as you move around, allowing little planning ahead where you're going to go next as you cannot see where the 'ostriches' (ostriches? Really?!) are until you move closer to them.  I'm somewhat disappointed in buying this game. Oh, and nowhere in the original does it say that the main protaganist, Hen House Harry, is in fact a chick - I always assumed he was a Human.
This review contains spoilers for Nyakuza Metro. Continue at your own risk.  This DLC could have been perfect. The Metro was built well and was a great area to explore. I did enjoy the platforming this chapter provided. Online party was, well, they tried. I can see how some people like it.  It was the chapter's ending that ruined the experience to me. There was so much buildup with the Empress in the elevator at the end of Rush Hour and it could have been perfectly capped off with a boss fight. Seriously, watch a clip of the cutscene at the end of Rush Hour and you'll see how much of a letdown it is. Instead you just get cops getting onto the elevator and the Empress running away. The "secret mini-boss" was also a joke. One move for the whole fight. Nothing interesting.  In online party it isn't really online co-op, it's just A Hat in Time with some other Hat Kids that do nothing. When they say not everything is synced, they really mean nothing important is synced. It would have been great to have actual co-op over the internet, but what we got was frankly a disappointment. Having 50 players online at once was prioritized over having a fun and complete experience. Online party is good for a half hour of fun, but after that it gets pointless.  This DLC made me sad because I loved the base game so much. Seal the Deal, well certainly not perfect (I'm looking at you, three new acts called a chapter and insane difficulty in death wish) didn't make the major mistakes this DLC did. The letdown of the ending to the Metro and online party really not being what it could have been just ruined the experience for me. It's not a horrible DLC, but I'd only recommend buying it when it's at least 50% off. I'm sorry Gears for Breakfast, but unlike the base game I can't say I liked this DLC. 
The Nyakuza Metro is just okay... It seems like the base game is still the best thing you'll get. The Online Party on the other hand is really disappointing. There should be an option to join a public group of random people to play with. I can't even fully complete the achievements because i don't got 10 Friends that play A Hat In Time. I also don't like the political message, that the devs gave to us. Generally i kinda feel like A Hat in Time is going down the drain, which is sad, because the base game was my favorite game in a long time. I even dedicated my Steam profile page to A Hat in Time, showing that it is my favorite game. The only thing that still binds me to this game are the user created mods, which are really great. Elsie (LCL) for example is someone who has really outdone himself. The levels that he creates are as valuable as the levels from the base game. But there are also other creators that really show greatness and have achieved something very unique.
I want to offer some constructive criticism. Now this DLC is great when it comes to level design and music. It fails on some important parts though. Call me spoiled, but after playing the base game, this DLC is all… platforming. Now I know this is a platformer but throughout the entire game you had unique quests and events going on. In this DLC, the only thing that stood out to me was the final level, and that was after 8 platforming missions and 1 Time Rift. The online mode stuff is… Limited. If anything I found it an annoyance because when someone would join the game, it would stutter for a moment which messed up any platforming I was doing.  Another problem is the story and characters. For all the criticism Seal the Deal got for being hard, it still had some of the best characters, dialogue, and unique missions in the game. I’m aware there is only a small group working on A Hat in Time’s DLC, and there is only so much limited staff can do. But here is the solution to making a good DLC that isn’t to mundane so it offers a unique experience just as good as the base game, and doesn’t take a lot of time to make with limited staff.  Time Piece 1 : Unique mechanic level Time Piece 2 : Platforming Time Piece 3 : Re-purpose a unique mechanic from the base game that hasn’t been used much to save time, such as the hiding mechanic in the manor. Time Piece 4 : Platforming Time Piece 5 : Boss Fight Time Piece 6 : Time Rift  You may be able to squeeze more levels in there, but you need to space out every platforming level with something different in between to mix it up so it doesn’t get mundane. Platforming for 8 time pieces in a row gets dull in Metro, before you finally get that unique something at the end.  Side problems that can be improved further ;  - Better characters and support characters for the DLC levels, something unique and memorable. Like with Seal the Deal or Battle of the Birds. - Good level design, Metro had the perfect balance of difficulty and good level design.  - More unique and interesting enemies to fight. Metro offered nothing new in that sense, and had little to no combat. Why even have a combat system if you don’t use it, after all.
it just brings me to the regular hat in time not this dlc
As opposed to the rest of the game this DLC was annoying af. The tight spaces were a bad choice, the camera is all over the place and all up in hat kid's gigantic head, everything is dark and all the wrong things are shiny. Riding on the metros is also pretty annoying because of the momentum, having to dodge neon signs, and at the same time having limited amount to stand on. In addition the base game still only allows 3 badges on at the same time and one of them is the hook so really you only have 2 which is annoying, they are really not that OP that they need to be limited to a slot.  If you buy this DLC then it's for the online play which is a straight forward thing you don't need a review for that.
its too fucking easy and you didnt even include a boss fight, like how lame is this shit at least its only 6€ becasue its defenitly not worth any cent more
I bought a hat in time and the base game is really good, but I downloaded this with a Mac. Please add it to macs so I can play with my friends. Or please just say that it doesn't work on mac in a place other than the very bottom. I hope this happens soon so I didn't waste 10 dollars
I love A Hat in Time for the humor alone for a very big chunk of the game, and it felt me Nyakuza Metro loses it's humour very fast. No character is really fun or interesting to be as memorable as the main game. The only times I had a chuckle was at the food stalls, but other than that, not much else. Gameplay-wise, even though the Metro can be fun to explore, all of the Time Pieces to collect follow the same rules. All of them. They're all laying behind a gauntlet of platforming, wich I also like, don't get me wrong, but for 7 consecutive Time Pieces? Really? They felt less and less like an achievement and more like a chore to me, for not having much storyline or character and world interactions behind each one. The 3 final Time Pieces were the only ones that actually had creativity and variety in mind. As a whole, I felt like Nyakusa Metro failed vigorously in creativity. It's only worth it for the cosmetic changes, like the new hat flairs and dyes, the stickers, the smooth soundtrack and the 50-player multiplayer function. The ladder was slightly unnecessary, but it's probably the main reason to buy this DLC.
It just doesn't feel good.  > Level Design (i'm talking about the gameplay here) is very unisnpired and pretty trivial.  (Which is the DEATH of a platformer) > Ending feels rushed > Net-Code is pretty bad (Characters often very jittery)   Can't recommend for the current price tag tbh.
This DLC is basically unplayable thanks to the drastic frame-rate drops, various bugs and the introduction of Crashing-to-Desktop problems. The devs should have spent more than 5 seconds testing this DLC instead of rushing it out the door for a quick buck. 
Art direction and Game-play are up to standard for A Hat In Time base game, however the story and ending feels rushed and unfinished, leaving an hour long experience that is ultimately unsatisfying and really disappointing. It makes me wonder if something happened at Gears for Breakfast to have them work so hard on this wonderful game, and then just release this rushed and unfinished DLC level.
Maybe I should be relieved that this is a company I shouldn't follow any more. Seriously guys, you messed up 2 dlc's in a row? Snarkiness aside I was disappointed by this DLC. From what we got in the base game, with interesting missions, hilarious dialogue, mission based events, fun exploration, and interesting boss battles, to this, a scavenger hunt and a platform challenge. I don't care much about the party mode because when I did try it, it crashed my game twice. I'm sure they've fixed that by now but at this point I'm not interested. That being said, this DLC isn't as bad as the first one and it has it's moments where I'm sure you could enjoy yourself. But overall I wouldn't recommend unless you wanted an excuse to play this game again, but if that's the case, just play it without the DLC.
Honestly I'm a gigantic fan of the Hat in Time game, but putting a political statement in a game is enough to ruin it for me  That's all, other than that it's a great game
Online is a scam, and developers trying to promote faggets agenda. Stay away!
Seven dollars for barely 2 hours of gameplay (all chapters and time rift) Seven dollars for no new gameplay additions (like Death Wish) Seven dollars for political activism and message in a game where they don't belong It's better to skip out on this, honestly
It's just not that fun of an environment to explore. As I was walking through I just felt this urge of "Why should I care? Why should I try? Why do I care about this cat lady?" The food you buy gives you some funny dialogue which is funny the first few times, then you realize the shtick and wonder why even try to get all the rest. That dialogue is funny, sure, some witty political and social humor that fits in with what Hat in Time has already established, but why should I care? I have to go out of my way to enjoy it, and not go out of my way in a fun way, you just buy something a few times over. There are some strange political statements that didn't come across as jokes. Like, even the joke in the base game that felt super out of place about, "no moral cosumption in capitalism" made more sense in the context of Hat in Time than what they put in. Maybe I just missed something huge about the base game and assumed that the humor and wit was actually dead serious. I feel bad for supporting these devs, honestly. Even Seal the Deal was much more fun to explore. Maybe I just need to play more of Nyakuza to fully get the experience I was meant to. I pre-ordered because I really liked the designs and the world I saw, but I was given something far less than I anticipated. I feel cheated and I will remind myself with this DLC whenever I want to pre-order again. I don't care about online. Stickers are fine. You're gonna buy it to get the full Hat in Time experience, my review won't matter. The last thing this weak DLC needs is a controversy to get its sales up, so don't even bring it up online. I hate to say that I will be extremely wary of Gears for Breakfast's next project, which better not be another Hat in Time DLC. You don't need to prove you can "do it right this time". Your chance is over, just perfect the online mode, and we'll be good.
This and Seal the Deal have made me call into question what I even liked about the original game. I'd like to say it was the characters and creativity on display. The humor and wit. The fun, if pretty easy, gameplay that facilitated the joy of bouncing around these dreamlike locales. None of that is present in these DLCs. The characters are all flat and unenjoyable, you barely interact with them, and ultimately they bring nothing of substance to their respective chapters. This new one in particular is so sullen and boring. The idle dialogue you can occasionally run past is so lifeless and dreary, as you meander down identical corridors to jump on train cars and get duffed by neon signs over and over(The devs must have realized this, too, because there are health pickups literally everywhere so you're never allowed to actually fail).  The time pieces to collect are so bad that i'm almost legitimately offended. They're all out in the open just waiting for you to collect them. This is a 'free roam', but there's nothing to really explore since everything except mainstreet is a crazy linear affair. There's nothing to the challenges this time around, with one minor exception they're all ostensibly just 'run to the end and collect the time piece that is just sitting on a fucking table'. The yakuza theme is completely wasted. You're never chasing people down, extorting them, fighting at all. Don't tell me Hat Kid wouldn't do it - she intentionally crashes a the seal ship into an iceberg just to get at ONE time piece. Although she becomes a meek coward because of a single person in this one, so who knows what her character is at this point? What's even crazier is that your boss pays you in real money instead of pons - you know, the actual currency of her world that could be used to buy all these cool new cosmetics you're holding hostage?  It's frustrating, because at one point there was a fun game in here somewhere. You used to do things like explore a haunted mansion, solve murder mysteries, hookshot around huge sprawling mountain regions, settle a dispute between two bumbling movie makers, fight to get your soul back. There aren't any new hats to acquire(something so important it was a part of the game's title), most of the new music is entirely forgettable, what little story exists ends on an anticlimax, and it's over in like an hour and a half. What made the base game so cool? I'm not convinced GFB knows, because both DLCs have been designed with 'challenge' at the forefront which was never its strong suit. This chapter legitimately couldn't wait to be over with, and I guess ultimately i'm glad we were on the same page for that much.  This comes from a place of disappointment. I love how creative the modding community has been, and how great the core of this game was initially, warts and all. It just feels like they're making content I can't get behind, and unfortunately i'm probably going to be a bit more cautious as time presses onward. I hope people continue to enjoy the work they've clearly put in, but folk like me are going to have to accept being left behind.
While the overall level design is decent and interesting - not the best area in the game, but solid enough - the ending completely ruins it. The DLC spends the entire time with a character who is blatantly the final boss, who continues to annoy us, threaten us, and cause us misery. In the end, we finally confront them...and they leave. There's no boss fight, no change to put them in their place, no comeuppance for them. It's an extreme letdown and kills any interest the DLC has been building.  Also the part in the pink station where you have to dodge a ton of trains in a row is the worst thing ever.
If I could give an in between rating, I would. The level itself was great, very cool, but that ending was so inconclusive it ruined everything, made it feel like I did all that work for nothing not even a resolution.
I bought the main game about two weeks ago, I have played through it and had a pleasant and all around fun and enjoyable experience with this game. While i was playing I realise that there was this new DLC that had announced.  I ended up preordering it in with the expectation that it would follow in the footsteps of its original game.  To say it bluntly: this DLC is not what I expected.   Pros:  The Nyakuza Metro is probably the biggest place in the game and have several new objects like food stands and cat-drawn trains that the player can interact with. The Metro is also probably the most visual stunning and highly detailed place in the game as of yet.     There are a great deal of new cosmetic items that you can buy from many of the different cats you encounter.  The music in this DLC is somehow able to top that of the main game. The new songs all have an oriental and urban feel to them, something that fits the Tokyo inspired environment.  The Rumbi Factory is likely the best purple time rift time piece in the game, because of it introducing a new enemy and being generally unique compared to the previous time pieces.   Cons:  The time pieces in the DLC is way less memorable then any of the time pieces in the main game, I think this is because they are predominantly based around parkouring to different places to get them. Compare this to the main game where you usually have to do something meaningful and unique to get most of the time pieces. Although the platforming in this DLC is as a whole rather substantially good, the design gets repetitive when all of the time pieces are based around the same aspect of the gameplay.   Compared to the the previous chapters there is a surprising lack of story development from the start of the chapter to the final act. This combined with the the repetitive parkouring makes you question why you are actually getting the time pieces in the first place. And don’t even get me started on how anticlimactic the ending of this DLC is.  Although there are several new cosmetics in this DLC, in my experience you will not be able to buy a handful of these without grinding. There is not enough pons in the Nyakuza Metro for you to get majority of the items you can buy, even after getting all the time pieces. I had about five hundred pons when I started the DLC and after completing it I couldn't even buy half of the available items. Compared to the main game where I was able to buy all the badges and all of the podiums before I had gotten all of the time pieces. If you don’t have thousands of pons before playing this DLC you will most likely have to grind the main game for pons or just not buy majority of the item in this DLC.  Another problem I had the with game was the difficulty of the new chapter. There were just about no parts that I found especially difficult compared to the main game. I think this is because quite a few of the new timepieces felt like they was there to show off the metro and not to challenge the player. This also makes the DLC feel shorter than it should be.    Online party  I'm not going to touch it too much cause of my limited experience with it. I will just give a brief summary of what to expect. It is possible to see other players run around and use emotes to communicate with them, meaning you can also bump into them and are able to hit them. You can even complete timepieces together. The big drawback is that the game world are not synched. This mean that you can see other players moving through the air because they are on top of a moving object that are a different place in your session of the game. It is still highly impressive that you are able to play together in parties as large as 50 people.   Summary   In conclusion this DLC differs from the main game. It focus more on exploration and it feel like its more there to show off the world rather than to challenge the player by making them do fun and interesting objects in said world. This result in a DLC that mostly forgettable stages compared to the other chapters of the game. Would i recommend you to buy this you played through the main game DLC? Kinda, but not for the same reasons. The Nyakuza Metro is still a gorgeous place and with lots of things worth seeing, but it misses the charm and story that the chapters from the original game had.
Nyakuza Metro isn't that all exciting. The time pieces only have you going to different areas, having you running over trains and what-not. The final act is the only part of the DLC which seemed fun to me since it had you interacting with the character you paid to "work for".  Furthermore, there isn't even a boss fight during the final act, it ends abruptly. The only boss fight in this DLC is the secret mini-boss that references the Yakuza games, which is a nice touch, but there was no reward/extra interaction after beating it. Basically the entire time you're just running around, not having any unique interactions with anyone besides being told where to get the next time piece. Sure, there are some conversations to eavesdrop on, but that's really it. You should only buy this DLC if you enjoy A Hat In Time for its platforming and area design, because there is not much character interaction.
tbh if gears for breakfast werent the biggest homies in the gaming industry and if i hadnt gotten seal the deal for free id be pretty disappointed by this dlc. nyakuza metro itself is only an hour or two long with no real difficulty (even by AHIT's already pretty low standard of difficulty) to be found and no boss fight at the end and online play adds very little in terms of gameplay variety as it isnt a true co-op mode but acts as more of a real time leaderboard where everyone is in the same instance but just about everything in that instance is client side. This can even lead to some bugs like how in one server i was in the button broke that you need to press to get the key behind a gate in down with the mafia. If you NEED more hat kid i guess this wont help you because you probably pre-ordered it but you probably enoyed it but if you're looking for a bang for your buck high dollar to hour ratio experience you wont find it here, but if youre looking for a short but very refined platforming free roam map or just want to deck out hat kid in the objectively cutest cosmetics in the game go for it. online is garbage though dont even bother at best its a gimmick thats novelty wears off in like 30 minutes. also im not sure if i should make this positive or negative but i feel like genuine criticisms arent really being levied on this dlc like they should so im just gonna make it negative even though i did enjoy what was there.
If you think Online party is a co-op mode it's not. You can't progress your story with your friends. It's just you and your friends playing their games seperatly and can see each other. That's it. Nyazuko Metro's atmosphere was great but that's the only good thing about the DLC, there is no challange just find 8 time pieces around the world and get back which takes about 2 hours also the ending was a huge dissapointment because there was not one. Not even gonna mention the unnecessay political message they put in a paid DLC. I can't reccomend buying this unless you want some more AHIT experience.
The new level is more fleshed-out than the Not-Titanic from last time, but that's not a high bar at all. There's no final boss though so enjoy your abrupt ending. Did they run out of money before programming it? Optimization is much poorer than the rest of the game too, I had to dial back the screen resolution to run it.   Co-op is superficial at best, spamming emotes and stickers gets tired after an hour and there's very limited interactivity other than seeing other players and maybe racing them to the finish in levels you've already done.   YOU'RE STILL LIMITED TO ONLY THREE ACTIVE BADGES AT A TIME, that is UNFORGIVABLE! There is no reason you shouldn't be able to pick and choose which to keep active at any time.
With a crippled online at launch this dlc offers a new map and new time pieces, Sadly the developers also decided to include their political message on a paid dlc.
Online multiplayer is like playing with the ghosts from mario kart.
The overall content and work done on the level leaving up to the big boss is one of the highlights of the dlc that I really enjoyed. As far as the level goes itself, its fantastic no flaws it was fun! Spoilers [spoiler]The boss is hyped so much, and after everything she does, acts, and her threatening self, she turns out to be pathetic, there is no actual boss and while trying to escape I thought that I would fight her towards the end of the level. Its a real road block to do this[/spoiler] And I feel in this sense the games DLC price tag doesn't match the reward or experience. Collecting all the time pieces is fun, but it would just of felt better with a [spoiler]boss[/spoiler] At the end of the DLC. It was way better them the last DLC but this still falls very short.
Navigating the metro is very restricted and slow. Whenever you hop onto a train it re-orients your view in the direction the train is going as soon as you land on it which makes hopping from train to train or from a train to a platform difficult and nauseating, and whenever you drop down from a high area to a lower one it deals damage to you and teleports you back to the high area instead of just letting you drop down to a low area and take fall damage.
The extra chapter is nice n all but the online party is such a huge disappointment. I was really looking forward to play the whole game with my friend but nothing is synced beside hitting each other with the umbrella. It doesnt feel like coop,it doesnt look fun to watch your friend hitting on an enemy or boss that you cant see. I'll wait till they fix the multiplayer or at least give us the option to make everything synced.
Nothing is synced between you and your friends and the game becomes really buggy when you are playing with your friends...So yea really dissapointing that the dlc came out like that ...But you know ..hopefully they will change it... cause right now it doesnt feel like i was playing " o n l i n e " with my friends at all..
What is there is good, however it's worse than the last DLC.  It's much shorter and the ending is so abrupt.
(Rantish)  Don't follow the early game hype and admittedly awesome trailer. This DLC was very disappointing, adding a lot of bloat.  The chapter looks cool, but after about half and hour the smoke and mirrors disappear to just show so SOOOO many flaws. Just too many to count. The "boss" was trash, with a very poor unsatisfying ending. Also why did they change the menu, it was perfectly fine, the new one looks ugly. I seriously can't recommend this DLC, as it's basically a downgrade.   The only things I really enjoyed were the food idea and the new music.  As of yet I haven't found the rumba factory level, and am hoping that'll be better.
The new area is so aesthetically pleasing it feels like something out of persona. Also i have a soft spot for cats so this dlc makes me very happy. However it's very buggy and has some rather unnecessary politcs. Kind of sad i have to give it a negative review because i really liked it.
If you want multiplayer then yes, but you shouldnt buy this dlc for the story
I like it, wish I could give it a mixed rating but honestly I feel let down so here's a thumbs down. Nyakuza Metro is a nice, big open world to explore with cats everywhere, catchy tunes, meme material and tons of new items, like the baseball, stickers and new outfits, but the DLC itself is short and easy. Takes about 2-3 hours to beat, maybe even less with the guide enabled. The ending is rather underwhelming as well.  The Online Party is a confusing mess, and apparently it's not true co op but rather you only get to see other players in your game. Nothing is synced. Get on a sale, not worth $7 (GOG version only comes with Nyakuza Metro, as the Online Party relies on Steamworks, bumping down the price to $5).
While I enjoyed all the additions such as co-op and a new chapter, I can't help but feel robbed by both of them. The outfits, dyes and badges were the highlight of the Nyakuza Metro, not the time pieces, which were stupidly easy to get as long as you followed the path, not challenging at all. The finale is a joke and just ends abruptly with no satisfying conclusion, and to top it off, no boss fight either. Online party mode, as of release, isn't actually co-op, but more of you being able to interact with other players, and that's it, no story progression. The rest, such as cutscenes, enemies, boss fights, etc, are NOT synced between all players, so it looks like they're beating up invisible enemies. This DLC is good ideas implemented horribly and while I doubt GFB will fix it, I can't recommend it at this time.
Don't waste your money on this DLC, it's just not worth it.   -Online Party is a gigantic glitch-infested mess, and barely adds any co-operation other than being able to whack the other    players with your umbrella.  -Nyakaza Metro's challenges are easy, short, and repetitive. The chapter's atmosphere is great, don't get me wrong, but the    gameplay itself is very lackluster. Easily completable within an hour and a half. Not to mention the Finale is very bad. I highly recommend not purchasing this DLC. A Hat in Time is a fantastic without it needing to be here.
Honestly I was too star struck by the initial experience of Nyakuxa metro that I gave it a recommendation, foer it's amazing music and art alone.  In reality it is a very short and shallow experience, and it's story just ends abruptly and it left me feeling like crap when it did.  Really needed some time trials, multiplayer races, more deathwish missions... litteraly anything to give it more playtime, but nope you get 10 easily obtained timepieces and that's it.
A transgender pride flag graffiti, really?
I played the dlc for about 1 hour. The online party is not what I have expected. You can play in the same places with your friends, but nothing is synced. we cant defeat enemies or collect time pieces together. in this time I was softlocked for three times because my friend was too fast or kicked me away in false moments. other players have everytime the same outfit and the same hat. you cant see if another switch his hat or uses another outfit.  please make it more like the normal coop.
This new DLC does not even have a boss fight... what a let down
boring, plot was bad, the ending was a literal copout, no bossfight, the main villain isn't even named, all the missions felt exactly the same
Overall I don't feel it's worth the $7. There's a lot of secondary content but not a lot of actual gameplay. I was able to get all the time pieces in about an hour and a half and don't really care about the stickers or relics or food combos. If you do, I'm sure you can find it more worthwhile to pay $7, but if you're wanting actual gameplay then you'll be left pretty disappointed
After playing it some more, I can't really recommend this for the current price of $7. For starters, locking online behind DLC is greedy, and the online is surface-level at best. Nothing significant is actually synced (not even the outfits you're wearing except for dyes), so unless you enjoy spamming emotes and smacking other players for however long, it's probably not worth it. The only redeemable thing is that you can play levels together, but again,  nothing significant is synced, so it's like playing a watered down MMO. Remember Mario 64 Online? It's like that.  The actual Nyakuza stuff itself is utterly forgettable. The level itself is okay,  a nice metro area, but the story falls flat. There's no actual ending or boss fight, and it's incredibly short (basically a few fetch quests). The story just ends, leaving g only disappointment. The new DLC introduced a lot of glitches, and there's significant lag for even high-end systems.   If this is really their last DLC, it's a sour note to end on. They got their money to run with so I suppose they don't need to actually put effort into the DLC anymore.
Loved the DLC to bits, its much better than the previous one and is worth every penny... When it works. After the update I started to get lag spikes when starting a new level regardless of graphical settings and it crashed a couple of times too. None of this stopped me from getting every time piece so it clearly wasn't a deal breaker for me but it wouldn't feel right recommending it in its current state. Give it a week.
The way Online Party works as of now is not to recommend if you were looking to play with your friends as the local co-op would allow you to. You are pretty much playing the game separately with the addition of being able to see each other.
It's fine by itself but half the time it doesn't work. I cannot see my friend's costumes or hats. My game freezes a lot, even offline. Random lag spikes at whatever point, even in not-so power hungry areas. It's broken, I can't recommend it.
Multi-player isn't really synced with anything, you can't even see each other's hats which is pretty dissapointing, along with the fact that enemies aren't even synced. Nobody asked for 50 player online play, gears for breakfeast. Nobody. But you did it anyways and you did it badly to be honest. Other than that let down the dlc itself is pretty good, so i'll still recommend it. *EDIT*         I played through the rest of the dlc. There is no boss, there is no great big finale it just ends out of nowhere, why? I cannot recommend this anymore. Gears for breakfeast I still love you guys to death, but you can do so much better than this monstrosity of a dlc.
Heh, finished this DLC in two hours, the "Online" feature is just that you see other random players do the levels sometimes. I agree that there's a ton of skins but since it's singleplayer gameplay it's not very important, also you just buy the skins with ponds and earn nothing but the time pieces with the missions, which is kinda sad. At least the Seal the Deal DLC added really hard challenges but Nyakuza only added 2-3 hours of gameplay, that's not bad, but not enough in my opinion. I mean, don't get me wrong, those two hours were awesome, but that's pretty short.
The Nyakuza Metro dlc broke the game for linux users. If you're interested in playing this game on linux, please avoid.
Pretty much everything about this DLC is great except for the ending, which very disappointing. There's no conclusion or anything, it just ends and even though it feels like there should be a followup level to conclude the story fully, there isn't one. The whole story just ends up feeling pointless and a waste of time.
I love A Hat in Time, it's a very fun platformer. The problem with this DLC however is that it's $7 USD and I beat it in two and a half hours at a pace I wouldn't say was rushing. There were some moments I got lost or turned around and I was stopping in every room to look around for the stickers they added (I found 30 by the time I beat it).  The two and a half hours includes all 10 time pieces (8 found in free roam, the finale, and the time rift).  "Well, was it a good two and half hours?" I hear you ask. Yes, I enjoyed it up until the end for the most part. It was definitely on the easier side but that's not a problem since I haven't beaten all the Deathwish stuff yet.   This is a MINOR SPOILER if you haven't completed the DLC so be warned: [spoiler] There is no traditional final boss like I was hoping for. The bosses in the base game are really well done but sadly this DLC doesn't have one. You could argue the first DLC had the Deathwish bosses but this one had nothing like those. [/spoiler]  I'm yet to try the online portion of the DLC but I'm certain it won't make up for the length of the story portion.   Edit: I would recommend this DLC if you love the base game and $7 is no big deal for you. Otherwise, it may go on sale in the future.
Well the story kinda sucks, really gets the feeling of lazyness. I wouldnt recomend an average player to buy it, but if you like A Hat In Time you would most definetly like it. I did enjoy the dlc i dont regret buying it.
I encountered more game-breaking bugs in 30 minutes playing the new online mode than in almost 30 hours playing the base game. The online mode is also not really a co-op mode, I could see who I playing with, but enemies, items and even movable level geography weren't shared between us.
The online COOP is not what I expected. You can play in the same places with your friends, but no enemies, events, bosses, tickets etc are synced between us. The online mode also makes the game softlock frequently. We encountered three softlocks in around 30 minutes.  Cannot recommend in its current state.
I played the dlc for about 1 hour. The online party is not what I've expected. You can play in the same places with your friends, but nothing is synced. we cant defeat enemies or collect time pieces together. I was softlocked for three times  because my friend was too fast or kicked me away in wrong moments. other players always have the same outfit and the same hat. you cant see if another player switches his hat or uses another outfit.   please make it more like the normal Koop! And patch that bug with the outfits and hats! So that my friend for example can see my Nyakuza outfit!   I really love the Game!
Thanks to GFB for taking the feelings and confidence of your real fans, and wiping their feet on them! But now the transformers are happy! Waiting for the main character to become a lesbian, Groves and the Conductor will make gachimuchi films and mustache girl will turn out to be a boy who wants to be a girl. I'm waiting, GFB! Maybe this will return me to A Hat in Time. (Spoiler: will not return)
Very slow going. Also many game functions not working.
I played this game for a couple of hours and decided that it doesn't have much to offer. Also, I could find no way of saving my progress.
玩了6小时，其中5小时都在欣赏立绘和BGM，现在的光荣游戏可能仅剩这两项优点了。 另外的一小时体验了一下内政，发现可做的事寥寥无几，尝试了几回合后感觉万般无聊全部委任AI，于是打了一场仗，突然感觉就连本以为无趣之极的三国志13PK也变得可圈可点了。 创造以来的模式丢弃了打仗的热血，内政的玩点，一味的简化只会让这个系列越来越没有乐趣，因为无事可做。
The artwork is really good, but the gameplay is annoying. Completed the first puzzle eventually, stuck on the second, asked for a refund.   Have to wonder what the developers were thinking.
Not even enough materials to make a single potion. Probably an asset flip.  https://youtu.be/YUqBSqQdBX4
HEY HZDROGBA!! IM KOREAN YOUTOBER SRUMNORU! It was only a few moments, but it was fun ... Of course we could not play because there were only two of us ....
Finished the game in 2,5/3 hrs, pretty easy to be honest. Cool concept, cool graphics, cool music but damn make this harder: I've bought this on sale for 11 euros and I think it's not totally worth the price.  [EDIT] Even finished the achievements for a total of 4 hrs. Jeez..
I was very reluctant to click on the "thumbs down" option for this review. I wish there was a middle ground but considering that I've asked for a refund it would be very weird and inconsistent of me to choose the "recommended" option. But keep in mind [u]I don't think this game is bad[/u] - just has a few flaws that ruined it for me.  Let's start with the good: [list] [*] Great concept. I remember how excited I was when I heard about this game. I'm a fan of games that encourage skills that are translatable to the real world while at the same time not getting into the trap of being an "educational game", rather, embracing it as an unique experience with its own story and aesthetics. We really need more games of this kind. [*] The soundtrack is awesome. Probably the best thing about this game. [/list] Ok, now the bad.. [list] [*] The game is based on movement and typing at the same type. On paper that's cool and all, but the way you move in this game is by using the arrow keys (or WASD by holding the shift key... which is still awkward considering that when you're typing correctly you need to keep your hands on the home keys); this means that you constantly have to switch from typing to moving. In a game that helps you teach typing, it instead trains you with a specific kind of skillset that's not same as normal typing. It would be much better if everything were done by typing, to keep the player constantly in that typewriter hand position and state of mind. [*] The fact that you can't change hotkeys or configure your keyboard in a game that is literally centered around it and which the game's mechanics utilize practically the full extent of it is a game design cardinal sin in my opinion. It's akin to a AAA company making a highly GPU-heavy game and adding no graphic options. I understand the devs may plan to add this feature in the future but I need to review the game as it is currently. [*] Minor complaint, but I don't like the fact that while typing out chants you aren't actually supposed to type out the spaces. It encourages you to typelikethis which confuses your brain for no good reason IMO. There could have been a game option to require spaces or not. [/list] For those reading this review, don't let this discourage you from trying it out, download the demo and see for yourselves. It just wasn't for me.
This game has a lot of potential. The typing-tutor combined with bullet-hell is a great idea. It's nearly there, but has a few things that need fixed before this could be considered a real game.  However, most of the implementation lets it down. It misses keystrokes, the main menu is slow to navigate. It takes 1 to 2 minutes to get into the game due to all the slow cutscenes. The screen shake makes it difficult to see the words you're supposed to be typing. (Screen shake is never cool -- it just makes me seasick). The settings for display mode don't save. Some maps have things you have to do in a certain order even though it's not necessary to have this limitation.  Adding sidequests, weapons, skills would be helpful. Having enemies to fight which are not bosses would be nice. Rewarding exploration would be cool, too.   My hope is that the author continues to develop the game and works out some of the wrinkles so that this can truly be a great title.
This game is hard for the sake of being hard, and not in the "oh wow, this requires a bit of practice and you'll get it" hard.  It is hard because of tedium.  If you do not play perfectly the book loves to fly into the damage source, making you either restart typing, or take damage.    Also, whoever thinks that adding SCREEN SHAKE to EVERY FUCKING BUTTON PRESS is a GENIUS.  It was very fun feeling sick 99% of the time.  Started as a fun experience band then ramped the difficulty up by applying INSANE amounts of tedium, the same fight over and over and over, only to have to fight a new phase, get one shot, is not good design, and it does not respect the player, only punishes them.  Only reason this was on my radar was because of the OST and artwork, but the gameplay itself  is awful, not because of the mashup of two genres that was done pretty well, but because they waste your time.  Just because a boss fight is meant to be hard doesn't mean it has use cheap tricks to make it hard.  It is just boring and unfun at that point.
I played eight hours of this game, it is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. A good concept that was implemented poorly.  core problems: -no ability to restart -constant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs (book flies everywhere out of bounds) -missing a real settings menu -the range indicator (not the mechanic itself, but why the ♥♥♥♥ does it hide your progress thru the current word?) -story feels like it was tacked on 20 minutes before launch. Why even have this? It just slows the player down and ruins the pacing.  -writing (or what little there is) is garbage. The use of 'fusrodah' in this game is just embarrasing.  -extremely short -replayability limited to fighting for the leaderboards. -inherently unfun.    I wanted to enjoy this game, but ultimately it's a frustrating experience. If you want a typing game, just go grab typing of the dead. If you want a bullet hell, play Ikaruga. If you want to play this, just don't instead. it's in no way worth $15.
Thought of the day: If Ray Bibbia hates hypocrisy so much, why does his Touhou-esque typing game should have such an abundance of typos in dialogue?  It's hard to appreciate Textorcist. It's pricey for a game that's only two or so hours long, and yet isn't even well-polished. Game-breaking glitches or even outright crashes can occur during battle, which adds further frustration to an already bland experience.  Gameplay-wise, it falls short from start to finish. As a Bullet Hell game it's lacking because your hitbox is large and indistinct, and enemy attacks are mostly just 'bursts to be sidestepped' rather than patterns. The game tries to compromise by only subtracting from your hearts if you get hit twice- Once to drop your book, the second time for actual damage. But retrieving the book is frustrating in and of itself, as failing to grab it within a VERY brief timeframe will reset the whole phase.  Yet as a typing game it also suffers. Typing in Latin is surprisingly irksome, and the 'stylish' font is hard on the eyes and difficult to read in the middle of combat. Changing it in the Settings menu still doesn't help much. Furthermore, the clauses you type, even in English, are rather boring and half nonsense. Imagine a Christian prayer written by someone who only sliiiightly understands English grammar or sentence structure. Then contrast, if you would, to Typing Of The Dead, where the chosen phrases were whimsical, entertaining and a consistent part of the game's appeal in their own right.  The setting could be fascinating, except that it's not used very well. Almost every character has 'annoying' as their primary personality trait, including the main character. The game also tries to be snarky and self-referential wherever possible...which, due to consistently subpar writing, just makes it come off as unnecessarily edgy and slow. As noted above, there's also an irritating amount of typos and grammar errors.  A few more irritations: -Long cutscenes that you can't fully skip if you're replaying levels -Consistently clunky dialogue that does little to move the plot along or flesh out the characters -The main character is borderline unlikeable -Annoying minigame-style approach to selecting or unlocking the next locations  There's little to really be had from this game. Whatever potential the mechanics may have had is wasted by its lack of style and unpolished gameplay. Go play an actual bullet hell or typing game instead.
Mechancially, dodging bullets and typing words is a winning combination and there's a great foundation here for an excellent game.  Sadly, the game's very brief (about 2 hours), the gimmicks not quite striking enough and the writing and tone surprisingly lacking in any levity whatsoever, turning a ridiculous premise into a surprisingly violent and kinda edgy game? It's hard to express just how unlikeable I found the cast nor did I care about a single plot development.  it's not that much fun to type Latin at stuff, Latin is awkward and isn't inherently funny. When you get hit, you drop the book, only when you get hit without the book do you take damage, which is a fine enough compromise but your progress through a phrase resets if you don't reclaim the book in an entirely too brief window of time which can be frustrating since the book can bounce in ways that can make it nearly impossible to reclaim quickly enough or force you to take a hit. This is further compounded by the fact phrases get really long towards the end, it somehow makes bullet dodging Latin-typing tedious. The pixel font also interferes with gameplay greatly, since it's really hard to tell the difference between an "N" or an "M" or various kinds of uppercase/lowercase letters and numbers at a glance with is further compounded by the fact most of the phrases are in a dead language so unless you know Latin for some bizarre reason (have you considered learning a living language?) you can't rely on your fluency to smooth this over.  Mechanically, there's something great here. Stylistically and aesthetically, Textorcist is a miss. And that style turns out to be very important to this kind of game, so I'm hard pressed to recommend it given the brevity and lack of much in the way of replayability.
I wanted to like this game but it turned out exactly as I feared.  Instead of doing 1 genre right it does 2 poorly. The bullet hell and typing mechanics are at constant odds with one another. The bullet hell is pretty bland and simple and the typing is mostly nonsense words. The only difficulty comes from the lack of time during a fight to frantically move your hands to a typing position and get a word or 2 out. Learn to type 1 handed or use a controller with your feet for maximum potential.  If you think you'd enjoy having to type scrambled Latin while also having to swat away a constant barrage of bees with your hands this game is for you.
Cool idea, but it doesn't really play well. The font is hard to distinguish v's from u's and g's from c's. There's no easy retry fight button anywhere, and when you restart the game you have to watch all of the cut scenes over again. There's no settings menu, and when going to windowed mode the game just crashes.  2/5
Well – it’s different form the other games in the series. Graphics seems poorer as they didn’t want to make it look good. You can’t always find the tasks. It is much more difficult to complete the tasks. Somehow I found it idiotic to collect food that is soda and fries – in the other games it is fruit.  Naah – if you get it on sale it is ok, otherwise don’t bother… 
Editted: After trying to export an effect for the first time to day, i think this software does have potential to be good but right now it has many limited.  - resolution cap at 512x512 - there is no Autofit to Frame function (but you can zoom with Mouse scroll - this is not very convenient) - there is only few examples but no premade effects for you to use (this is not good, because in another software like TimelineFx or Particle Illusion, there are tons of premade effects and you will usually find that most of time you will use premade effects rather making new ones) - rendering (exporting) does not auto count the frames (come on!) and the length of animation  Overall, my opinion is this software need to be polished more than this for me to recommend it to anothers.
Is this an out of season April Fools joke?  No public servers Pepega
Fix the camera. The effect is bad every time you do a move. I get a headache after 30 seconds from all the rumble and bad reset to center.
Only rarely a game makes me so angry. This is one of those times.  I am a fan of fighting games since the original Mortal Kombat. This is... in no way a finished product. It's an open beta at the best.  Setting up your keys is a nightmare. There are many mistakes and misspelings in the key config window (like player1 select renamed player2 select?) or the fact that LEFT AND RIGHT KEYS ARE FOR SOME REASON SWITCHED. That's right. You have to set Left to Right and Right to Left to be able to move your fighter correctly.  Also, forget about all those pesky Select keys in the config. Nothing worked for me. After a few trial and error moments, I found a way to select my fighter. YOU USE THE MOUSE.  Can you tell the whole process of key setup left me frustrated, angry and already hating the game?  As for the gameplay itself - it's clunky, the enemy AI will often just spam a single move repeatedly with apparently no cooldowns, and sometimes I won despite expecting not to - enemy seemed to have a lot of the health bar, and I punched them once and that was it? A few times I experienced a bug where I started the round with 1% health bar and the enemy with full, of course I lost after one punch, man.  The entire game seems to be severely underoptimized. I had Good graphics setup (which is in the middle) and I steel experienced a clunkiness in FPS.  Summary: They key setup system is just bad and unfinished and doesn't behave in any predictable way. The gameplay itself is meh, but with serious, gamebreaking bugs with health bar. The design of the robots and graphics themselves are decent.  Do not buy, wait until it becomes more polished and stable.  
My first play and impressions of this game were streaming live and can be watched HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D66REJ0NPhU  At the time of this review (and livestream I recorded above), there are NO other current reviews for this game, and no feedback at all.. so I feel HONEST feedback is important for the developer(s)...  This game shows promise.  It could be a fun little game with some more work.  But it definitely needs a lot of work and love because as it is now, it only scored about a 4 out of 10 from me.  What's broken:    Collisions:  You character will fall down when just walking into any object what-so-ever.  It's quite funny the first few times, but quickly gets frustrating.  Maybe make it so you fall down only if running over an object, but not when walking.  And make the mice never make you fall down because that is just goofy as hell.  Fighting:  The fighting is complety broken and just not fun.  All you need to do us spam your left mouse button and hope for the best.  Make the fighting interesting.  Gave the player some way to dodge swings by enemies (besides holding up a shield) and make the player weapon collisions better with enemies.  It just needs work because as it is today it just looks and feels stupid silly.  Door Buttons:  Way to hard to find and see.  Make the buttons more obvious as they are sometimes just way to hard to find as they blend into the wall too much  Fix these issues and give the game a little more TLC and you might have a game I can give a recommended score to.  I'll check back on this one in a few months, especially if I come back and see some updates have been done to fix some of these issues I've described above.  At launch this game is funny, but it's a mess.  It needs work and I cannot recommend it in its current state.   4 out of 10.
[Linux Review] 0.2 Hours is all i played, The game is very boring, Leader board is broken on Linux (as in my score did not go up), game is to Dark in places and cannot see monsters, gun line up with mouse is hit or miss (Mostly Miss), Weapon swapping with keys 1 to 4?, in the year 2018 i would like to use my Mouse Wheel, 1 Map/Level (Very small), It did run at 60fps (v-sync on) which is good.  I was hoping it was more like the run and gun games from the 90's (Abuse/Metal Slug for example), with big levels and lots of Levels to play, but this is way off, more like a small survival game with random gun line up.  Sorry but i cannot recommend this game even at the £0,84 sale price, Better off playing Abuse for free.  UPDATE: Some things are fixed now, Mouse wheel to change weapons, Level is a little bigger now but still only one very dark level, A teleport pad that seem random to where your end up, New monster??, A bigger Red Zombie?? And a Red crab/spider thing so not really new monsters, Still random shooting line up, Online leader board seems fixed, Still cannot recommend this game.
Terrible controls, messy visuals, supremely unoptimized UI. There definitely are not 100 robots to choose from. Do not buy this.  https://youtu.be/Ez-rReLDbe4
Giraffe Town, without joking, is one of the worst games I've ever played. The jokes are unfunny, the moment to moment gameplay is attrocious, and the cutscenes drag the game on only so that it passes the 2 hour mark, and you can no longer obtain a refund. The horror aspect was the only semi-competent part of the whole experience, but even then, it is hit or miss and constantly verges on being awkward. The game is like a guy who sticks around after the party, making you and everyone left around him uncomfortable. Sure, he's creepy but in the end you want him to leave and never show his face ever again. This game has transformed me into a 2001 soccer mom, for now I hate ALL video games, because if my child were ever to come near this train wreck of a game, he would become a satanist school-shooter who votes not based on merit, but on whoever plays Fortnite best. Instead, I'd recommend Earthbound or Mother 3. Those games NAIL humor, story, characters and gameplay. Wrapping it up in a nice retro asthetic. Even the horror of Gygas in Earthbound is far superior to any pathetic attempt at horror in this god-forsaken piece of shit game.
Garbage do not buy
No where near as good as PotatoThriller. Falls short in nearly every category.
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. PLEASE SEND HALP.
The last section in the game is bugged as hell, most of my playtime is of that part, I would not recomend this game.
https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=xPxKo6Z5wTY  From what I played so far, I cannot say this is worth the high price point being asked. The bakstory is insanely long, and so far this is nothing more than a sliding simulator with a weird cult angle I have yet to fully explore. Giraffe Town is visually great and the facial expresions on our lead are hysterical.   If you can grab it on sale, it might be worth checking out if you enjoyed Potato Thriller. Sad;y, I cannot recomend this at the moment. Maybe when I put some more time in more story will come to light, but for what it costs Giraffe Town just isn;t worth it.
It looks cool and would be very handy, if it didn't fail to register the hotkeys half the time
Not a bad game over all except units get stuck off screen and sometimes in barriers and you cant shoot them meaning the entire level has to be redone. This needs to be fixed before I could recommend.
Balancing needs work. Found myself in a few missions where enemies were approaching from 3 directions and i had 3 soldier. One per wall, and then just sit and watch. Nothing to do, nothing to interact with.
meh
Very slow paced, boring, stagnant and not fun. Refunded.
for how cheap this game is still not worth it  i would rather watch the grass grow in the paddock
Difficulty ramps up to fast.  I play for fun not to be punished.
Pretty good day 1 release. Here's what needs to be improved before I can recommend this game.  Fix the aiming system. I shouldnt be missing at point blank range  Make it so I can pause the game with spacebar so I can issue commands to my troops.   Add some hotkeys for troops (like hitting 'R' with a grunt selected will send him to the nearest ammo box)  Add some music  Update the visuals of the defenses - particularly sandbags. They look like weird floating turds 
Hate to give this the thumbs down because I think it has potential and it is keenly priced. Problem is the game is a little boring and has gameplay issues- most notably aiming. The game does not seem to like angles and this can result in your troops missing at point blank range or because the enemy is a fraction to the side. On one of the missions I had a soldier at the corner of sandbags shooting at a dog on the other side and repeatedly missing. He dies from dog bites (or embarassment perhaps) and I had to restart. Which means going through the boring scripted bits of "select this and do that." I`ve only 3 missions under my belt but so far not a lot of stategy other than bunch my team together in a sand bag box and watch a rather slow and dull shoot out. Will stick it out and wont be looking a refund but hope perhaps game can grow from this.  Perhaps with a bit of tweaking this could be something special. Fix the aiming / angle issue, perhaps add a fast forward time button, introduce medals and the option to choose a load out from recognisable weapons for our intrepred defenders.
The chocolate didn't make me happy for its high level's difficulty.
"Night Magic" is a gamedesign catastrophe you should avoid at any cost. Even at Steam sales – if only you're not a collector that keeps games with really awful gameplay regarding them as a works of art (in their own way). Technically, "Night Magic" is a compilation of surprisingly difficult mini game puzzles, but the absence of savegame option together with the possibility of sudden death (just because you walked in a direction authors didn't wanted you to go) makes it totally unbearable.   Here's the thing: most of the games encourage players to explore the in-game world. For some reason "Night Magic" punishes the player for his interest in exploration, even without a warning. The game starts, you're going to the right, you see two or three doors, you continue to go to the right, you hear the sound of a falling object, and then the falling piano kills the protagonist (when you start to hear the sound, you already cannot avoid it). Same thing happens when you go to the left: some doors, the sound, the piano, game over.   OK, let's open the random door – here's the puzzle. After ten or fifteen minutes (I'm not joking, the puzzles from this game are not too original, but they're really hard and even exhausting), everything's done, and now... you can go to the left or to the right! Again! But what will happen if you'll go "too much to the left" or "too much to the right"? The falling piano erases all the progress you had. Start from the beginning, replay that goddamn mini game and don't be too curious next time! You completed two puzzles but still walked too far? The falling piano will teach you that this game is not about exploration – just solve all that difficult puzzles no one likes to deal with in other games and don't you dare to go away from the doors!   Yup, "Night Magic" is consists of filler mini game puzzles, and this fact alone makes the concept of this game awfully boring. That concept almost never works right – for example, see mediocre "Safecracker" by Kheops Studio – but this project is even worse than that. "Safecracker", at least, allows players to save and have no "Game over" screen; you can't lost all your progress in it in a second. "Night Magic" never cares about your progress, your time or your interest to continue the game (that’s why I stopped playing it pretty soon – as I already said, this is just unbearable).  But that's not all. This game has one of the worst English translations since Zero Wing (with its famous "All your base are belong to us" nonsense). Terrible PROMT-style translation from Russian to English makes it hard to understand the meaning of the in-game texts (for example: "A pack of cigarettes? Where did she come from? To smoke would..." or "I'm here the fourth day, and the way out and did not find... If anyone reads these lines, tell my wife I'm her very I loved").   Even if we'll forget about awful translation, the atmosphere is nonexistent even in Russian version: gloomy SilentHill'ish art-style, dark ambient music and wonderful, genuinely creepy sound design is mixed with cartoonish button sounds and absurdist falling pianos. The story is similarly ridiculous: [spoiler] our amnesiac heroine awakens in a creepy corridor full of doors, which she opens after every solved puzzle, only to find out that she is stuck in Hell, forever (that's the final plot-twist, as I understood from reading the text files in the game folder). Which horrible sin did she committed that brought her there? She smoked in a bed, fell asleep and burned to death. That's just great! While characters of Silent Hill 2 were tortured by their "inner demons", by the results of their poor choices made in a past, the main character of "Night Magic" went to Hell as a result of accident! [/spoiler] Why is this game called "Night Magic", after all? I don't know, maybe that's just a catchy name for a Steam product.   I don't know what can I add to this review. The music is good and the art-style is nice, but none of it can save the day (by the way, all the walls and doors looks the same at the every room I saw - it seems like there is no much variety in game's visual design). What could make this project better? Maybe savegame option, maybe "skip the puzzle" option, maybe option to choose puzzle difficulty, but still none of it would make a compilation of filler puzzle mini games feel like a truly good game: it was a flawed concept from the beginning. Applying all of this changes would only make this game playable, not "really good". On the other hand, in its current state "Night Magic" is just unacceptable: for now any change can make it only better, but it seems like the authors already forgot about this project, so don't expect an update anytime soon.
only paid 40p for this garbage and I still feel riped off this game has only one map, retard AI ,and no background music at all its fun for total of five minutes AVOID.
Very basic and lazy Unity assett flip. Just one map, shooting at a neverending wave of boring enemies for a score. There is nothing changing in the game. At first, i thought, it is ok for a few rounds, then i found a spot where the enemies can not kill you. Lame.  Gameplay-footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI2gQOUjaDM 
Awful, lazy, garbage. Pathing issues. Terrible textures. Guns. (Medieval guns?)  https://youtu.be/Bke-eVqnCkw
What a waste of money so many bugs in it. Just jump on a table stay there and hack n slash the monsters. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! you have been warned.......
The AI is not intuitive. The  card games are predictable and easy to beat on the hardest level.
I own over 200 games on Steam. This is the first game I have purchased that did not run properly "out of the box".  1st - When I first launched the game Steam was unable to run updates. No explanation. 2nd - In video poker I was able to start the game but at my highest res the screen looks horrible. Clearly it is not running properly. There is a table that indicates how much each poker hand is worth but I can barely make out the graphic of my chips and the card images do not show at all. Not sure where to go from here.  Kind of concerned - I noticed when the developer replied to a previous negative review he only addressed a couple of the problems the customer reported.  Not far enough into the game to condemn but not looking good so far.  Update: I was able to fix the graphics problem by setting all Detail settings to standard; however, while playing poker three times the screen started to shake and then blink before finally going all black. Nothing would bring it back, or even take me to my desktop - not alt-ctrl-del, not the escape key. Each time I had to hard shut down my computer and restart.   Also, no reply from the developer to my previous negative comments about the game. I suspect this is a significantly flawed program the people who are selling it have no idea how to fix it. Buyer beware. I, apparently, lose.
Despite maxing out the graphic setings, the graphics look choppy/bad. You cannot use your mouse, only the keyboard, which I found difficult and annoying. When in game I could not figure out how to actually select/play my cards. The mouse/keyboard only selected the side buttons and not my cards. This makes the game completely unplayable! Needs updated and fixed!
Meh. I was expecting live action cutscenes, but these are more like....rough handheld footage type scenes they filmed to storyboard the actual cutscenes.  Oh well.
waste of money lol
i cant use it how i use this super characters
Save your money!
Its micro transaction as a DLC.... grinding the game is far more fun....SAVE YOU MONEY!
I was drunk shopping.... save your money!
I literally just bought this because I was one hit away from victory, but I died because my controller ran out of juice. I had no gold orbs, and I was seething with rage because I couldn't kick King Cerberus' ass. So I purchased the cheapest red orb thing I could find, and sadly it costed me five dollars. Don't be a scrub like me, play the game naturally and gitgud.
ok i am gonna say dont get this ... but one thing i must mention is that you are only able to buy these ONCE! so in a way its not microtransaction so i have to give props for limiting the sale to once per person
I played through the whole thing in one 70 minute session. Now my right hand is sore. What can I say, well, it's fast, challenging and visually stunning. But the challenge is just to find the right way, remember it and input that button sequence correctly into your keyboard. There is much more remembering and try and error than reacting, which is bad in my opinion. I mean [url=https://www.twitch.tv/chainchompbraden/videos] some people like to input the same button sequence for years[/url], but I see that doing as wasted time. There are many levels which you cannot do on your first try, you have to try and error your way through. I find this to be annoying. Also the music is cool but only one track gets annoying during this time span. I'm glad it's over now.
Steam family sharing not supported :-(
An inferior game to the X3 series in almost every respect.  It has a mobile phone quality equipment list for the few ships available, combat is almost non existent, trading is flawed to the point automating it achieves practically nothing without mods, there are very few missions in the game period and then despite this game having fully half the race count (and far fewer ship designs per) they have the nerve to charge money for adding one back in as dlc.   An Alpha quality game sold as finished.     
Too many bugs, performance issues, shortcomings. Fighting of any kind is not enjoyable, trading between stations is just broken and not worth it. Reviewers keep writing that this game is deep and you can do almost anything that you can think of - that is not true, you're gonna be limited to either working with buggy not finished features like fighting and trading or overpowered mining and inventory crafting. Truly hope the game is going to be better, but at the current state just not fun and broken. Would not recommend at this state. Sadly cannot refund anymore, back to x3 for me.  1. Broken combat system (turrets just doesn't work, cannot hit anything moving or stationary, AI vs AI combat is even worse, you can find two fighters fighting for 20 minutes with no end in sight. never even saw capital versus capital fight, mainly 3 AI xenon or khaak would spawn in and get destroyed and then repeat.) 2. Trading between stations is broken and when it's not it's slow and inneficient, mining was made supreeme and the only way to actually get something done in this game. 3. Multiple performance issues, with specs I7-8700K, 32GB, RAM, 1080TI. Various bugs, crashes and just reloads   Game is better than X-Rebirth 1000x, but still you can feel how x4 is made for newcomming players more than hardocre fans of X3 and that's absolutely fine, but dissapointing still. You will feel fun for few first hours, struggling to learn and understand but after you do learn and understand new mechanics hype is going to die down and you're gonna see shortcomings, holes of unfinished stuff or features. If you're looking for X3 experience you're not going to find it here at this point in time, maybe later.   It breaks my heart after so much waiting to write this review, but the harsh reality is, the reason i bought this preorder CE just to support my favorite developer, and feel dissapointed and let down. I wish with all my heart that egosoft will fix it and make the game it was advertised to be. Would love to get 7000+ hours of this one too ♥
Just as jerky as x-rebirth well on the stations in space fine, guess they will sort it eventually.
Art Books贊 OST MP3 diss $17.99----收藏用为什么不發无损版，MP3(164~224kbps)怎么样也开心不起来，聽起來总觉得少了点什麽(气埸，力量，質量之類的) 先给个dis，有无损后再評分
While I really enjoy this game, I give this a thumbs down because of a very important reason. THE TRAILER IS MISLEADING! I actually made video about it if you want to check out what I'm talking about: [url=https://youtu.be/uI73-8WBB40]Here is the video[/url].
This is a copy of my review for the main game, I am copying it here because a chunk of the bugs that make the game difficult to play increased heavily in frequency when this DLC was released. I genuinely hope to edit this into a positive review once the game has been de-bugged.   Man, I REALLY want to be able to recommend this game but the amount of glitches/bugs really detract from the experience. Before the Garden DLC it was a bit more playable. The trash bugs were much less common (still enough of an issue to be infuriating) but now with the DLC out its even more buggy and the DLC itself feels incredibly untested. It's a fun and relaxing game, but the Dev's really need to up their QA. When the bugs are brought up on the discord server the best response is "Ignore the glitched house and buy a different one" but that detracts from a 100% save file and seriously hurts your in game budget. I have big hopes for this game, but if you're on the fence I'd suggest waiting a while for them to get the bugs figured out.    Also, a weed whacker to mow an acre of lawn? Do you hate us?
The base game is super enjoyable, which is why I did not have a significant issue with dishing out the additional money for this DLC. That being said, this DLC is not worth the price.   The mechanics as well as the visual aspects of most of the garden tasks are very poor. Placing turf and surfaces look awful. It just looks like you are pasting a repeated image onto the ground. The lines are difficult to line up, it's not a smooth transition and it's frustrating to feel like you're ruining an otherwise nice yard.    I strongly feel this shouldn't have been released yet. It needed to be fleshed out more. It definitely is not worth the price that they're asking as it is currently. If they were to take more time and really create something visually as well as functionally well done that would be a different story.
This feels very rushed and unfinished. A lot of bugs, missions that can't be completed, missing textures. It's definitely not worth the price, maybe half of it if they actually fix it. It just feels like something that 1 person made in their spare time over the course of a week.
Love the base game, but this feels like a lazy DLC. I've tried to play it and enjoy it, but it doesn't even feel close to being done.  If you want to turn the game into something frustrating, then this DLC does that easily.  The price for what is a clearly unfinished DLC is kind of outrageous.
The tiles I try to place outside always come out crooked.  Just one of the multiple bugs or annoyances that make this DLC quite disappointing.
Honestly, don't bother buying this. At least at the moment. It's very buggy and unfinished.   I agree with other reviewers who say that this DLC isn't worth the price. You only get 3 more houses and the upgraded items aren't even finished and say "coming soon" - why was this even released yet?  It's so bad that I'm requesting a refund and this is the first time I've ever had to do this.
I am currently upset with this DLC, I have been enjoying my time playing it so far and then I start working on “Family House” Plot and everytime I leave the game or the plot all my progress done to the plot is gone, at first I thought I was just not waiting long enough for a save but the plot just will not save and it’s only happened since garden flipper was released.. please fix this!!
boguht the expansion and it won't install or give me the option to even install it...
Well I only had the base game of this a few days before garden flipper came out. It was wonderful, however I would highly recommend waiting to purchase this DLC. Not worth the price tag for this glitchy mess. An update gets released for bugs, then creating more bugs. This expansion feels very unfinished. I do look forward to seeing the complete result, i just hope it doesn't take too long to fix.
  First and foremost, I am not recommending this dlc because of some of the responses I've seen from the dev to other reviews. Looking at reviews, I see dev responses such as "other companies would charge more" or "some would release individual dlc at 5$ a house, so really this is a good package deal", which makes reviewers like myself and others seem like we are wasting our time writing feedback. In this instance, I am starting to feel like the consumer's opinion doesnt matter, and that I shouldnt bother writing a review at all. Just because people buy your product, or other companies do things similar or different than you, it does not entitle you to talk over what a pretty mixed group of your audience feels.     When it comes to adding on to a game, I think this extra content is a little expensive for what it is: buggy and unfinished. There should not be a "coming soon" block to something that is supposed to be fully released. (I am hoping/assuming the "coming soon" refers to a lawn mower upgrade. Really, who mowes with a weed wacker?? Usually in this game you start with a small tool and upgrade it, but there is no upgrade from the wacker right now, making big yards a pain.) Others have made a lot of the same remarks I would; That there are not enough new tasks/houses added to make this really fresh content (for the price), there is a lot that needs to be cleaned up, and overall the dlc feels unpolished, especially for how long its been in development for. I bought it despite reviews to see for myself, but I ultimately agree that for now, more work needs to be done before I can give this review a thumbs up.  In short, wait until this dlc is further updated, debugged, and fleshed out before paying full price.     I do honestly like this game and the dlc. Despite the price and the way I feel about it as I have spoken above, I really do enjoy this game. The dlc completes the whole flipping experience, and now all the game is really missing is the option of customising the exterior of the house, such as roofing, (moving around) doors and windows, and more siding options. However, I think the connection to the part of the community upset about the dlc is also important. With the base game being $20, with several houses, tools, jobs, upgrades, furniture, etc, I fully understand why $15 for the dlc is making people so upset. At the least, I hope they add more houses in free updates. For me personally, $15 isnt a big deal, but I am more concerned about the responses going on than the actual price.
This add-on seems to be riddled with bugs and other undesirable effects. When I save my game for the night, and reload the following morning, I've got previously mowed grass overgrowing not only where grass is supposed to be growing, but it is also covering my walkways, my ponds, etc. This shouldn't be happening. I shouldn't have to mow the yard over and over after reloading a saved game, and have grass growing where grass should no longer be.  Until they fix screw-ups such as this properly, I will no longer be purchasing from this software company.
Compared to the rest of the game, the gardening part all feels so tedious. Even when you have all the perks, moving lawns to finding all the weeds or planting a bush just feel so long and not at all enjoyable.   (And when almost every job wants you mow a full lawn, it gets old real quick.)   As well there's just little stuff that takes it down, like the 'story' of the emails just being a lot of shitty people that makes me not want to do the basic tasks- or the fact that an upgrade for your tool is 'Coming Soon' in a supposed finished DLC.   I liked the main game a lot, but I genuinely wish I could remove this DLC from my game profile and just play without it now.
Okay, the good news is, Garden Flipper is fun. The bad news is that at present its a buggy, glitchy addon that does not warrant either the pricetag or for that matter the time it took to be released.   [h1]More indepth[/h1] On the positive side, you finally can do something about the overgrown gardens. You can cut the grass, remove some plants and things and use (most of) the resultant space to design a garden using a host of items. There's new achievements tied to the whole outdoors as well and you get a few new purchasable houses and jobs along with that. So what's the problemo?   On the negative side, its rough. Mowing the lawn with that weedwacker takes forever, since it randomly decides not to register what's been cut and what not with its shifting area of effect. There are trees and garden elements that [u]cannot[/u] be removed. Glitches abound as well, such as walls getting smears of colour at random, glitching through walls when laying turf (which by the bye also moves position between being put down and starting to roll), the garden hose magically spraying dirt away inside the house from the outside... There's also... the mole. Blasted minigame that really, really aggravates me at present. You suddenly find molehills on your property and need to dig at random through them until a mole (which is of a size to have been in the Fallout setting) appears and is temporarily scared off. Digging by the way is an exacting chore with hit-detection being wack.  No new buyers, only one or two new indoor items and no freebuilding? I'm sorry, but this dlc needs some tlc, or its simply not worth the asking price.

Ci sono continui bug e crash del gioco per non parlare poi di certe cose che non hanno senso, inanzitutto un paio di domande:  io compro una casa e perchè se ci sono già degl'alberi piantati io non posso potarli?, perchè se appoggio un secchio di vernice (ma anche qualsiasi altra cosa) e poi lo sposto rimane un pezzo di terreno senza erba?, perchè se lavoro su una casa e poi esco dal gioco quando rientro l'erba è tutta cresciuta? non è mica un server che lo lascio acceso e l'erba cresce! un'alro grande problema è il fatto che il gioco ha dei crash ogni 5 minuti! per favore risolvete perchè ora come ora questo DLC è ingiocabile.                                 firmato un grande fan del vostro gioco  ENG: First the game was relaxing and innovative but now with this new DLC everything has gotten worse. There are continuous bugs and crashes of the game to say nothing of certain things that don't make sense, first of all a couple of questions: I buy a house and because if there are already trees planted I can't take them down?, because if I support a bucket of paint (but also anything else) and then move it remains a piece of land without grass?, why if I work on a house and then I leave the game when I return the grass is all grown? it's not a server that leaves it on and the grass grows!

Not worth the money, 3 new houses for the price of the original game. No one mows their entire yard with a weed eater.
I honestly can't recommend you buy this DLC as it is right now. It has a lot of good ideas, but their execution leaves much to be desired, and it is downright unfinished in several places. Some problems:  - Different customers have no preference for garden style  - The third tier weed wacker is not even in the game yet (it just says "coming soon")  - Several objects have missing text strings and use their placeholder text  - Mowing the lawn is the most tedious action in this entire game, by far, and because it's grass it basically all grows back the moment you leave a house and come back to it Save yourself the trouble and wait for the developers to fix this DLC before spending money on it.
first off i feel that this dlc is pretty overpriced to begin with. it feels like something that was meant to be in the base game, but then they figured they could make more money off it. the price is too high for a simple expansion to a simple game.   next, even if you still want it, i highly recommend waiting to buy it because it IS NOT COMPLETE. the final tier of the grass cutter is 'coming soon' and not actually in the game. i stupidly upgraded to it and now i can't mow grass at all, so the game is legit broken right now.  and finally, while it is nice to finally be able to do stuff with gardens, the mechanics feel rather awkward (why do we use a weed wacker to mow an entire yard instead of a proper lawn mower? and i feel like weed pulling and grass laying could be much more organic-feeling) and the missions feel unnatural. it's just... not as satisfying as fixing up the houses in the base game.  it's not awful, but i can't recommend it. not as fun as the base game, overpriced, and i'm a bit dissapointed they'd release it with such a glaring error as a missing tool.
Imagine my surprise when I buy it and find out there is NO Mower. Huge yards full of tall grass that you take down using... a string weed eater...  Grass also enters through the walls and is visible inside the houses.   Will update if they ever add a mower....
Unfortunately, I have to decline recommending this DLC under the present conditions, here's why:  While the main game was interesting at first, if lacking in difficulty and a bit monotonous for my taste afterwards, I chalked it up to the developers going for a more casual approach rather than a hardcore one, which is a decision I respect and I made peace with that (I recommended the base game on my review with these caveats), this game, while it adds quite a bit of content and mechanics, is rather underwhelming even by its previous standards.  The added mechanics are interesting and varied (Except for mowing; even cleaning/trash disposing at it lowest level doesn't hold a candle to the tediousness of mowing a whole garden, even with the upgraded mower. I'm okay with difficulty at first, but there should be an extra upgrade for the mower, which I suppose could be the "Coming soon" sign); and said mechanics are decently showcased and applied at the custom jobs, which are interesting at first and end up being a tad repetitive, but are serviceable.   Problem is, it feels disconnected with the main game. Adding a percentage bonus for a decent garden is a nice idea, as well as the different types of gardens you can go for, but customers are still the same, and do not seem to have any preference for gardens as far as I have seen. Either adding this information for the existing buyers or just adding new buyers separate from the main group, like in the Bunker scenarios.   All in all, this DLC has a lot of potential value which can be easily realized, but this amount of content under the current pricetag is going to be a no from me. I will be keeping an eye on whether this DLC gets updated and I am willing to update this review if the situation changes.
The game is very glitchy and it seems underdone 
Not worth the money. First of all it feels this should have been included in the original game, which already had so little content, and not be sold as DLC you have to pay for. I really want to like the game because I like the idea but, just like the original game, the whole thing feels more like an early access than a supposedly finished game. It is feels sloppy, buggy, the content is far too limited for the price, the controls are just annoying, there are a lot of translation errors (German Version) because of which you sometimes end up looking for certain items endlessly, sometimes it's just bad grammar that gets annoying. All of this takes the fun out of playing. Was really hoping for some improvements but like this it's just disappointing.
Fix the game you cant clean your windows in your house it not working!  Fix the game   they aren't fixing none of their game issues and not responding to the any game issues on face book and twitter they aren't caring about the game    fix the game or refund all the player money  it be nice to fix the bugs and glinchs in the game garden flipper instead of not caring about the game only caring about the money and put unlimted  jobs in coming in all the time  the game aswell
To price this DLC as closely to the base game is absolutely ridiculous. yes it has some cool features some cool things added but just adding a mass of items we can use in my opinion doesn't warrant this price tag. i mean the lack of added houses alone should be enough to drive the price down. like yay. over 500 items added that i can use on the same houses iv'e fixed a flipped several times. adds to the work load of jobs without the feeling of doing up a brand new property. (yes i know there are some additional houses but not enough!) $22 for 3 houses and 500 items!? and some repetitive jobs i don't think so..  feeling a bit ripped off. not to mention all the bugs. i mean its being labeled as almost a stand alone title in a series but is very unpolished and seems rushed
DLC isn't even finished yet... What was the point of releasing it now.
now i need 3 hour just to record video
Would not buy for first of all its $15 and second right after i got it crashed after crash.
There has been a lot wrong with this DLC, so I'm going to describe it in a list format 1. Some plants will plant, others will not plant but your money still goes down like you actually bought the plant 2. First Garden Flipper job is glitched and will not let me pull weeds and won't display tasks  3. Despite mowing grass if you stand far enough back in the yard the grass will render again in the distance but the closer you get to it it will look mowed again  4. When planting the Salix Integra tree I got stuck inside of the ivy/branches after putting soil around the trunk  For 15 dollars and things that should have been in the base game it was very disappointing, especially because I can't even play it.
EDIT: Garden flipper was so dissapointing I no longer  have any desire to play house flipper.  I personally think that playing with this DLC won't make the game any more fun then it would be without it. It's a nice idea and adds a lot to do but it's just way too tedious and time consuming to be fun.  Things I liked: -Finally no more bare unkept lawns! -If you try to water anything besides the grass then the water will be projected back into your direction. -Dog houses.  Things I didn't like: -The jobs indicates a plot of land to work on but it let's you place gravel outside of it. -Cutting the grass takes forever even with upgrades. -Lining up the carpet grass thing is a nightmare.  -Making paterns with the gravel takes a lot of time. (mistakes, erasing, etc) -The grass cutter noie is activated when I wash a window. -Quantity does not equal quality.
Before I get into why I don't recommend it, I want to say this dlc is a neat idea and I'm sure in a month or so it'll be a great addition to the base game.  However, as of right now I'd suggest waiting to buy it.  -There are many bugs, including placing plants and having them disappear immediately -Mowing the lawn is incredibly slow even with the upgrade -Putting down gravel feels exceptionally awkward, as does placing fences and rolling turf -At least one order is bugged and cannot be finished to 100% -There's a missing perk, which I understand is being added in a few days but I do wonder why the dlc wasn't just put off a week or so so it could come out with the perk -Translation errors -Colour swatch errors (seems to show the texture rather than a swatch)  A lot of these are minor but it does take away from the overall enjoyment, so I'd suggest waiting a month or so for a lot of the above to be ironed out and fixed.
This game needs severe updates and it is an incomplete game released. The original game itself was amazing but this portion of it needs work.   Issues: - When you start out with gardening frame work, you need help on where every tool is and how things work. What do you do? Go to your inbox and do a job. Great idea, but that is some BS.  --- Job requires you to add plants and gravel. You search for the gravel, the placement is not practical and easy to do *horrible design* ----- The plants that the job requires you to place are not able to be checked mark or the requirement is incomplete.   It is impossible to play this game when there is massive bugs and design flaws. Hope to see them fix this but as of May 17, 2019, not good.
While I absolutely adore the base game, and the DLC does add some good additions, that strimmer or weed whacker what ever you want to call it can get to far to fuck.  Even with the upgrades its pretty terrible. In what world when you have a massive garden do you not have a flymo (lawn mower)
The game is overall fun, I enjoy the new additions of a garden and customizing it, However it is INCREDIBLY buggy. After completing an assignment I was suddenly dumped into the uncleaned, unfurnished version of my house, saying I still needed to hit enter to complete the task. After logging out and back in, I was again at my house, walls were painted, however everything i had done, furnishings, the new garden i was working on; Gone. It was commanding me to place my laptop as if I hadn't done that yet. I only hope everything I did wasn't horribly lost, it was a big house...  As of writing this on 5/17/19 I would not recommend this DLC, it is in its current state, incredibly buggy and at least one task I could not complete. However that is not to say my opinion won't change in the future! For now I say give it some time for the game to be properly patched up. I only hope everything I had worked towards isn't lost forever, here's hoping.  Take my review with a grain of salt though, it's only day one of its release.
This shouldn't be in full release - it literally has an unfinished perk system with a gardening perk listed as "coming soon" even though you can waste a point upgrading to it. I was hoping this DLC would demonstrate a little more polish then the base game to show that effort is being put into consolidating the project. If it were just a case of a few bugs, that's fine, these things happen, but releasing clearly unfinished work as a full product is just not cool
The game is very buggy, and the DLC isn't even finished.  - mower has no sound - arm isn't even covered - has a "comming soon" section in upgrades - Can't remove trees/bushes  Frankly, a lot of this should have been free updates to the game, and the dlc should be half price.  EDIT: will amend review once developer has updated game.
I was expecting a DLC that was actually finished... You know gaming is going further down hill when even the DLC's are unfinished and have a "i'll release it now, fix it later" attitude like most devs these days...  The last tool is not even in the game, just says "comming soon"  coming was spelt incorrectly and somehow managed to make it through to the released version.. most of this DLC is missing to be honest.  My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
The gardening skill is unfinished. With the third perk in the equipment line being "Comming Soon"  Now, this is an early access title and some of that is to be expected and forgiven. I am not unreasonable. But if you don't have the time, energy, or pride in your game to at least spell "coming" correctly... I'm not hopeful.  Let's be real. House Flipper has always been a janky, obtuse, and unoptimized mess. But it has always had a certain charm to it that kept me anticipating this DLC.  I am worried that the lack of polish is not due to developers who have a great idea and not enough time to iron out the bugs, as much as it's laziness and a lack of caring. I hope I'm wrong.
I am so very dissapointed in this DLC.  I love the original and could not wait for this DLC but it should not have been released yet. Here's why IMO.  -Right at the start I had the strangest bug where half my sky was a dark yellow and the other half was bright blue with white clouds. When I looked up at the sky it reverted to normal but as soon as I looked down half would go right back to dark yellow. While this was happening I also had this massive black box that covered half of my map straight down the middle. This also went away when I looked up at the top of it but went away as soon as I pointed my curser down. Forcing me to look at the floor or suffer the ugly sky and black box.   -You cannot remove trees so therefore you cannot have grass covering everything. So it forces you to have an incomplete look to your gardens. They should add grass seed that you can throw does like how you place the "gravel" and water it to get those hard to reach areas.   -Speaking of the gravel, I hate it. Because its round you cannot get the corners. So you have grass on the edges you cannot get no matter how hard you try.   -The shovels "hold to dig" funtion for me does not work as well. So I had to clik throw the dirt, click again, over and over. This made digging up the massive 4-5 dirt/rock piles extremely tortuous.  In general this was released FAR too soon which is upsetting since I felt like it took such a long time for it's release. I've asked for a refund because this DLC should have not have been released and it made my OCD flair up so bad I wanted to punch my screen in anger. If my refund is granted I wil purchase again if the game is properly fixed.
So far I really am enjoying this DLC, but I don't think it's worth the price the developers are asking in its current state.  I absolutely love House Flipper and was so excited for this DLC, and while I haven't been disappointed with it, I've not been especially happy either. I think as time goes on and more content is added, it'll be well worth the asking price but while I can't remove trees and there's bugs happening (I can't close the game, I have to force crash it to get out) I would say wait on buying it.  [b]That being said[/b] I do and will recommend this DLC when they've fixed it up a little and will update it as they also update the game.  I think just right now it's not polished enough for the price.
Game keeps crashing when I go to clean a window. Also when I mow the lawn the percentage stays at 0% and I can't progress.
This DLC was very disappointing, trees cant be removed, when buying many tiles it doesnt keep your rotation, alot of the tiles you have to choose from are ugly because placing many together they dont line up right (Grout lines, uneven tiles, half and half tiles) for the amount of time this took to come out i feel like they could have done a much better job
While I was looking forward to this DLC; I'm not loving it. Who uses a tiny strimmer to cut a ton of grass? Even with the upgrade it takes forever to do. There are quite a few bugs and weird glitches.   I think it might be best to wait until you purchase it; let the things be fixed first.
 House Flipper: Garden DLC falls short of what was implied in their own trailer. Expecting to use a shovel to make holes to place plants? It never made it into the DLC even though it's shown in the video they created months ago. The shovel has been reduced to being used on piles of debris. Also, some of the DLC features are only available on houses added with the DLC.  What you do get is the ability to fix up the outside of the houses. Some nice new yard furniture, and other added goodies.   What hurts this game actually happened months ago. They changed things like window washing and wall placement that actually made the game worse. This is the first title that I've owned that developers make the game less user-friendly. Many had hoped that since the DLC  took so long to finally be released had hoped that the developers were undoing some of the changes they made which caused many to lose interest.  Unless you are one that despite the game's downfalls, still play it a lot, save your money. If you stopped playing this months ago, chances are that the DLC will only provide a minimum of a revival at best.
House Flipper is a fun game. This DLC however, feels lazy. Sure, there are lots of plants to choose from, but on the other hand...  - Missing sound effects (either that, or the world's most silent brush cutter) - Some assignments are either basically repetitions, and/or EXTREMELY short. One assignment, for instance, consists of going in to pull some weeds and mow the lawn, and done. - At least one assignment is bugged and broken, effectively getting you stuck on 96% completion.  This DLC is sold at almost the same price as the base game, but there's not nearly as much content in this pack as in the original. Wait for a sale if you really want this.
[h1] As of: 16.05.19 [/h1] Currently the DLC itself  is Work in Progress. Apparently.  There's a lot missing. Ponds cannot be filled with water. Trees cannot be moved, or removed. Arm holding the weed whacker/trimmer is misplaced, naked (except for hair) and  is missing the other arm to hold the tool steady. Wall hanging lamps. Explanation on the different products (where to place, etc).  What peeves me personally the most. The trailer is NOT representative of the product. Same as with the base game. It's absolutely vacant of any population. Anywhere.  The events the devs pull are... well done, to be honest. But that stings even more when you compare that to what  could be used for the base experience.
Can't pull weeds out on the first house in the Gardens DLC. Assembling is also bugged in certain areas. I've had to restart the game a few times just to see if it might reset the bugs. Yikes. Fix your stuff guys, this would be a great relaxing time if it was actually playable.
Waited along time for this but its a disappointment. Btw who uses a strimmer to cut their entire lawn?
Too boring weeding and planting again and again... not worth the price. 一遍遍除草和种树太无聊了。不值。
I have to say no, i feel like this should of more been in the base game  & i'm feeling a little Content cheated. something that should of been their from the start.  Thanks for allowing us to buy the other half of the Game!!
After going trough the DLCs content, i feel like this DLC is unfinished. It even states so in the Perks listings where one of the perks are marked as "Comming soon"...  Most missions work as they should, but there are a lot of bugs and glitches. One bug with the last mission where grass is placed somewhere unavailable under a tree that you cannot move or sell makes the mission not 100%-able.  Digging is buggy where the digging is actually done before the last dig, and the fact that it swaps tools automaticly is annoying when you are doing tasks in bulk.  It also appears like the character is also holding the shovel in a very unnatural and impossible position when digging.  There should be an even bigger Turf-option. In one mission you can accidentally roll the turf into the house, and it is impossible to remove again.  I feel like the new missions are okay. But there are way to few new houses you can flip, and there are no new buyers in this DLC, which is wierd since that was an addition in the last DLC.  The DLC brags about having tons of new items in the shop, but its still difficult to search for specific things, and it is just simply a struggle to find the correct things for the missions. Adding more items to a non-effective items-ui doesnt make it better.  The new Garden-competition feature looks promising, but it feels like it just checks for certain criterias and gives stars from that. How about having a online competition where people can compete and vote on eachother?  In its current state i dont think i can whole-heartedly recommend this DLC as it feels rushed and lackluster.
i just bought garden flipper but wont let me play it
FIX IT!!! I CAN'T ACCESS IT
I beat this game in about 15 minutes, the fact that a game this short sells for $10 is a little insane.    The core gameplay is fun, it is a hand drawn run n gun, with one stage that plays like a side scrolling schmup in a plane.  There are 3 levels here, they are all fun to play and end in a boss fight but I cannot imagine someone paying this price for a game that can be beaten in 15-20 minutes.    If it goes on sale for a dollar or two then by all means pick it up, it is fun to play, but the price does not justidfy the content.
I'm not feeling too much buyer's remorse because I bought this using Steam wallet money I earned from selling trading cards and inventory items, but I still can't really get behind locking day-one-ready content behind a separate paywall. There's nothing all that special about the content in this pack. It's stuff that should just be in the game by default. Keep your dosh to yourself.
No, no, no no no dont push the Buy button!  Oh god how does this get through greenlight. 1h and i already beat the game. And for shure you dont want to play further. By feel there are just 3 Mission wich repeat over and over but with other briefings. No AI, or why is everything crashing into each other? Mission select screen is cut of so you see mission 4 button just half. Please Steam, help them young and unexperienced gamers and delete this!  (and this had to come:) But, its faaaaar better than Dubstep Absralsa. Oh. Eh, dont, no dont, dont search for that game. (If you have no money and just want to have 1 or 2 games to flush your time on earth down the toilet, yes, buy this and get as good as you can. You can make it!)
I like trash games very much and i had a blast with this game. So, i recommend this game to all trash fans. But for the others, i say just no, this is a really bad game. In Criminal Pursuit Force you are a female cop (only visible in the missions screens as a picture) hunting bad guys. The goal of every level is to catch an enemy car with your police vehicle. I like that kind of game and that is why i bought it. But there are so many things that are just awful. The graphics are outdated and there is just one small map (for all missions). There are not many sound effects in the game, just a police-radio, which tells you the same thing over and over, and a police siren. No engine sounds or other effects (maybe that is just a bug). The music is ok, but there are not many tracks. The worst part of the game are the ai-drivers, the normal ones and the enemy. I never saw such stupid drivers in a game, they even can not stay on the road. You have to see that for yourself to believe it (watch may video under the text). And on top of that all, the game is not finishable because in one mission, the enemy car is not findable. So my final verdict for the game, buy it if you want to laugh about the most stupid drivers in gaming history, otherwise avoid it.

There's quite a lot to like in this tool. Its algorithms are very quick and efficient, it includes a very simple-to-use gradient builder, and it allows a lot of control over performance options such as resolution, zoom and refresh rates, and power consumption modifiers. There are a few more features that would be nice to see for a more complete experience, but perhaps this initial offering will be expanded in the future: [*] Choose the coordinates you wish to zoom in on [*] Ability to save images/video [*] More fractals than just the Mandelbrot set [*] Desktop application viewer [*] Option to display coordinate, max iteration, and other relevant information in corner of screen  The only reasons why I am not recommending this software, though, are because of its difficulty of use coupled with its frequency of failure. The menu is not very friendly, with a lot of obscure settings that you kind of just have to try it and see the effect before you'll understand exactly what/how it controls. This alone would not warrant a thumbs-down from me, it is only a minor annoyance. Or at least it would be, were it not for the more crippling issue in this tool, the fact that the majority of times you start a new zoom it just won't work. The software recommends waiting 15 minutes to be sure that it has failed and then you just have to try again, likely for that attempt to fail as well. I've even given it as long as an hour on VERY lightweight settings, just to be sure I was giving it a fair chance before resetting. Not only this, but even if you do manage to get a successful start on your zoom, the program will silently crash after 20 minutes or so and has to be restarted once you notice the zoom has frozen.  The algorithms at the core of this are very good and when it works the display is truly beautiful. There is an excellent tool hiding inside of this program, and I am very hopeful to change this review to a strong recommendation hopefully after some improvements and fixes get implemented.
this is about as intersting as lift music.
Doesn't give you an option to just give equipment to your teamates that goes in battle, they need to buy it from you! for that option its just bad design if you tell me, cause teamates are like part of yourself you can give items to yourself when you are in the shop you can buy, you can place, you can trash items, but you can't equip??? wtf is this  and that i need to trash items just to have a good score, doesn't seem right! I should have an option to sell all my trash (items of low quality) to some vendor!
Despite being a dimestore Unity-based FPS, [i]Kulzas Tomb[/i] is at least somewhat entertaining in short sessions. The game drops you into a procedurally generated dungeon-like space and tasks you with using elemental magic to defeating endless hordes of random, often unrelated enemy types no doubt purchased from a Unity asset store. The enemies each have randomly placed spawn points which can be destroyed (think Atari's [i]Gauntlet[/i]); however there are some enemies who spawn from invisible, undestroyable spawn points. It isn't clear if this is intentional, or if the game is glitching and not generating the spawn points properly.  Which leads me to my next point: the glitches. I could actually recommend this game as an occasional diversion if it wasn't for the glitches and buggy gameplay. When the game randomly generates its new levels, it unintentionally makes some of the outer walls clippable, so you can inadvertantly walk through them with ease, causing you to plummet into that unmistakable endless void of unprogrammed space that is so omnipresent in these dinky little games (and in AAA titles from Bethesda for that matter). I fell outside of the map about a dozen times without even trying, causing me to have to reset the game. It's the game's biggest flaw, which is a shame because if it wasn't for this grave oversight the game would be very playable.  My other point of contention is the difficulty level. This game is SO. EASY. It does get more difficult with each level, but the difficulty only increments by the tiniest of amounts, forcing to spend a few extra minutes trudging through the first boring part of the game.   As it stands, I cannot recommend this game unless the developers fix it. If that happens, it's really not a bad little game, and is worth a glance.
[h1]■□□□□□□□□□ 1 / 10[/h1]  While the description for Night Fallen freely throws around words like 'open world horror game with stealth and RPG mechanics', it's actually quite the challenge to find any of these elements in the game itself. Just because you can crouch doesn't mean it's a stealth game; finding numerous 'upgrades' that don't actually (seem to) affect the gameplay doesn't make it an RPG; throwing in roughly one jump scare doesn't make it a horror game, either. All that does is make this product seem like a cheap grasp for pennies.  There is literally zero backstory of any kind apart from what can be found under About This Game. There's no way of accessing the options after starting the game, in case you want to adjust mouse sensitivity or one of the few other settings. The Steam page claims there's a whopping total of 18 achievements, yet after completing the game not a single one was unlocked. There is no way to save your progression while playing and dying puts you right back at the start, but worry not: you can complete this game in 1 hour. Unless, of course, rolling the credits followed by 'thank you for playing' doesn't mean the game is finished. Ironically, while some people are listed in these credits as voice actors, not a single voice snippet was heard in the entire playthrough. Perhaps they can only be heard in that one skipped building, but maybe some mysteries are just better left unexplained.  Night Fallen is also very poorly optimized, with the frame rate frequently dipping below 20 FPS. The visibility also gets very poor when being (slightly) injured due to the blood splatter overlay. And while it's the least of this game's problems, there are also several typos in the already very few lines of text.  Even if Night Fallen was free, it's probably best to stay away from it just to avoid wasting precious time.
This game is BAD. It doesn't even have a way to exit game so you will need to use task manager to close it. The graphics are blurry and that might be by design.  You can level up things like health and stamina but it doesn't have an inventory or skills page to check your progress. You can't save game, when you die your only option is to start a new game.
Refunded.  The hands are completely wrong to hold the swords (Vive).  Play is not explained and the story is not apparent.  Gameplay is very very simple with little variety or interaction.  Essentially, you can just wave your swords around and hope you kill something.  No blocking and not much of anything else.  Nice visuals but needs a lot of work.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkbyo7kT4I
Bought this game on sale, wish I didn't.  The premise of the game is simple, and unappealing.  I thought combat MIGHT be fun, but it isnt.  No way to block swords that I could find, and the gameplay was super easy otherwise.  10 rounds?  I just refunded after .1hrs of gameplay.    Please tell me this is just a test game for a new company, because they have a lot to learn.  PS:  The fucking hands are backwards on the swords...
Usual novel of School life with alittle sinister twist. Overwhelming amount of texts. Much actors and voices. Great Melody at the Main Menu.  Buggy situation regards to saving. Recommend to constantly manual save for reloading. Take note to complete various end story, start from the very beginning, instead of reloadings.  Decent  but Getting extremely dull with such multiple endings genre  due to repeat playing of the same story just for achievements.  Obvious case of broken achievement.
Finally I can uninstall this game now it's all done and finished. Sooooo much content cut from the main game, its stupid. I'v decided I won't be purchasing any further entries in the series, Tomb Raider 2013 and Rise of The Tomb Raider were quite great with the latter being the best of the 3 In my opinion. I'v played enough Tomb Raider.  About this DLC, it's quite short (like all of them), exploration and level design isn't amazing and the tomb just leaves me wishing for more.
That Seasonpass is a waste of money and after the disappointing main game the next huge disappointment. Rise of the Tombraider had some problems with it's Storytelling, but was a great looking, surprising and fun to play game in the end. The sequel is miles away from the predecessor and so are the DLCS. The Babayga Chapter and the Croftmanor DLC were incredible and they convinced me to buy the seasonpass ahead. I trusted the developers, but sadly I feel cheated of my money. The Seasonpass is not even worth half of it's price. Sadly!
 This is the final DLC of the game yet the challenge tombs say “coming soon” underneath?? Anyways  I liked this DLC some what I thought that the location of the tomb was super cool and everyone being brought together. The outfit and gun are great and the tomb was quite challenging.  +New tomb +New side quest +New weapon +New outfit +Don’t have to get gold on the score/time attack  -$5 for 30 minutes of gameplay  Perhaps not the best way to end the game I’d say that the Tomb Raider trilogy definitely lacks in the sense of DLC’s as the past game for sure has shiet DLC’s and these were just a bunch of overpriced tombs so ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh not worth it imo. 
The final DLC for Shadow of the Tomb Raider encapsulates all the issues with the game:  It's cut content. DLC gunplay segments. Unwhelming "exploration". Clearly designed quickly and rushed out.  Honestly this series of DLC have all been small, short Tombs that were clearly cut. The game is "Tomb Raider"... But these tombs aren't worth it.  Wouldn't recommend.
I went through all 5 rides in less than 15 minutes. I believe I like ride 4 the best. The bugs were creepy! Needs improvements, though. It's missing the feel of being on a coaster. You move alone a path, sometimes with 90 degree turns and impossible dips and hills, which were unrealistic. A few times the dips were so steep my head clipped through the coaster seat. Also, if the point is to narrowly miss the blades and spears as you are going, it needs to be fixed since a lot of them hit me dead on with no effect. Also, where's the clack-clack sound when you are going up a hill? :) I guess I'm saying it needs to be a bit more immersive.  Now, I've played a lot of VR, so I'm a bit picky, it does have a few good scares and would probably be cool to show friends who are new to VR. I like the concept, it just needs to be more refined... can't recommend it ... yet.
Sorry, this game is just crap! The game itself is boring after a few minutes, unlocking new characters takes ages and YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE!!! I spent hours in the lobby and wasn't able to find another match since the release. Seriouosly - skip this crap and play Timberman Classic instead.
ANNOYING AF
Ran horribly even on single player. Get tiki man instead.
It's not a bad game, but it honestly doesn't add much to Timberman. The very few new game modes just feel the same, even though they are different to some extent. If you enjoyed the first Timberman, it's more than enough to satisfy your lumberjack needs.
As one of the top players in the world from the original Timberman I was beyond excited when I heard a remake was being released. Finally, some decent multiplayer and some new modes! What we started with was not good at all. When the game first came out, you could only use certain keybinds and there were many broken features. While these have changed, it still doesn't change the core issue with the game: multiplayer region locking.  Arguably the most important part of the game for me is the multiplayer and this is where the game falls COMPLETELY flat. From what I've gathered from the dev, to allow for cross-compatibility between the Nintendo Switch and PC, they use a service called Photon to run their servers. However, Photon requires the games to be region-locked. Even if you have a private lobby for a friend who lives in Europe and you live in the USA you will still not be able to play with them. This is a problem, the multiplayer community is already pretty small and having literally no ability to play with them makes this game worthless to me. I am still playing the original Timberman because of this, there is simply no reason for me to play Timberman VS with such a defunct multiplayer service. For those wondering, the original Timberman uses the Steam servers for multiplayer and works perfect.  There are two other quality of life issues that impacted my review of this game: the new stages and the wait time between games. In the first game there were 4 simple stages (which are still available here), but the new stages tend to have a lot of visual clutter and it makes it difficult to pay close attention to the place you're supposed to chop. I do not enjoy playing the new stages and I HATE having to just restart the game so that I can play on a stage where I can see. Lastly, there is a gap in between the end of the game and the start of the next game where you gain XP dependent on how well you did. This lag-time is very frustrating especially when you just want to play another round.  Overall, I really can't suggest this game in it's current state. I would just get the original Timberman as its cheaper and the multiplayer is significantly more alive.
Region locked
"Join millions of players playing Timberman VS" The game barely exceeds 10 players in the past couple of days, and i don't think i will be able to find any players online to play versus me soon. Anyway, besides more customization, a hero mode, and that soundtrack in hero mode that is somewhere between good and meh, this is basically just another release of the old Timberman game...  Why would you release another game that basically is almost the same with the original game? It's like dividing the player base, which is already so thin, into 2. I'll keep this game, but please add something more interesting into the game so it can feel different with the first one.  Edit : Not even worth with discount.
It's Timberman. The VS might as well be a V2. Not that it is that bad though. It plays just like the old one except the ui looks nicer and there are a couple more modes.  However, I have major gripes with this game as it is currently.  In the old game one could press a single button to go back to chopping after failing. In this one you have to wait for a crossed axe fade to black animation, press enter, wait for the exp bar to display its change, and then only can you start again. Also, after every single run(and mine are short because I suck so this happens often) the three total chopping milestone achievements update their values and display as a Steam notification. It is annoying and unecessary.  On the main character select screen for singleplayer, after I select my character and confirm with Q, the enter key does not work to start the game.
Why is Timberman even a thing, let alone with this Versus re-release?
so is anyone playing this? cant find a match...
Couldn't find a single person to play during the matchmaking Can't play against friends Serious input lag(You can't be as fast as you want to, game wont recognize the keys you press.)  Can't recommend this game in its current state, will edit this review once the game gets better.   Stick with the first game.
Coming from playing Timberman for over weeks on iOS and over 20 hours on PC. This is been a let down at launch. Multiplayer concept exsisted before. Just repolished again with new interface.   Cannot find any players in multiplayer even after waiting for 10+ minutes. Don't know if that's a bug or there aren't any players currently.  Cannot find the option to play with friends. Cannot modify key bindings for anything more comfortable for single player.   The best part of the older game was the ability to quickly "restart" the game for the next round. Currently it's a pain to reset the game. Take so much more screens and confirmation to restart an game. SO ANNOYING!  Level progression system for unlocking characters is a good move. Lot more achivements are great fun addition to Timberman VS!
I don't know why but they just removed some features At first, you can't play this with your friend online except waiting for random matching You can't invite your friends to your closed room and play togheter  Second, we could use some multiple keys to play in the previous version but we can't now You have to play with A and D key if you play with keyboard so the game play got slowered
YOU CANNOT PLAY WITH FRIENDS, WHAT IS THIS BLASPHEMY.
I think after trying the game, having played the table top version  Certain things need abit of streamlining to speed it up  -Allow people to skip the confirm button per action to speed it up when there's no payment or they leave no assistant behind. -Don't allow people to zoom in to the tiles to see what the tiles are if they can't move there. Just have a view button pop up. -Don't have me confirm again which assistant I want to recall when using the recall assistant function when I click on an assistant.  Very Very bad user interface.  
Making Istanbul game, translate to 5+ european countries but doesn't have Turkish translation.
A very poorly done DLC. Few enjoyable pictures and the release of this pack sets forth an uncomfortable precedent for the future. The developer has stated they plan on releasing a new DLC every 3 weeks, as well, and should it follow the same pattern, I'm sure I won't be the only one dissappointed. This feels rushed, as if only released for the increased income.
Coloring Pixels is a great idea, I really like it, however the Farming DLC struck me immediately as having problems with sloppiness. I'm only basing this on two things - but right now I'm bothered enough by them I'm leaving this as is for now....  The image "Berries" was never tested I'm sure. There's multiple duplicate colors. I've been the first to argue that colors can look different on different monitors, and some people can't see all colors, but when none of my several monitors shows a difference, I've got a problem with it. Even if they ARE technically different, they're making the picture needlessly complicated. If it was a small one, I'd just ignore it and move on... But it was the first one I started. I spent enough time to find that at least three of the 18 colors are indistiguishable from each other. 1 in 6 is a problem for me.  The second fact is that there is only one achievement for the entire pack. That'd be ok with me, except that the RPG DLC (Which was very good btw, very much recommend!) had one for each image. The dev's explained there isn't more because of Steam, but this doesn't seem to be an issue with most other games.   I'm probably not going to refund it as I have faith the devs - who seem very willing to talk to - and take advice from the community will fix it.
There is no place for any strategy in this game. 0. There is no tutorial so you will not know why you can not play cards (there is mana in this game) 1. You try level to check what kind of monster are there 2. You pick cards which counter them (for example fire ball against ice monsters) 3. You finish level two times two gather loot which YOU MUST have for next level 4. VERY LINEAT, no challange at all. 5. You finish 3 levels, get bored, uninstall, refund 
I really like the idea of this game but it's too hard. It takes forever to save up money because of weekly/monthly bills and then it can disappear instantly from a surprise bill. If the bills were less even slightly, it would be a lot easier to continue playing this game. I feel like I've gotten no where in the 8 hours I played.
This game is strangely addictive.  Not sure how many hours I put on it, likely in the 40-60 range.    It is difficult to find the right thing to buy, and sometimes a crap shoot at the auction.  But you eventually learn what usually sells for a good price.  Watch out for counterfeit merch, although it is near impossible, as far as I can tell, to know before you buy it.  On to the story of why I stopped playing, and cannot recommend this game.  It took going bankrupt several times to start figuring out which items were more reliably sellable at auction; Furniture, chess sets, cutlery, typewriters, sewing machines, etc...  Once I figured it out, it was pretty easy to maintain and slowly build my bankroll.  As you have bills that pop up sporadically.  Electricity ~$50, food ~$15, internet ~$20  things like that.  I got hit with medical bills of $300 at one point.  I was able to soak that and move one.  Then...  After several ingame days and many real life hours, I worked my bankroll up to ~$1750, things were going well, I had a decent routine down, and then...  I get hit with a house repairs bill for....  ~$1775.  Basically the game negating everything i had done over the pasl 4-5 real life days in this game.    I am done, if you want an endless clicker/frustration simulator, this may be the game for you.
Good idea bad implementation.
F EPIC GAMES
JHFF
The McLaren is a great looking car but they've put way too many customization restrictions on it. Don't purchase if you are interested in applying a skin, wheels, engine sound or even a paint texture.
Epic.
Can't customize it do not buy this
Wouldn't even let me download it. I love wasting money!
I didn't get it so I guess I dislike this until I get it.
Bullshit you cant customize, should be more clear, thanks for wasting my 2 bucks
Doesn't come with any decals, and you can't choose a custom decal Can't choose a custom paint finish Can't choose custom wheels, and you can't use the wheels on other cars Can't add a topper Only antenna you can add is the McLaren antenna that comes with it Can't even change the engine noise  Doesn't even feel like a video game. It's just anti-fun.
The McLaren is a nice car in practice, the worst part is that you cant add any decals to this car. this is a dlc that i bout and would have enjoyed if i could actually decorate it like its one of the main features in the game.
Bad DLC
Dislike the non-customizable McLaren™ car.   \WHERE IS MY SPOILER!?!?!?   it's so flat that you don't need this if you own a Cyclone,  or even an Endo  - both are better-  esepcially with Ferrari™ & Lamborghini™ references in their design  OH - and they're FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE:!
Almost uncustomizable piece of crap car. I'm not really happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.
Due to license agreements we can't customize ANYTHING other than the primary paint colors, there are no decals for it whatsoever. I don't think that it is a good idea to buy this
The carn't be customized other than pain, and it that's not mentioned on the DLC page on Steam. There are many other DLC worth buying far more than this.  I like McLaren cars, but as a DLC for Rocket League this is garbage....
not, work
Can't customize enything cool.
If they dont plan on adding decals and making it more customizable, atleast bloody hats could be, it's a waste of money. It surely looks cool but you can't make it any better.  So far without customization and decals this DLC succ a peenis, even tho the car looks briliant
Why can't I customise this one. AT ALL?!   I vote this down because I want to change the wheels, the paint. I'd like to put a decal on it.  This might not be the Rocket League crew's fault though. I'd imagine to use the name McLaren and put the car in they had to licence it and that might've had some restrictions.
it didnt appear on my garage
First of all I was aware that this car would be non-customizable just like the other licensed cars. But Psyonix did a really bad job here. They forgot to even add the stock spoiler from McLaren. They didn't even made tires customizable.   But the really worst about this car is that it sounds like a damn LAWN MOWER.   I want my money back.
ripoff do not buy
all you can customize is the paint and boost. no decals , no wheels wtf? + car sound isnt that good so its completely shit Psyonix should fix the bugs ingame first -_-
This is such a fucking rip off. Why put a car in the game you can't customize? Before purchase thoughts - No decals, I think I can deal with that. After purchase thoughts - What the fuck! I can't even change the tires? Such bullshit. And of course they don't advertise this. Assholes.
Very good lucking car, except for the underside of the car, also if messes up ur camera settings as the car is really small 
Beautiful Model.. However, Either McLaren are insecure or Rocket League, for some reason, dont want you to modify it. Cannot change anything but the colour. And the sound is awful. It's A short clip that just repeats. Not bad for a quid and change, but I wouldn't lose sleep not having it. I used for about 3 games then went back to my other car.
Honestly, pretty crappy DLC. Doesn't even look that good ingame, and you can only customise the boost.  Only get it if you're a big fan of McLaren or Rocket League (and want to support Psyionix)
Beautiful car. No customization. Really bad engine sound: it sounds like very short rev up-down cycles, making it irritating in matches. Check it on youtube or twitch before buying.  Overall, not worth switching to it. So, not recommended.
It's just what you see, you can customize the Rocket boost, Trail, and Goal Explosion. Can't use decals, rims, or change secondary paint. Also can't put Mclaren rims on any other car...
Another one of those restricted DLC-s where you can't change anything besides boost and paint color.
Great car, but really should have mentioned there is not much to customize.
I really want to like this DLC, I bought it on the day it came out and I was expecting nothing but great things. I am left disapointed one of my favorite cars in real life is the most underwhelming car in a game I enjoy. You cant put ANY decals on it, you cant change the wheels, you cant put any funny flags on, you can only change the trail, goal explosion, and the boost. To which that leaves with just a lackluster car that barely performs better than the breakout. For $2 sure, I guess I was expecting more but its hard to follow up with previous DLC being more catered towards customising your car and having this game come out and let you do next to nothing as far as making the car feel like yours. It is a hard pass from me.
Lack of costumization not especified by Psyonix
Nice looking car but very dissapointing with its extreme lack of customization and zero decals. :(
its a cool dlc but i bought it thinking i could customize the paint, wheels, and decals so i wont recommend this
Nice car, but lack of customization...
No customizations to be seen, definitely dissapointed since basically all I can change is the color. Not even wheels can be changed, who thought this was a good idea?
You buy the car and that's it. No decals, no wheels, no toppers etc, literally no extras whatsoever. Why? Because they are going to put them all in lootboxes and fleece all their customers for every drop of blood they can. I used to like Psyonix. I used to think they were "okay". That they were good guys. But, over time, they have just become the same greedy scum as everybody else.
No customization
Cant put anything on besides boost, original paint colors, one antenna, and goal explosion... Would have been nice to see that before I purchased. Lame.
*Can't customize anything but the color (not finish or skins)  The more you know...
I was hyped when I saw this release; An actual licensed supercar! And then they go and f*** it up! I bought it, launched the game, found the issues, wrote the review, and then refunded.   The positive: + It is a beautiful model  + Has same hitbox as dominus  The bad: - Can't customize paintjob. You will select your color, and that's it. No dual color, no color finish options (matt, metallic, pearl etc...) - No decals - Can't select other rims, except McLaren's own rims - McLaren's rims cannot be used on other cars - Can't select hats - Can't change engine sounds  It reeks of license agreement policies; McLaren wants to protect their licensed car, and I get it. But it also defeats the entire purpose of having such strict guide lines for a game about rocket propelled remote controlled cars.... Jesus McLaren, ease up a little bit. And I thus think Psyonix should have skipped purchasing this car all together from McLaren.  If you are okay with the limited cusomizing options, then by all means buy it, but I think it is too limiting and too narrow minded by McLaren. Psyonix: If you are going to start adding licensed cars into the game, please make sure that they will still be customizable!
is this a joke ??? I wont even say anything about how you cant customize the car but these hitboxes ???? that turn radius ??? I swear some of the cross jumps gave me cancer... I'm not saying make it op but I paid for it so dont make it suck this much...
Can't add custom skins or wheels?  Really?
You cant customize the car and the hitboxes sucks... money not worth
 Too strict with the customization options. Feels more  like a 'brand' focused cash grab than a fan of the game.
Be warned, you can't use any toppers, any antenna other than the mclaren flag, and there's no paint kits, just flat solid colour.
No customization...why?
Have not won a single match since purchasing this car. Do not buy.
Its a no for me. Only can customize 3 things and thats it, nothing else. Only thing that I liked was the engine sound. Max price 50 cents
iz shiz no bai
No customization, as everyone has said. No it doesn't affect the feel of the car, but for a game that has such a large emphasis on customization it's disappointing. Almost every DLC vehicle allows customization. Glad that they failed to mention you couldn't customize the car in  the details for this DLC.
Really bad, overpriced car. You have dominus hit box, on a questionable mesh, with no customisation what so ever.  one of the most lazy ass job they did in a while. Top price for this should be 50 cents at most. In 2 words,: useless and worthless
While it is gorgeous to look at, that is not what a McLaren sounds like. McLarens growl. this sounds like a bizzaro honda cosplaying as a McLaren.  This is what a McLaren sounds like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiNJtPMjK9M FIX THE SOUND! 
I DONT GETTING THE CAR 
Nice enough car, looks cool and drives smooth. But you can hardly customise it at all, guess I should of expected that with a McLaren agreement like this. You can change the boost and the goal celebration, no toppers, decals and only a specific flag.
I regret buying this. The skyline dlc made me think they were over this "no customization on licensed vehicles"  bs. Guess not You can only customize the following -color -boost -trail -goal explosion   You can't cutomize the following: -paint type -decal -wheels -topper/antenna -engine audio  Dominus hitbox
You want decals? Toppers? What about other flags or wheels? Well...you get NONE of that. Oh! and 1 single colour too! *^*
Again a DLC car where you can't change anything. Yes there are licenses but on this car you would think you can at least use your BM decals or other wheels. It comes with one type of wheels and no decal at all and the only thing you can change is the trail and the boost. You can't use any of the items on other cars.  Please, at least add warnings to your DLC cars then "you can't modify this car and it doesn't include any decals"!!!
literally the worst car pack ever....no changing wheels, paint, topper, decal, flag.....
Things you can't do: * Put any decals on it and also doesn't come with any... * Change paint finish... * Change tires... * Place a topper on it... * Use any antennas (except the one they give you) * Change the engine noise...  Things you can change: * Boost trail * Boost * Goal Explosion.   I get why you couldn't do those on the special cars (Batmobile, Jurassic Park Jeeps), but this is stupid.  I'm so disapointed in it that I actually requested a refund.
Looks more like a toy car then any other car in the game
good car, but you can't do anything, is boring, you can't change the wheels, nothing..
Can't use decals on it, and cant even put custom rims on it. I would be okay with not being able to change the decal, but not even custom rims/tires? This was not worth it and i want a refund.
Car has no customization options. On top of that, you cant use any of the items that come with the car on other cars. Looks and feels dry and its the same hitbox as a dominus (not a bad thing). If you want a dominus hitbox just use the dominus, at least it has options to customize it
I buy all Rocket League DLC, and their pretty cheap too. This one is pretty disappointing, you get a care that is barely customizeable. You cant put a decal on it, cant change the wheels, and no topper. And you also get 2 banners that look kind of cool. All in all, I think this DLC pack kind of sucks.
Nothing can go on this beautiful canvas.Only can change the paint color, not the type of paint, the boost and the goal explosion. Sad this gorgeous car is so limited.
Feels like a Dominus.  Decals can't be used, can't change types of paint, can't use other wheels asides of the advertised, toppers can't be used. Only the McLaren flag and sound engine can be used.  Car color, boosts, trails and goals able to be changed to any available on the game. McLaren wheels can't be used on other cars.   Wanted to leave a neutral recommendation, since it's not possible, I can't really recommend it.
I like what they are trying to do but the whole "All your base belongs to us" kind of purposeful translation gets old fast. In addition, you are dropped in without much explanation for what is going on or how the game works. The interface is clunky and there is a lot of nothing going on. In my first engagement I started very far away from the enemy and they seemed content to stay well away leading to a lot of time just trying to get in range. Very ponderous. First game I ever asked for a refund on. 
The only difference from the past 2K games is the roster and MyCareer. We STILL have the same copy-paste stuff year after year. This will be my last WWE game until they make major overhauls with creation like adding more in-depth titantron creation, more realistic commentary (they could just use show audio), re-adding the Export MyPLAYER option that they had once in WWE 2K17, be more interactive with fans about DLC releases instead of a couple weeks beforehand, etc.  WWE needs to get a developer on the series that CARES. I mean, EA Sports updated their Madden 25 roster, but we can't even get an attire update from 2K... Very disappointing, but I'll enjoy it while I can.  EDIT: Oh and I almost forgot to mention, we don't even get the NXT superstars that show up at NXT Live events like Kona Reeves or Brennan Willams. And that's just the two notable names I saw in person... I'd more than understand if they didn't agree, but it's ridiculous that 2K doesn't even have them, let alone Ciampa, and not tell us why. They're really terrible with marketing along with fan communication.
$39.95 For a couple of NXT characters and some others who have been on the main roster for years and are just locked behind a paywall.
where the fuck is my DLC for real you cant make a DLC of nothing its a lot of money and its fucking nothing thanks 2K
So my reaction is as good (or bad) as anyone elses.    WHERE TF ARE ALL MY DLC?S Don't buy this, it's a waste of money. There's basically no difference from the original game. I do recommend the original game, but not the SP
WHERE IS MY DLC?? i PAY 130$ FOR NOT HAVING ANY DLC
This is really unnecessary. It's not a big loss if you skip this DLC pack. You just get a bunch of character variations of wrestlers that are already in the game (in casual/street clothes, at that.) Probably worth it for the American Badass 'Taker and the Starrcade 83 ring, but not at this price point.
Gotta love it when devs remove content from the base game, add it as DLC, and then don't even include it in the season pass.
Is ridiculous that you have to pay to unlock every wrestler
soup
This is the worst game i have ever played, its crap dont wast the money.
This "artbook" isn't what I expected. . . in a bad way. It is a 24-page PDF which is downloaded to Attractorache's install directory. It features seven images of the girls, and sixteen images of space. The space pictures look great, but I didn't buy the "Artbook" for space pictures, I bought it for the content I was promised.  There are [no] original words, [no] game development stories, and [no] "game introductions".  To be fair, there are more than five "exquisite" screenshots. . . but the whole PDF is nothing but screenshots. It doesn't need to be a PDF. I'd like to have seen the screenshots on their own, say in a folder, in a format one could read or use without PDF-software.  The space pictures look really nice. I'd use them for a background, if only they weren't stuck in a PDF document. The girl pictures look okay, but I can get similar (if not the same) pictures by just playing the game.  The issue with this DLC is false-advertising. Not only is the description wrong, but there are no screenshots which relate to this "DLC's" content. The content of this DLC seems a little underwhelming. . . I think that most people don't buy Attractorache for the space theme.
Pure walking sim that's less than 30 minutes long. Well intentioned and has good voice acting plus some historical accuracy, but everything's presented via a "white people and technology bad, native americans and nature good" filter. And wait till you hear the part where "Jeff Olson" talks about being a "merican, brah". If it wasn't for the in your face agenda it could have been OK, but there's really no reason to even bother with this. You can get a much more interactive and well balanced account of the impact of European settlement on the Midwest at any library.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!
I should've known better than to buy a game called DJ Whip but this game is not fun.  Very unpolished feels too amateurish to be attempting something like whip physics because here it is competely unsatisfying.
I never wanted this. For some reason it got added to my kart. You scammed me for 4 bucks for a radio station. The radio I mute. Thanks steam, paradox, who ever. this is stupid
A few funny joke spots here and there, but I wear this things started looping in under an hour.
base game music is better
Well, I'm sure the DLC is great, But i can't even play it. Every time i try and load a save, or make a new one my game crashes (without any assets or mods). My system specs exceed the recommended specifications, yet this game crashes not only itself, but Steam, and almost my whole computer. The great part is apparently i can't even get a refund because i have more than 8 hours *playing* this game. I guess that's my fault for trying to make this work rather than instantly refunding it 10 days ago. I am so disappointed.  EDIT: Also, forgot to mention, that ANY time i tried to load a save or make a new map it would freeze my PC for 10+ minutes at a time. I would be forced to wait it out because if i did anything it would crash my PC.
its makes my PC super lag, omg can i get a refund? Im not using anymods or anything.
Broke my game, zero population, flying cars. So many bugs with this one dlc
Basically not working if the city has Hadron Collider. DO NOT BUY if you plan to play with your fully developed city.
Requires a LOT of ram to run. I purchased it, played it, slow and freezing every 2 seconds, on a starting city. no mods no nothing.
I'm just going to not recommend this only because there is no mixed and for me personally this is not doing it. I can see others enjoying this dlc.  If you are the type of person that enjoys this game making good looking cites and/or a casual experience then yes its good. The campus areas are more of the same from parklife and industries. The buildings look great and this opens the doors for some amazing looking college focused cities and towns.  I play this game mainly for the traffic and city management... maybe I'm just playing this game wrong because it seems like the devs don't play this way. Building a campus in a city will pretty much print you money. I right now in my current city have a small Campus about 4k students and it generates me 11k profit on hard mode. I feel like this dlc breaks even more the already broken balance in this game. They keep adding these mini game like dlcs while some of the core game play mechanics like tax rates and unemployment that are still left pointless or underwhelming.  I very much enjoy other paradox games like ck2, eu4, and even surviving mars for there layer mechanics and challenging game play. This game falls flat is very easy and quite boring (traffic is great tho). I would very much like to see some cities politics, state/national relations, and some city related crisis out side disasters like economic depressions. This dlc is a glaring example of balance and gameplay being put on the back burner for a more toy model city like game (not that there is anything wrong with that if you like that).
Cities Skylines Campus keeps closing to desktop should have never bought it
free update is low profit but pity to be abandoned,and ruin the ipt2
The Campus DLC is broken, NO ONE will "Graduate" from elementary to high school and so on. I even started a New City with no special buildings, that hadron collider building makes the DLC universities OBSOLETE, so don't build them btw.. I waited Several game months, usually (before this DLC) the education system worked just fine, houses turned green showing they were Serviced, the houses now do not turn green, even with 50 elementary schools etc., Did no one TEST this dlc in house before publishing? So far I'm not happy. I will change from thumbs down to thumbs up if my Cims move up in the education system and got to the university I paid EXTRA for. I bought the $20 bundle... The radio stations, are MEH. Haven't even messed w/ the content creator stuff yet for Campus...
Bought it in a hurry on release day because it was 50% off by mistake. Looked at screenshots and realised it's American style university.  Not interested.  To dev: I was not mislead by promotional material, I simply wish you had made stuff that wasn't American.
Ricardo milos looks scuffed
unrealistic gameplay, ricardo doesnt moan when I hit him i cant recommend this game   7/10   Leather man  - "Im Cumming"
Utterly pointless
I've played this game for about 13 minuits and it gave me every achievement there is, idk if this is a bug but im happy it happened. Now i dont have to waste my time spanking hitler anymore <3
[h1]Review[/h1]  I only got this game for a friend i swear. Then he said you should buy it too. Well now we are here and i wrote a serious review on it.  [u]Gameplay[/u] In gachi heroes you spank asses of men from the gachimuchi meme. You get more money and you can unlock new spanking devices, auto spankers and unlock more spanking power in a skill tree that is almost as big as that one from path of exile. But you dont really need to, if you get auto clicker you can win the game in less than 5-10 minutes, if you click for real the whole time it takes you maybe 2 hours.   But most people arent here for the gameplay but rather than the meme right?  [u]Graphics[/u] The game features drawn men from the gachimuchi meme. The art is pretty good for what it is. The backgrounds are unique and change depending on the current song.  [u]Music[/u] Sadly i cant recommend it because of this. They didnt utilize the gachimuchi meme really here. Usually it features songs made up out of grunts of people from the gay porn videos but here its just some sort of distorted grunting. Its hard to explain but it gets nowere near the quality of the original. Also there arent many songs , i think around 5 only.  [u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u] Gachi heroes is a joke game that fails in a couple of areas that makes it a funny and good joke game. Therefore i cant really recommend it even as a joke game it falls flat.
Imma be honest, I bought this game hoping for meme emojis. That doesn't change the fact that it's the worst clicker I've ever played. It doesn't play itself offline which I thought was the cornerstone of clicker games and the skill tree is just plain bugged.
at the moment this game is not worth 25 euros, boring gameplay and there is nothing to do.
I have been gathering quite a collection of strange games. this definitely has to be the most adult of what i have so far. it has a lot of potential to be something cool, i mean the basic idea that the dev is pushing here even if you takee out the sex and nudity, would still be a great game, if it were at all implimented. basically you hunt down "wild" anthro's and youre supposed to be able to add them to the crew of your ship. i would imagine, eventually these beings would have base stats you could upgrade or modify to do certain tasks. there are talks of skills withing the character building like exploring, foraging, cannonry, shooting, swordplay. [your basic rpg skills] there are talks of clothing [this is one thing i would really like implimented] if you read into the meat of the game [or potential game] and get bast all of the adult themes. there are ideas here that would work great as a game all on its own. this is very early access, and i get that, but i do have to point out to the wary, that i am a bit upset over its price tag. against my better judgment here, i am not requesting a refund, because i am genuinely interested in seeing how they will develop this game further. as for right now, its still poorly optimised as far as performance goes. graphics look okay, character design kinda sucks and the options for character building is extremely limited as far as what my personal preferennces are although the environments are lush and beautiful, but again, the poor optimization makes me have to use low to med settings so i only turn it on when i would like to see it [at 5 fps]  as for now, i dont think i could call this a game but rather a concept, there just isnt enough content here to be called a game, i feel. furries arent really my thing, but i figured itd be an interesting add to my collection of niche games. i geuss i just wish by the time it reached early acsess on steam it had more than decently animated poorly rendered character models having sex in a field. ill be watching to see where this goes, but for now, it will likely stay uninstalled until the next major update
Ruffleneck.exe stops working or so it says. the game is at that state that it is unplayable i can't even launch the game as you can see already i'm unable to comment anything else please fix this.
i hate furry's
Please more optimization ! And russian language. My sistem: Core i7 7700, GTX1050TI, 16GB DDR4,
EDIT: The radio silence from the developers has ended and we've received news regarding upcoming changes and updates. This review may be altered in due time if this becomes a trend.=  *** TL;DR : This 'NO' recommendation is based on the current lack of features and updates. Subject to change if the game is actively developed further as it does have potential. ***  In its current state, I would not recommend the game to anyone -unless- you wish to contribute to the project, although it may not ever come to be. With the last official news being over two months ago now, there is no telling whether the project has been abandoned, was put on a low pitch or is still in active development.  Right now, the game offers little more than a bare-bones walking simulator, a couple of scenes, some dialogue and a single weapon to shoot with. With its adult theme being the main selling point (I reckon), the game currently has little more to offer than the plethora of Furry-themed adult games available for free on the internet - save perhaps that it is a Third-Person 3D game. With my 3.2 hours played only, I have been able to experience everything that the game currently has to offer - and the bulk of my time was spent on creating a character to my liking. The (character) graphics and animations are well done and I certainly enjoyed the hours I played the game — its just that right now there's little point doing more since there's simply nothing more to be done.  This is EA to the extreme: very promising if, and only if, it receives active, continuous development for a lengthy period of time and is not abandoned like the bulk of EA project here on Steam. Only time will tell.
tl;dr Not recommend. Good content, but not much of it! Try demo first. (was available at creators' web before) *** First, I would not call this a game or demo at the current state. It is more of a commercial for a game; all you do in-game is walk around and trigger animations which can be accessed in game without any actual gameplay.  A single large island for a map, "hunting", about two dozen adult animations, handful in-game characters, few buildings, some dialogue select options, and of course the lack of saving and in-game goals/tasks/missions... All of this can be experienced within half an hour, giving the average of 1$ per minute. This is just for illustration, but it shows my point well.   To not sound too negative, the character creation is decent and the models are done well (yet the faces still need a lot love :P). The environment is pretty detailed with a promise of future exploration. The animations are nicely done and overall a lot of time and care (and love again :P) went into the game; and the character dialogue interaction was a nice bonus. This alone can justify the current price for some, especially with all the content update that everyone is eagerly expecting at this point.  The half an hour I spent with the game I really liked and I don't regret the purchase. If you want to buy this game for future content certainly go ahead, but first try the free (old build) demo available at the creators' web page (or at least it was before) and see if it is worth your money. That's how I went about this.  I'll give it a "not recommend" for now, but it's a definitive thumbs up if you're into this "content" of the adult nature of the game.
Im unsure of the the game anymore, it has been a few months. I bought this game the second it came out because my friend told me about the beta and how it was on Patreon. I thought this would get content, like updates, or anything. This does nyot happen, instead from what the Patreon says, there are 4 versions and you paying $32 on steam is nyot good enough to gain you anything other than about 12 animation, Most of the without sound and multipule broken meshes, tongues poking through the jaw etc. i thought this game had gotten updates from time to time, but there i checked my steam downloads and found out there has nyot been a single update. i understand that to create a game takes time, and money, but when you promise a product, you must deliver. It would be nice if the steam build, the build you have to play 30+ dollars for would grant you access to all the content. I understand too that the keys are nyot something you want to just hand out but i dont want to pay double the price for the game i was promised. Overall i purchased this game with low expectations and they have all nyot been met i know its a unity game ive used unity, its annoying as hell! but thats no excuse to never update the game you published for 30+ dollars which i bought the litteral second it came out giving a total discount of $2. I would remove this comment and probably would give a good comment if the game Dev would give out the keys to the new content to those that want to test what the new feature have to offer and give an option to nyot use the key if you rather a safe build.
As the game currently is, its not in beta. Its not in alpha. I wouldn't even describe it as a demo. You can walk around, and suck a guy off. There is no amount of content and mechanics the developers could add in a reasonable time that would justify you buying it now for its $30 price tag. If it was $5 or $10, that'd be more appropriate for what you're really buying here; a promise. A promise that if you give the developer your money now, they'll give you a game later.
I have been hurt by the developers greatly, last night was so terrible. I feel like they deserve to give me my money back, I got banned on their forum because of something that did, something that did not even take place here on Steam. And even after attempting to say I was sorry, they turned their back on me.  I have a lot of problems, ya but so do a lot of other furries. They are part of the reason the fandom is not as safe as you would think, they hurt my feelings and they made me look like a cancer.  I only wish in this fandom to make friends, even if I am not as good at it as I should be. I can say this much stay away from theses monsters. If they invite me back to their group again I am going to so no, they already caused to much damage.  If I go back to them on their Discord server, they most likely will do the same thing again.  edit : the screenshots confirming the event. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1639422822  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1638863183 Also the post that was picked, did not even have any violation in it. It's kind of funny right, I mean come on. Any other post could have been better, I mean the hell is wrong with them. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1639380790  Hunt And Snare Review and report - updated 2-14-19 Still runs bad in fact I think it might run worse then before.  The new animations are better but the old ones still look bad like the hand job one and a few others looks like they are giving you a hot dog rub without even hitting the gland.  The gun bug is still there but it does not de-spawn environmental objects anymore, however it still glitches the sky up however. Still fires off two shots when doing it.  Unfortunately it seems there is still places you can get stuck and are unable to get out of like the houses in town when you get on the roofs. How hard can it be to make the roofs have Collision.  The catching prey cursor is still laughably invisible meaning you can't tell where to hover over to activate it.  It looks like most of the bugs I helped you find are still there even if they should be really easy to fix.  Hunt And Snare Review and report - updated 2-8-19   [h1] Graphics[/h1]  	Awful trash, let me just say that the models for both canis and felis are ugly as all can be, the main problem I have with them is the body shape and lack of body types over all.  A point to make is that the ears are to goofy looking and also brake when the game slows down and believe me it does a lot. I look at art from other furs all day long, I almost never find people liking Dumbo jumbo ears or using ears that are oversized, and also stick out from the side of the head.  Don’t get me wrong I feel as if having the Dumbo ears like that as an option is nice but I really can’t say I like it to much. My other friends I have shown the game to also say that are very unappealing.  One of my friends even said they look like racoons that fell into a pond with toxic waste and started to walk on two legs. There is nothing charming or a turn on with the current low grade designs.  I end up looking at the privates more than anything else, and for me I look at the whole picture normally when I am viewing images from FE or E 621.  [h1] Gameplay[/h1]  	Where to begin on gameplay? OK so I find that it feels like that person's first gamemaker game with how it handles jumping and collisions. It is amazing that they released this onto Steam with it not even being one tenth of a game let alone controls that suck, and a system to enslave your furry to do your bidding that almost never works, until you find out they have a cursor that’s invisible you have to place over them first.  How Valve let this mistake onto Steam with all of theses problems is beyond me, I understand they let sexual stuff on Steam now but come on now.  [h1] Rant[/h1]  My recommendation is that you unindex this game from Steam to elevate your team from further embarrassment, until you have a game that’s at least 66% of a beta or more then don’t even bother.  My ending summary is that there is a lot of things I have to say about theses devs, thankfully they can rest knowing I will only say somethings to friends I trust. Also I have information on the devs that can further prove that this project is doomed, I really don’t think they can save it. I believe that they have zero resolve to improve and they think money can fix everything.  We will just get new devs, we will just bring more people onto the team, give me a brake. I can say that no matter how many people you can bring onto this project you can’t make it any better, look at other games that came out in recent years they had big teams of a lot of people and they sucked really hard core.  Without a project leader that knows what they are doing you will not finish, and even if you do it will be a big mistake.
unplayable so far i have uninstaled and re installed the game twice i run a hispec rig so ino my rig isnt the problem but as far the game is unplayable i cant even start from loading the game im welcomed buy pink screen that is all when there is finaly movement it crashes ....refund!!!!
The game is a beginner, all right, but you can not save the current game is a mistake .
Dont buy it at this moment of time as there is just a demo of what could be a great game here.
It's a bit pricey for a porno game when I can just go and play Rack 2 which has a much more versatile and better sex scenes available for viewing pleasure. I can't see why I spent 30$ on this lol other than that though. The sex scenes were ok except for the part where I was getting fucked when I wanted to top but no, I get fucked by a woman with a cock in the ass and that was no beuno.
First and foremost I Do Not recomend this game, if you are looking for a game.  There isnt one here, not yet.  Id considered this a very "pretty" demo at best.  The only way i'd recomend that you spend money on this at the moment, is if your wanting a game like this, and hope / trust that these people will follow through and actually provide a fun game with content worth playing.  At the moment, none of that is there.  Pros:  Really Really large world space, beautiful art work with trees ground clutter, water, sky etc.           what few character models there are to choose from, are very customizable, and look really nice.           Animation: whats there, walking, running, swimming, single loop animations; all look decent to good, no clipping or               any other ackwardness worth mentioning.  Cons: 95% of the world space is just empty, nothing to "hunt", no buildings, nothing but empty wilderness, if you travel far           enough the LoD starts to become buggy, not fading out fast enough and you start seeing floating trees and such           that start popping into place.  The longer you travel the slower the LoD gets replaced with the actual trees and           cover until half the stuff around you is the LoD models, instead of the trees there supposed to be.           Only 2 character models to play with and even though there are a decent amount of customizations (colours,           patterns, some scaling) some obvious customizations are just strangely missing, such as hair styles, different ears,           different body shapes in general, and in particular on the adult parts.           Animations: ugh all the fun stuff is single looping stage only.  there are no "acts" that start and finish, think more like           animated emojies, just more fluent.  If your still reading this far, I'd say odds are you wanted this game to be good too!  And I can honestly say I have a feeling that this could be an awesome game.  As a demo I would consider it extremely well polished, enough so that if they were asking me to back them I would.  There's enough work here to show that they are serious, and not just tossing something out there, and trying for a cash grab.  That said, they should have posted it up as such, not as an early release game.... cause all thats going to do is upset alot of people when they buy it, turn around and demand refunds (because there is no way this could be considered a $30 game) and leave bad reviews.  I'll not ask for a refund, as Im just going to consider this a "supporting the cause" donation.  My last though on this "game" and alot of other games being released lately under this model is that all in all its a bad business model.  People should not be trying to "make a living" off the game they are trying to create.  Its like selling ears of corn to people when all you have is some dirt, an old tractor, and a bag of seeds. More and more Early Access really means, maybe someday, if your lucky, instead of okay here is a fully playable game, but we got more ideas we are still working on.
There's definitely alot of work put into the game and looks good, but unfortunately after trying about a half hour of the game and seeing how absolutely bare bones are it is with almost no characters, or seemingly any missions in place . I'd recommend give it a bit more time for stuff to be added and will update the review once stuffs added. Though for right now for what little is in the game definitely not worth paying anywhere remotely near 30 dollar asking price.
Okay so the game just won't load in. Maybe it is the ratio or maybe it is the use of custom charaters but I can play. I want to hold onto it. It seems really interesting, and it being earily access means there is room to improve
This game OVERheats my graphic card faster and more on low graphic settings  than FF15 on medium settings would I am not sure why the world has to be so huge given the content of it currently fits on 1/25 of the world map just fine.  Currently this game eats way too much resources for little to no content so far. Fix the performance, then more content can be applied
[h1]I have no title for this...[/h1]  Let me begin with a quote from the DEV here so that you have already a good overview from the game:  [b]„This is a game where you run around, nude (...), with a tranquilizer gun, and only with tranquilizer gun (...), to hunt, other, nude, furrys, in the wild (...), to stun them, and fuck them, literally ^^„[/b]  [h1]„This is the next furry generation, literally.“[/h1]  Yes, Hunt and snare is basicly like this: You run around as naked „civilised“ furry (cough...), equiped only and ONLY with a tranquilizer gun to „hunt“ aka STUN other, WILD naked furrys ...and fuck them.  [b]Thats basicly the gameplay.[/b]  [h1]„Do NOT tell me the creator of the game does NOT see what hes doing. DO NOT TELL ME THAT...“[/h1]  You see, im a furry myself or i WOULD have at least call myself a furry before i knew about this game exists. I would even go so far and say [b]i lost the „touch“ to the fandom as soon as i had the contact to the creator of this game, which also calls himself a furry...sadly. coz if this would be a troll game it wouldnt be half pathetic as it is right now...[/b]  I already [b]t-r-i-e-d[/b] to explain myself to the dev which BANNED me from the steam game forum for being honest about this game, [b]which is pretty much a open dinner plate for every person AND troll out there, stereotyping the WHOLE furry fandom as it is.[/b]  [h1]But whats with the game self now?[/h1]  Sure, before someone says or askes, yes, there is sure effort behind this game and you can sure see that in the animations which are smooth and the opinions to customize your characters are really HUGE for that kind of game [b](srsly here, hats down)...[/b] BUT thats pretty much all ruined by the logic the dev has and doesnt care nor see the big deal or problem with it. As i quote the dev again [b]„I actually got the idea because I think hunting games are an interesting concept, but pretty boring in the end, there's no thrill besides sitting in the woods with a quack whistle in your mouth, but combined that with porn? That is the "real" hunting!„[/b]  So image following... Youre a normal person who runs around with a weapon which is able to stun people. [b]Youre in THAT „need“, you begin to shot random people and fuck them.[/b]  How would you call that? I give you 3 lines for thinking...    If your answer wasnt R-A-P-E or slavery by now and you think its normal to shot someone, stun them and fuck the living sheat out of them then [b]you might have a srsly mental problem or youre really one of „those“ furries which, i quote, „wanna go into the next forest and wanna fuck the next animal they see“.[/b]  As i said already and, again, t-r-i-e-d to explain to the dev, and i quote myself now [b]„You cant make this shit up! you can even replace the furrys here with humans or ANIME if you want to change the fact or topic, the IDEA of it is just sick and i mean with sick REALLY sick, not in a good way at all.“[/b]  And no, you cant change this fact about the core of the game, this -IS- literally a R-A-P-E simulator just „without violance“ [b](HOW anyways if you STUN THEM???)[/b]. It supports „having sex with S-T-U-N-E-D people“, there is nothing to „cutey talk“ that or do you want me to post the advertising banners from Furaffinity as ONE sample~?  But whats the problem about this? For the most part 3:  First the dev & the people who really „need“ this game say for the most time,  i quote „if you're not interested in adult games (or furry games), you can filter them out on Steam!„ Yes, that IS true. [b]I could just ignore the game and move on and it wouldnt be a big deal – But that DOES NOT change the fact that THIS game exists and stereotypes a WHOLE fandom im kinda „in touch with“ ffs.[/b]  Second would be that people try really H-A-R-D to defend this game, [b]even SO hard that someone REALLY compared it with the Playboy Magazine and the girls in the bunny cosplays in there.[/b]  I dont know how to explain it but how can you have the SHAME to compare a professional adult magazine where you see cute women posing in a bunny COSPLAY, sexy lingerie, NAKED or like with a game where you play around as „hunter“, SHOT your victims and FUCK them?  [b]I never thought i have to use a quote from another Video game here but tbh, there is a difference, a huge one and if you cant see it, let me try to use this quote here  "I'm not a crazed gunman, Dad, I'm an assassin. The difference being one is a job and the others mental sickness!" ~ TF2 Sniper in „Meet the Sniper“[/b]  [h1]„Im legit stuned. People really need AND defend this?“[/h1]  The last problem is that the dev really thinks, hes in the right and im just someone in the fandom who „wants this game getting of steam“. As i said already, he banned me from the steam forum for being honest and tried to deface me on his OFFICIAL game twitter account, called me „hypocrite“ coz im also a furry who draws also adult art.  [b]Yes, i am a furry artist, yes, i draw furry adult art but there is, again, a small difference between that what i am doing and the dev is doing and since i was already good with quotes, here is another[/b]  [b]„What he doesnt think about, there is a huge difference between "i post furry porn" on the sides which are made FOR furrys and "i post furry porn" on a side which is for sure NOT made for it. its the same if i would be a nazi and say "SIEG HEIL" around other nazis or i go into the open and do the same.  What the dev just do is deflecting the problem they might create "soon" with it, trying to tolerate it by saying "if you dont like it, dont look at it" but the problem is, people are FREE to look at what they want and look at it HOW they want. they can complain, create REVIEWS (which im sure they will~), record videos about, etc.“[/b]  In other words: [b]i dont „hurt someone“ (depends~) if i post the stuff which is suppost for the people on pages which ARE suppost FOR SAID people like furry art on furry pages or anime art on anime pages.[/b]  With that said, yes, [b]all the other titles i used HERE were quotes by FURRIES which i have shown the thread i made in the forum, the twitter posts & the following which i will also now show to you guys so you have a better view of the whole thing and the „mindset“ of the dev.[/b]  Yes, there are people who defend this game and if you look at said people on the twitter posts as sample, [b]they are creators of other porn games of „that“ kind or porn movies who didnt do much better („you wanna bang~?“).[/b]  Again said, Yes, im (or „was“) a furry, i draw adult art but if you try to compare at least „my“ art with a GAME ON STEAM which is about HUNTING OTHER FURRYS TO STUN AND FUCK THEM, [b]you should know that i at least „try“ to keep T-H-E masquerade the furry fandom is doing intact and not being one of the persons who actually „WOULD“ fuck a animal for real.[/b] Next to this, [b]I, at least, can stop drawing such stuff from one day to the other since i only DRAW it.[/b]  Enjoy reading this story as whole here and again, i have no pity for people who need this game for real, the dev who might doesnt see what hes creating here or the people who really try to defend it and are THAT naiv...  Additional backstory & opinion (worth reading, really) : https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/957475341967681240/F6B9C479899197BDCC84598F3905DF4D0A5BC146/ Original thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/944330/discussions/0/1741100729957292006/  Im done here, and i sure refund it (mostly coz it doesnt really work...). [b]If you really need this game and you ARE a furry and think this is „OK“ for real, you should think about if youre not the one with a mental problem. Im dead serious.[/b]  This has nothing to do with „being a snowflake“ nor „SJW“ but [b]tell me how would you like to defend yourself AS furry now, getting called that furrys only wanna fuck the next animal they see, if you know this game exists~? I didnt got a good answer so far FROM THE DEV, thanks.[/b]
It sounded so cool ... but it's actually not fun at all.
ass
This game don't works correctly, don't spend money on it!
Game has issues, can't use items which makes the game pointless because you will eventually die unless you keep going to inns. I was looking forward to this game and while trying to find a way to use an item in different ways it gave me an error.
I can't really tell you how the game is due to the fact that as soon as you leave the first town the first enemy encounter kills you.  It is so unballanced that there is no way to go thru the game since you die every five steps.  I have never encountered this in a game before.
Unplayable. You can't alter the controls.
the girls are cute but unless you love tile flipping this game gets old real fast I got completely stuck within 30 minutes  can't recommend
No saves, just checkpoints, so a game should be completed in one sitting. But it is rather large, at it is not a walking sim. It is a hard FPS.
Nice graphics but  overall poor gameplay. You have to gun down speedy zombies with wacky ragdoll physics in an effort to take your friend Jackie the Basketball (think Wilson from Castaway) to Jamestown, VA, where there's apparently a haven from the zombies. The game is only five levels long and so hard that it's essentially impossible to beat without exploiting the AI There are serious bugs, one of the worst being that sometimes a zombie will be invisible.  You have to run away, then spew bullets behind you when you hear the zombie or look for it kicking zombie corpses asside as it charges towards you. There's no health indicator in most levels, and the only HUD is an ammo count about half the size of the font in a teephone book! The best part of the game is the first level, where you run and jump across the rooftops of a city destroyed by the zombies and the character has a fair bit of spoken dialogue.Every level except the annoying driving one will end with you standing atop a car or rock as dumb zombies swarm on the ground, unable to reach you. Could have had potential, but ridiculously hard and too amateurish to be much fun.
More shovelware garbage on steam. Getting killed out of nowhere through the floor. Ive seen these assets and models before in other games. Probably a unity asset pack. Take Jackie your basketball friend to the human settlement for water and cookies.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2YY5XpjK3g&feature=youtu.be   The game is alright under a buck. I actually repurchased it and was able to fnish it. Here is a walkthrough if you get stuck.  Good Cheap.
Game is too short even for 60 cents
Hmm, this is a tough one. On the one hand, this game was really short but on the other hand, it's also really cheap. This game has the world's worst flashlight but it also had a few scares that I won't spoil. It's mainly a keycard and battery finding simulator and I think the flashlight has been made terrible on purpose to pad out the games length but I can't be sure of that. One thing I do know is that, I didn't hate it as much as everyone else but it is still insanely short and the flashlight is really bad.   I'm really stuck on whether or not to recommend this one. I think I'm going to have to say Not Recommended but it's close. I really feel like this one should be in the middle somewhere. I will say once the game price goes up over $1 I don't think it will be worth it. But if it's under a buck then take a chance on it. You might be disappointed but it's really very little to spend on a game.   I made a video if you're curious about the gameplay:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplQACxuMXo
terrible. needs more batteries, end up trapped in the dark too much. nice try though
The idea of this story has potential to be interesting, but the writing is flat and rushed. There's no time given to the characters or the situations given. There are some great ideas here that I believe could be really entertaining if they were taken more slowly, and if more thought were put into how these characters would act as if they were actual people. Unfortunatly, our characters are tools of plot and most of this games problems come down to lack of time given.
I liked the concept and the different branches, but a lot of the story feels more like exposition and it’s really hard to bond with the characters as we hardly spend time with them. There’s not a lot of time to truly connect and the romances have a ‘strangled by the red string’ feel. That being said there’s a lot of branches and different ways to do the story so you’ll get your money’s worth on the sale if you’re okay with all the expositions and the sparing use of dialogue. If you’re looking for a character driven story that allows you to bond with said characters--which is what I'm personally into--you won’t get much here.
Ran terribly, combat really floaty. refunded
Ive never reviewed a game before but im sorry devs, but this is the boringist dumbest, worst, pile of crap i have ever played, the game doesnt even work at all and is in chinese and your selling it for 40 dollars, no, this game shouldnt have ever been made. Im sorry but literal garbage, do not waste time and money buying this game
This is one of the most disappointing games GameHouse created, I completed the game 3 times just to make the right choices (thanks to Google) to get the Newton achievement. You can't replay a level to change your choice, once it's locked you have to start the game over to change it (which is ridiculous). The graphics is so weak, I had an expectation that it would be good if you look at the main screen. But the people is not in proportion, the story didn't hook me at all, at one point I got super bored and frustrated. Then you get your daily challenge as well, that is just annoying. The game is better without it, I wish I could get my money back because the story just doesn't get better and in my opinion it's not even worth buying. Some of the levels lagged as well, were I had to play a challenge level caring for the animal 20 times just to pass it. I'm not buying the upcoming Dr. Cares, because it's like the game developers ran out of a story and graphic design. I won't even recommend this game to anyone!!
OKAY This game's art is actually suck.  Art looks like everything is get from internet, Gameplay is really bad and navigation is bad too... Dull game play, every thing is dark in game.  Not even a "ADULT ONLY" game. REFUNDED.
The Artwork is disappointing, and the gameplay dull.   Currently no achievements.   Am hoping its either rushed or lazy rather than someones best attempt to make a game.
Guns and Ghosts is one of the worst games I've ever played. It's bugged to high hell, it's impossible to see 10 feet in front of you, the level design is horrid, and not once did I see a single enemy despite the character spouting off dialogue about killing ghosts. I can normally find some level of enjoyment in this kind of asset flip of a game, and I normally don't leave lengthy reviews, but I need to get it off my chest how absolutely dreadful this abortion of coding is. What little respect I had for this lousy excuse for a game studio has been completely eradicated, and I refuse to support this kind of disgraceful, repulsive developer ever again. I doubt the developers will ever read this, but if by some miracle they do, I ask you to stop making games. Just stop.
nah
When i stumbled over this game - it seemed a nice approach to the genre. Even aware that is EA at this point in time it as best a unbalanced - random frustration - due to ingame prices are to high - rent rises to fast - and even after 3 weeks you never started a game development due to trying to stay alive, pay your rent and grinding money with freelance jobs which are giving you almost no revenue to get a decent start. so most time i starve or getting bankcrupt  which should be not the case if the patches would target anything of those, even if that would be rebalanced after the game hit a decent point where you could belive it is stable and fine. Until that point reaches there will be no better review.
Very grindy without any reward.   There is not much management to do in this game, you have to spend 2 hours of your time just to be reach the point where you can actually develop a game (rest is freelancing, aka clicking multiple times on work on freelance and wait for the progress bar to fill). Developing a game consists of choosing how much time to dedicate to gameplay/story/soundtrack/graphics, followed by clicking on work on game development and some more waiting. When the game is ready to be published, you get random reviews and a few bucks back. That's it.  Cannot recommend in this state, lacks any kind of depth or fun gameplay loop.
The game has so much potential to be good but right now it is frustratingly impossible to play. The repetitive beginning is so frustrating and it seems as if there is no guide to how the skills line up with the genre of game you are choosing. I think some sort of WIKI would be great for this game so it could guide the players on how to get started and how to build a foundation for your character in the game. There is a lot of potential but it's almost like the developer rushed the release. I hope this game gets better but for now I'm done playing until some more updates are released.
This game is ruined by artifical diffculty.  The amount of sheer grinding to even get to the point where you can just make a game is ridiculous (over an hour for me).   Cost ratios are terrible. Rent occurs every seven days or so and goes up ridiculously quickly.  You get 45 dollar for a task that takes all day, but pizza doesnt even fill you (65/100 hunger) costs 20 bucks and takes one of your six daily action points to accomplish.  Energy never hits 100 percent and is capped at 70.  Your playable energy level is between 70 and 50 (for the first two hours for me).  Every action points takes energy.   Coffee costs an action point to make.  Getting to the point where you can actually make a game is tedious and such a terrible grind that it's not worth it.  Then, you get maybe 100 or so first your first game.  I think I got 112 for the first in total sales and 147 for my second game.    The game could be fun, but the unrealisitc grind combined with no difficulty levels makes it pretty terrible at this point. If they continue to keep these ratios for compensation/food as well as the actions points, I dont see it getting better no matter what they do.    After about two hours of game play on a very simple game, I'm not much better off than I was when I started.   I would avoid this game or look at a video to see if it's worth your time.
Way too buggy. Somehow died of starvation despite having 40 sat in the positives.
The game is really cute and i love all the designs of the birds and the art is lovely! However, I cannot recommend this game since it lacks a ton of polish, and isn't worth its price tag. Don't get me wrong, the game is cute and i can tell how much passion went into it, but it isn't finished. i do believe these things could improved upon in the future, but for now i'm just gonna write out some issues i had and some recommendations on how the game could be improved. (just my opinion btw.)  -one of the biggest things: music. There is no music in any of the minigames or on the titlescreen. Also hardly any sound effects in the game. There should almost always be some sort of music playing, and sound effects should be EVERYWHERE! when you hover your mouse over buttons, in the minigames, when you click on birds, when you give them treats or hats and a special one plays when you give them one they love!! sound effects!!! everywhere!!!!  -the only games I actually played were the match 3 game and the fruit delivery game. The fruit delivery game was super cute, visually pleasing, and overall really fun. The downside is you don't make any feathers off of it, which kinda makes the game pointless. The match 3 game is cute, but i wish there was more added to make it more exciting (of course music, add a ton of different bird blocks, etc.) all of the other games felt really barebones and boring.   - feathers take waaaaaaaaaay too long to farm.   - The story was cute, but really uninteresting. though i think thats just because i dont care about the characters at all. which is a shame cause i love their designs so much! i felt no connection with them at all and they had almost no personality. yes they have hobbies and quirks but they felt like such a brick wall to talk to. (also im slightly confused on why when talking to them your treated as an actual person in the garden, but at all other times its treated like you dont exsist. i feel more like an observer rather than a person interacting with the characters and birds.)  - just a few minor animation quirks on the birds, and a glitch where id blow my whistle, the new birds would come, id go buy something from the shop only to return to the birds that were there from before i blew my whistle  I feel like so much more personality could be put in this game! So many things could be refined and tweaked and added that would make it stand out so much more!!! but for now, even though its super cute, it feels unfinished and unrefined. I probably wont be opening it again unless some big updates come out.
Although the art is fantastic, the aesthetic is relaxing and the vibes are very cute, this is at present not a 7 dollar game. It's time gated, the games are boring and clunky, and there is nothing to do with this game after the first 10 minutes other than open it, check your bird for its poop, and then close it. I recommend getting the Tiny Bird Garden for mobile (which is free) which includes everything the PC version does minus the bad mini games. It's obvious this game was intended to be an idle game like Neko Atsume so enjoy it on mobile as its intended instead of the mess it is here on Steam.
Tiny Bird Garden Deluxe is a fun, intriguing, adorable game that's only fault is the platform it was released on. I've never been a fan of idle games, but I am even less a fan of idle games on PC. And despite the minigames or the story, this is still at heart an idle game. In addition, the in-game currency is almost painfully slow to gain, making it so that even if you check back several times a day, you can only buy a handful of items daily.   I have played the original Tiny Bird Garden on my phone. This version is much closer to Neko Atsume, almost identical actually. I think if they had simply updated the original game to match this one- Or released this version on phone, even paid- it would be all over a fantastic game. I simply just don't have the motivation to boot up my computer just to check and see if my baby bird has left more poop all over her room for me.   TL;DR You'll enjoy the first 30 minutes, but then resign yourself to the free mobile version anyways. Don't waste the money.
when there is only one server available in the list, and I tried to join it, "can't join because the game is in progress" ....... So, if you don't have friends that are going to play the same game with you.. just don't buy it..
Asset flip. Plain and simple. Gameplay is mediocre without enough features to justify being anything but a f2p.   Devs readily admit to using stock assets they purchased, and when asked if when they had more experience modeling (as their reason of their original assets being less-than-desireable seemed sympathetic enough) they implied that simply having original assets meant it would be a "triple a level game" To quote the dev with some paraphrasing: "well it's just a 2 dollar game made by 2 dudes. It doesn't need to be on the level of triple a games" It might be a decent time, but it's still an asset flip at the core.  Don't spend your dosh.
I don't remember seeing that this was a beta release or still in testing, but, overall it's ropey as hell.  Sometimes, the menu doesn't work which isn't a good sign.  Also, there's a bit in the middle of the map that tells me to prees A.  When I do, my character in the background moves left... I think they mean press E as that opens a menu. Don't buy this if you're expecting a smooth game, maybe in a few weeks or months they'll have sorted out some bugs... seriously, the menu works sometimes, but half the time it just doesn't respond or only lets you choose some of the options. It's got potential though.  I'm abandoning it for now and will come back to it in a few months when hopefully it will be more complete.  For now though, I don't think they should be charging anything for it.
For me the issue is the lag. Even tho specs show that i can run it. So please fix the lag.
This game is very cheap, but that is it's only quality. It is very laggy, even with a few zombies, do not expect it to run smoothly on a laptop, even a good one. The game itself is not fun and badly translated (at least for French).
nothing but good UI.
Lags alot and nobody plays on multiplayer.
Well, the time has come. I have to write a negative review for a Zeiva game. I love these games. I think they're emotionally great. This one, I wasn't into. It wasn't funny or charming. I was just boring. I've heard all the jokes before, so Cliché is pretty cliche. Like I said, I love Zeiva games and look forward to every new one. This one, didn't grab me.
Dev didn't reply my questions for clarification for type of gameplay, achievements, endings and estimated playtime on tumblr(I asked only yesterday evening(it's noon now), but considering the fact that the dev was online for a while after that, I admit to being a bit disappointed that the dev hasn't replied), so beware if you get technical issues or want a more thorough explanation/involved developer.   Update: Dev replied me. They are working on a demo and a website now. Direct quote: There are 9 endings(with variation 15). Estimated time one playthrough is about 3-4 hours.   I didn't experience any technical issues.....the gameplay just felt a bit, monotonous to me. I bought this because the other review mentioned finding this game funny after just a few minutes into the game....but I was a bit irked by the personality of Manly to be honest, another reason why it wasn't as fun as I expected it to be.   It's just not my cup of tea. Try it out if you wish.
There are two aspects to this game. Cards, and porn. Somehow, it fails at both.  The main game play is, in short, a slog. Round time is bogged down by uneccessarily long animations with absolutely no options for speeding up play, which we'll get more into a bit later. The game featured is Blackjack, which should be really simple. But the game asigns arbitrary values to face cards that completely ignore modern rules. Besides this, the game will miscount cards frequently. Additionally, a serious case of "The Computer is a cheating bastard!".  Even following a safe bet on 16, hold on 17, the CPU will get a card that they need, usually to get them to 20/21, a vast majority of the time. I have serious doubts about the game being random.  The slow and frustrating pace of game play does little to help the overlying problem of price, value, and what you receive. For every game you win, you get one coin. If you lose, you get no coins. There is absolutely no way to increase how many coins you get per win, or at all. You win, and you get your coin, and that's it. In the shop, a couple of characters cost 10 coins, a majority cost 25, and a couple of items are 50. It took me well over 100 games with this bullshit system to farm out for the very first character that actually shows you what you bought the game for, 10 coins. 100+ games. You could do the math, but I'll just tell you the answer. It's not fun. That's the answer.  Oh, you didn't know? That's right. Despite being a pornographic game that you must PAY FOR, Blackjack of strip will make you jump through hoops to see stripping of any kind. The first two characters you start with have absolutely zero featured nudity. Those characters will act like bashful teenagers and cover everything in a blushing blaze. To see anything worth seeing, you have to buy one of the 10 coin characters. Remember, it's only about 100 games. The real grind is for the deck of "naked" girls, who, yes, every single one, wears underwear.  And all of this could possibly be forgivable if the developers gave any care to their game or their customers, but they do not. Despite suggestions outstanding for a year, there has been zero changes to the game. Whatever interest in this game I had died long ago with an inactive, uncaring team.  Don't waste your time.
The game does not even know how to count the cards properly. two tens and a five it says i have 14. it isn't even consistant in it's miscounting.  Needs alot of work. I can't recommend it in its current state.  Edit: seems as though Jacks are worth 2, Queens 3 and Kings 4. Aces are always 11. This is why the scoring is wonky. Not sure why they chose not to use Blackjack's actual rules.

Very over-priced. This game is junk. A bunch of assets thrown randomly in a room for you to find.   The interface is poor, mouse speed is painfully slow, there's no setting for it, you have to hold right-mouse button to look about, like why on earth would you not just use mouse look? And because RMB has to be held, the mouse-cursor ends up at the edges of the screen so when you actually want to click something you have to bring it back to the center of the screen manually, it's a mess. There's not even a custom mouse cursor.  Instead of offering a choice of the TWO rooms when you start, instead they've put that in settings. FML.  There are no achievements, so there's very little reason to play this game.  How do you make a HOG less enjoyable? Stick a timer on it, make movement difficult and restrict your view by giving you a torch that you can;t even move around easily.  Summary: fail, I wouldn't recommend this game even for 10c.
its trash i did the mission and the game mode is fun and new then idid the same thing 5 times and im liek dose it ever progress or is it jsut 3 bucks for one mission you get to paly as much as you want with a little leader board and no real rewards
Many thanks for the next "B.u.l.l.s.h.i.t-DLC" !!! @NeocoreGames   OVER and OUT !
GOOD MISSION layouts and diffrent types of missions but the reward is ice foot prints they look like frost giant shit spike drops so ya its fun but reward is so not worth it
At the begining of the priority mission you are given 3 options that will influence the baseline for your chance of success. The results are messed up and don't match what you've picked. Also, framerate drop below 24fps on a i7 with a gtx1080ti. Footprints are okay-ish.
Massively EA.  It'll get you about ~10 minutes or so of gameplay from start to finish that is severely unpolished in just about every aspect save for the combat which is a half-decent reminder of Dark Souls.  Even though the price is only a quid and this project is marked as Early Access, it still doesn't validate it as an actual game. There's just not enough content and diversity to speak of an actual game over say a work-in-progress [insert game engine] project that someone fiddled around with for a couple of hours, mashing some stuff together to see if it works.  Could this become a very nice Souls-inspired Indie game some day if it received continues updating and polishing for a lengthy period of time? Perhaps. Right now it just isn't enough to be considered a game any more than a display of progress.
things to do are very limited and you die very easily 
The game is in 'Early Access', a way of saying 'We havent actually made a game yet, but we would like your money all the same'. You fuckers better finish this piece of shit. Polish this turd until it shines! Polish it until it shines with the light of one thousand suns and then roll it in glitter 'till it sparkles like Garry!  Seriousely guys, making games is hard, I know because I had a crack at it myself for a few years and all I managed to make was garbage. I sincerely hope you succeed where I failed. Work hard. And God Speed. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1587330113
this game needs quit a few things such as optimization why optimization well because my system iis running an rx 460 thing is within the 6 todal miniuts my rx 460 was at all times 100% usage and reached over 60C keep in mind in just 6 min that is pretty bad also considering the fact that game has horrible graphics it makes you wonder were all of that gpu usage is going better made character modles would be good mainly the main character  more structers and plant life would also make the game alot more playable  and for crying out loud try to make some cutsenes they add deapth to the world   i know i only paid a dollar for this but if your going to try to make a game no matter what do your best to show off the world that the character is in just adding texures and structers to the terrain those two alone will make for a more playable experiance  
This game would be awesome { I need it to have good controls } I dont know what the story is because it has no way to move next to next since the game was built in a different language i guess it has no way of knowing because the controls are so horrible plus hit stun is some serious problem in this game. Fix that and ill reccomend!
At the beginning i was in love with this game after i found nathan and then after i hated it, after texting for a damn hour i cant get the idiot to go upstairs. Hes got an IQ of a squirrel. I love the idea but seriously this dude cant follw directions to save his life. you go to bedroom that has the locked closet but god forbid this idiot go upstairs to look for a damn key. he really likes looking at a tv for some reason. But the idea is awesome and i wish this guy could follow simple instructions
Seemed to be pretty glitchy for me, i couldnt get past the first task without getting caught up
I bought this and whenever I start it, an error message pops up saying something about runtime closing it. I emailed the support a few days ago and have not gotten a response.
[h1]It's a good game, though it can get very repetitive and boring.[/h1] [u]Mostly repetitive and boring[/u] you have to grind a lot as well.
This is a really niche game and the series has been something I just really adored. I loved the original Tasty Planet and was thrilled to play the sequel when I found it. However, this game, I just can't recommend.  It's got some QoL stuff such as no longer being limited by time, as long as you finish you unlock the next level (however, bonus levels are locked by collected stars which require you to do well anyways). That's about the only advantage it's got over other games.  Tasty Planet Forever features multiple characters (they're functionally the same, it's literally just a skin) and for this reason, it feels inferior to the previous games. Each character has an origin story, some comic showing where it came from, and that's all you get. The character eats everything and then you move on to the next character. There's just a lack of continuity and closure. This is the kind of game that wouldn't really need it, however as previous games had some kind of story, the lack of it in Tasty Planet Forever feels lazy.  The actual level design itself also feels a bit like a downgrade. The final Grey Goo level had Nebula's, a purple and green one, three growth stages in a row. The exact same icon. Earlier stages featured mountains and craters over and over again across like 2-3 stages.  I can't recommend this game purely because I feel that the previous games are superior and that you should purchase those instead.
First time playing with a controller in single player worked fine then suddenly the controller stopped working in single player. what caused it to stop working?
I wanted to give this game a positive review. Really I did, I loved the previous two Tasty Planet games, Tasty Blue as well. But wow, did this game disapoint. Especially when I found out what the ending was.  Don't get me wrong, the controls and the graphics are just like the other games and they look as fine as ever, but what drove me nuts were both the cutscenes and the stages themselves.  The cutscenes, there's bulidup, but never pay off. It started with the two scientists, which were huge staples in both the first two games [spoiler] Including the final chapter of Tasty Blue	[/spoiler] ...and they were running a resteraunt in Paris for some reason. Not that [spoiler] Not only is this their only appearance in the whole game, you can't even interact with them or even see them in gameplay	[/spoiler] . And the others, well, their either completely ridiculous or just outright stupid, [spoiler] How would anyone breed a dingo to eat literally anything? How did the octopus or even the fox learn how to eat everything without even an explanation? How did the grey goo that, in the first two games, was created in a lab end up on Mars? And the worst part is that none of them even have a conclusion, not one final cutscene, even in the last stage	[/spoiler]. Not to mention, there are several stages you're supposed to avoid certain objects or lose points, like removing cynaide from some water molecules or infesting animals, but who cares? most of them seem to be to help people, but you're gonna be eating them in the next stage anyways, so why even help them? But anyways, about the Grey Goo section, the one that broke the camels back for me, which, unfortunatley is one huge spoiler, so for those who haven't played yet and still don't wanna be spoiled, it's nothing like the previous games finales  [spoiler] It started off promising enough, with the Goo at it's first stage, eating quarks and moving up as usual, before getting to the point where he could eat both Mars and the Earth (even if in the Bumblebee stage, you could eat Earth anyways, which leads to the conclusion none of these are in the same story but I digress) and it all goes good, going with the routes of eating the Milky Way, galaxies and even, for a nice touch, the Flying Spaghetti Monster and it all leads up to...the exact same thing from the start. No joke, it's just the stage where you could only eat Quarks again. Same background, same objects with the same apperance, they even move in the exact same way. The only difference is know they were being called "Universes" instead of "Quarks", because that makes so much difference. Going from tearing the fabric of the universe apart and eating the turtles of time...to just eating them up like they were M&Ms which you just did in the start. And not even an ending comic to wrap it up, just credits. What a joke!	[/spoiler]   At the end of it all, if you wanna play a Tasty Planet game, go for any of the other three. If anything, both Tasty Planet 2 and Tasty Blue did just about everything better. Tasty Planet 2 giving you actual different enviroments that all feel distinctly different before [spoiler] That goofy, yet kinda epic ending with the Turtles of Time	[/spoiler] and Tasty Blue where there was an overarching story with the multiple playable characters and [spoiler] Ending not only taking out the other forms but even being able to chomp through the Earth, something none of the others even got close too	[/spoiler]  This game had nothing new or better to offer that the previous games did, plain and simple.
I like the core concept here, but I have only been able to play the first few levels as there are no graphics options to either change the resolution it runs at or to force it to run in a window. My native res is 2560x1600 but the game seems to open in a smaller window (1920 x1080?) which then expands to full screen... but cuts off the sides in the process so I cannot see the full playing field and therefore cannot see platforms right on either edge. I have tried several common ways of addressing this (Alt + Enter), adding '-w' / '-window' / '-windowmode' to the end of custom shortcuts to the executable, but nothing seems to work. If the Dev reads this, please at the very least add a full screen / window option and I will happily change this review to positive!  ----  After more fiddling, I did finally manage to force window mode by running with administrator privileges and then using 'Ctrl + F' at the menu screen... But in this day and age I really shouldn't have to be faffing around this much for what is such a simple option that the majority of games include by default!
Clunky interface, no hotkeys, at leat that the game tells you about, and it does not explain werry well the most important mechanic of all, the order you place the things inn is allso the order the main box has to move over them for them to take effect, and you have no way of changing the order of them after they are placed, other than removing one and replacing it. game could have been fun on mobile, but not on PC, if it is released on mobile too, or they plan to do that, I hope they add an option for changing the number on the order squares afterthe fact.  oh, and one more thing, if you fail, you have to put out all the order-squares again, because they get removed.
Unplayable trash on default english it installs empty, after switch to russian it installs, but after menu and intro, player ends up falling thru the landscape, therefore there is pretty much no way to play it
Exceptionally annoying. Noisy. Poorly made. Don't bother.  https://youtu.be/8CfhrbUxDrY
Despite being a puzzle game and not having said that in the description, tags, or anywhere else on the store page (at the time of purchase and at the time of writing this review), I want to like this game.  The graphics are phenomenal, transitions between first and 3rd person are seamless, and the story seems entertaining…  But, as of right now the bugs are just too frustrating.  Trying to move while in first person up and down stairs and ramps, across bridges, or even across the threshold of stairs causes you to get stuck or slowly slide off the map.  The game needs to incorporate alternative styles of movement.  Aiming and collision detection seem way off as well (especially in the dragon level).  The sound clips are very poor quality too.  I'm not talking about the English narration (although it could do with a bit more believability), it's the walking sound clips, some of the action clips, and various others that just do not leave the best quality of sound in your ear holes.  Also, it's really annoying to have to suffer through the intro to the map if you fail, like on the dragon level, every single time.  Please update to only play the intro the first time and then start the game right after if restarting the level.  And there are no settings in game.  No sound, no graphics, no controls, absolutely no settings of any type.  Every game needs the ability to adjust game settings, it's just fundamental, typically covered in one of the first classes of game building 101.  So, in short, I want to like this game, but despite being as visually appealing as it is, it's just not there yet.
its a game that once again has been polished up like a sketchy car dealer. but on a real note i guess you get what you pay for. so yh up to you but its trash.
Trash not a game. Low fps on decent videocard, no content to make this asset compilation any interesting to play. Have many copies of this game on same publisher without any difference in game content.
why does my screen just go red after the loading screen
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED PLS DONT BUY THIS
really laggy and needs to add more to build.
i dont understand the reveiws on here my laptop is normaly decent for these kind of games but it runs like utter dog shit even on toast machine 
nOT SO MUCH FUNNY
Game is in an awful state, the multiplayer doesn't work and the bloom on the game will kill your graphics card. negativebloom/10
Just a boring cover of mirrors. Artwork is ok, gameplay not so much. Way too short.
Just beat the game in a little over 2 hours, in its current form (27th of Oct, 2018). It's a little short and the match three format is rather simple but it works okay. The game's not too hard and it was rather easy to beat. There's no hentai, just nudity.  I will re-review this when the full version is out.  EDIT: full game still not out in May 25th 2019. Can't recommend.
I think I bought the wrong Forest
Aside from being based on a frustrating puzzle game (called Fifteen, if I understand correctly), the animations are painfully slow, with absolutely no way to speed them up.
Why does this thing eat like 85% of my GPU nvidia geforce 1050 btw
this game made me hate both hentai and puzzles at the same time gg 2.76/10
Nice artwork and atmosphere but you never get to experience the artwork in it's full glory. There is no CG gallery, and you only ever see the image cut up into tiles or partially obscured by foliage (as you can see in the games screen shots). If they added a CG gallery I would change the review to positive. As it stands I will ask for a refund.
No story, nothing to do, hp down to 1 magically. No interest
Girl with a big SWORD is one of a kind game, as the main character your duty is to solve the problems of a tormented town by accepting and fulfilling the requests of many of the unique and memorable NPCs in town.  Pros: - NPCs won't repeat their dialogues and some may even disappear forever after talking to them, which makes a challenge to your memory abilities - Upon entering homes you'll be facing an enemy while you're at 1 HP, to prove your survival skills - World maps have at most one other area to explore, once you find it after going around it for like 30 minutes you'll feel a sense of accomplishment - Some texts are written in broken English and even some others remain untranslated to give out that natural foreign world language experience - Despite the title stating that the girl has a big SWORD she starts out with none, being this a metaphor that the sword was the adventures we lived through the game.  Cons: - Needs more bare naked tiddy
this games is too hard and too many glitches every time  you walk in a house your attacked and every time you talk to someone they disappear also you cant get the axe in the chest in the begining  please fix all this soon and difficulty of the game so it can be more enjoyable.
I just wanted to know it this game is really that bad as it states in the user reviews.  Yes, it is. 
This game is absolutely not playable. You start with one health every single encounter. Half the game is in broken english and the other half is in russian. Great sprite models but terrible dialogue.
This game is beyond broke. Ive had it for a year and nobody has fixed any of the problems. Thank god i only paid .99 for this game. Either fix this game or i will have steam remove this broken game that you claim to have fixed -_-. The problems Helath potions dont heal you mana potions dont do anything Russian text NPC's disapear Some buildings cause the game to crash 
game is broken other wise it looks nice and i would love to play it if it was working
so this game needs WORK! massive mess up on the laguage translations (suggest finding someone who is fluent in english and russian to translate). i understand the context of how she got there, being injured and needing to go to a nearby town, but restting health to 1 every time you leave or enter a house or go from one zone to the next is insane. character creation screen is locked so that you cant change the name, plus its in, idk what language. not too much to do in the main town, few little find this item type quests, but thats it. no clear objecctive to the game. also, upon leaving town, there is no monsters of any kind nor is there any other villages aside from a single cave where you get a specific item. the boats are a really neat touch, the music aint bad, and its  movement system is ALMOST fluid enough to be decent. this game has a good bit of potential. put some work in it and i KNOW you guys can turn it into to something great! im goin to check back in on it in about a month or so and see how you guys have progressed. im hoping yall improve it some! i really want to be able to recommend this game to my friends! its got a really nostalgic feel to it. so it needs work but i know you guys can make something that we would all want to come back to!
Dialog text is in Russian. No indication of what you are supposed to do.   Quote: The developers describe the content like this:  "Main character kill enemies."  Terrible translations. No explanation of options (or anything else). Total waste of time.
I wish I had read the reviews before paying for this. It's $2 more than it's worth and it only costs $1.19. It was not made in English, which is fine, but it is not properly translated to English afterward. The game is not complete. Many glitches occur within the first seconds of the game. Treasure chests and people disappear. There is an unending loop in the building on the right where you kill the orc and immediately start another fight. You can't get past it.
After playing the game for a few mins. I closed it and told myself WTF. Anyways I think the game is not completed yet and I think there are bugs like you go inside the house and you find yourself in the worldmap or fighting a monster with your character that has "1" hp, and some NPC's Disappear after talking to them. Some words are not translated to english, like speaking to the inn girl if it really was an inn, and the green chest conversation. There is no tutorial or clear objective on what to do in the game. you get no starting money and weapon. You get an Axe from the silver chest (lol) for choppping small trees. (Not for fighting monsters.)   Expectaion in the future update: Tutorial (If its a unique kind of RPG. cuz I dont see often in RPG that you go inside a house then find yourself in the world map lol) Please fix the bugs developers. I would like some "QUEST" category in the options. If the Character really has "1" hp make a short intro/story/explanation why the character has "1" hp. Im looking forward to this game.
Starting the game on a windows-machine had been difficult, because at first the antivirus-software fund FileRepMalware in the game.exe After starting the game you could chose your Charakter. That's simple, but okay. You get into a town, but you start with 1/400 HP and no coins. Which make it quiet difficult to fight. Even if you can heal yourself with a magic spell (in case you chose the woman). When you return from fight to the "traveling world" your Healthpoints get set back to 1/400.  The same problem is on al Linux machine. Another unplausible behaviour are the NPC's, you could talk to them once and then they disappear immediatly.  There need to be an update, so the game is playable!!!
Game doesn't see the controllers on characters selection screen. I can only proceed by pressing Enter on a keyboard, but then chars doesn't move neither with controllers nor with keyboard. Keys rebind doesn't work as well. Tried various setups of two xbox and steam controllers and a keyboard. No extra controllers related software installed. Refund goes in 3.. 2.. 1..
I was excited to play this game until I found that there is no vsync option.  It completely ruins the experience.
This game had so much promise, but it just doesn't cut it. From the screenshots you would think it is an awesome Warcraft 2 clone, but while that's what it aims to be, it misses the mark. My expectations were pretty low to begin with, I wasn't expecting much -- but this game did too many "bad things" in a short period of time. I played the game for roughly 40 minutes and in that time I encountered the following: Voice acting that interrupted itself several times (a new spoken sentence would start before one was finished), enemies in the starting area were able to perform ranged attacks through walls, the hero character disappeared and reappeared on the other side of an enemy in the middle of combat -- all of that combined with the fact you can't change the controls lead me to request a refund. I appreciate the passion that looks like went into making this game, but the execution is way off. Spend your money elsewhere.
The game is so bad it's hard to even know which issues to write about. The bugs are numerous and annoying, the game-play "upgrades" from Warcraft 3 are horrendous and the price this is being sold for is just outrageous. I have no idea how they managed to fake the 90% "Very positive" score but the only reason one should consider buying this is a case study on bad game design. It is truly amazing how badly they messed up the game while making so few changes to the copied source material.
I would recommend the game if i could at least do the first mission. Crash on loading, crashed on loading again, then i got destroyed by an backdoor attack of mage and a frontone of ballista. couldn't beat warden. reload and prevent the backdoor. but the warden bugged out, cutscene did not trigger. try to salavge my run with a quick save and quick load.. the fight trigger ! but since the event did not i cannot complete the stage.  not gonna try the first level of the campain again. im asking for a refund, wait till the issues is fixed to buy the game...if you are interessed.
First of all - I love WC2 and he's got everything right - nice units, art style, music, voice acting and gameplay with solid impact when every hit of every unit you feel because of good sound design and animation. Yes, setting of WC2 is cliche, but with his cartoony aesthetic it's not a problem.  What have Loria from this list of GOOD RTS? Nothing. Zero. Big black hole.  A game with absolutely zero personality, cringe voice acting, uninteresting story and boring gameplay.  Loria looks and feels like trashy and cheap WC2 clones from mid 90's - a games made for cash grabbing. Games like blindly copy basic formulas of new popular game to take a slice of pie.  Cheapness of artstyle (or even lack of artstyle) is noticeable even looking at screenshots and trailers, but I was hoping for good gameplay. And it somehow worse than WC2. Oh boy.  And I mention multiplayer?  What a good idea to copy cult classic with nice multiplayer and make your game WITHOUT multiplayer, right?  Better try to play Wyrmsun. It's WAY better.
Fair warning: I've never written a review before.  Phew - no.   First and foremost: I love RTS games, I earned my money playing them and creating content for them, I enjoy to play them and I love grand fantasy stories which is why I always take it with a grain of salt that most of the better RTS of recent years have been in sci-fi/modern era settings.   The trailer for Loria came along and I was interested - the graphics weren't necessarily what I would have liked but the whole thing was charming enough.  I bought it with the launch discount, which gave it a very fair price and just finished the campaigns while travelling with my old-ish laptop.  [u]Gameplay[/u] The [b]basic mechanics[/b] work alright, you can select up to 24 units, there's attack move, you can tab through your units. The devil's in the detail:   The [b]pathfinding[/b] is alright as long as there aren't any ramps, rivers, trees, fences, fairies or pebbles in the way. Especially on later campaign maps your units just tend to run around aimlessly, get stuck on the ramp, inside of each other (not as exciting as it sounds) and seem to be unable to move.   That you can [b]tab through your units[/b] is awesome and something I'm very used to. What I'm not used to is that units like Knights, that have no active abilities, are in the second slot while spellcasters like Clerics are in one of the last slots. Other games do this very intuitively where the spellcasters are at the front.  The [b]hotkeys for your heroes[/b] as F1 and F2 is traditional. What isn't traditional is that your hero doesn't get selected for immediate use when he's in your current control group. (i.E.: you have your whole army with 10 units and two heroes selected. You hit F2, the camera centers on your second hero but you can't use his abilities because the focus window is still on your first hero).   The [b]hotkeys in general[/b] annoy me as well - I don't want to hit P for Peasant, I want to hit Q for the icon in the upper left corner. I understand that this might be not as important for many players, but I thought I note it (and the fact that you can't seem to customize your hotkeys either).  That your units [b]promote[/b] with enough XP to deal more damage and be sturdier is a good thing, but as soon as they promote they also heal back to full which, coming back to air units, makes for tons of hilarious situations where you can raid the enemies workers to heal your units back to full. It also makes for weird and powerful swings when a hero dies since that often triggers plenty of level-ups for the units that were around for the kill, healing them back up to full in the middle of the fight.  The [b]AI[/b] is servicable for the most part, it rebuilds what you destroy (mostly exactly where you destroyed it, often while you're still there) and doesn't seem to cheat as far as I could tell, so that's a plus. It does, however, fall apart completely against air. With the mixture of pathing issues for it's units and the fact that it often trickles in units as soon as you're in range and pulling in units like catapults to defend you can trivialize most content as soon as you get some flying units on the field.  Finally there are some minor annoyances like why isn't there a display for how many workers are in a goldmine, why do I get an audio cue "Research complete" but can't see what it is, units stopping their current attack when you give another attack-move, air units awkwardly teleporting a few meters every now and again and so on and so forth.  But overall: still servicable, enough to let me enjoy a decent story but it feels like a chore to play. If this had multiplayer then I would have a hard time to bring myself to wrestle with mechanics that cumbersome game in and game out.  [u]The campaign[/u]  Oh boy. You decide to stay away from multiplayer: understandable, you're up front about it, why not.   The campaign starts out decent enough: the intro video is great, giving the main protagonist a bit of a funny / macho vibe works well enough and the first missions are interesting enough with a bit of banter, some units straight out of Warcraft and so on.   But the whole thing quickly gets a little disjointed: practically every mission ends with you destroying the last building/killing the last unit, cut to black, campaign map.   Warcraft 2/3, which this game has taken 85% of it's everything from anyway, does this much better: there are some final words from the heroes, the overall story gets moved forward with some text on a scroll that gets read to you, it manages to inspire a sense of greatness and the fact that you ARE shaping a fantasy world, that this game ... has a hard time achieving. The dialogue is almost nonexistant after the third mission, even after the first one it gets very sporadic.  For example (mild spoilers):   the 7th mission of the human campaign has you fighting an epic battle against several enemy bases. You destroy the last building, the score board pops up, you go back to the campaign screen where the next and final mission is selected. It has a one-liner as a description, you hit play and you land on the map with the objective "Destroy the red base" in the upper left corner. That's it. That's all the suspense you get for the final confrontation of the game.  Or someone agrees to help you, your ally is uncertain if they can be trusted, 2.5 seconds later they prove their trust - any further comments? No. Some knights come charging in, old friends of the protagonist showing up to hunt him down. You defeat them. Any words on that? Nah, you slaughter old friends wordlessly and just carry on.  You come back to defend the capital, you charge in to help out the rallying defenders of the city. Any comment on that? Nah.   There are several months of war waging between your faction and the enemy faction. How is that explained in game? A single sentence. A SINGLE sentence.   The game shows that it had great voice actors and a decent idea to get a unique story off the ground. The game even shows you in the first two missions that it's able to react to certain situations with some hero chatter, to spawn units and so on - it just got abandoned after a small taste of the whole thing.  [u]Final thoughts[/u]  The decision to skip multiplayer should have led to a tight single player campaign. Sadly that isn't done with slapping together 8/16 maps, adding 10 lines in the first two missions and then just make me kill base after base whose most notable increase in difficulty is the fact that my army is almost incapable of traversing any ramp.   Some minor thing like skirmish only on 5 maps, the cumbersome control issues mentioned earlier and smaller annoyances just pile up to make me not that interested in the game.   Overall I can't recommend this game but I have high hopes for the developer. I always appreciate a newcomer to the genre, the basic ideas were great (even if scavenged from certain other games) and I think that they'll achieve good things if they can get someone on-board that keeps the campaign engaging throughout.  And most importantly: those guys managed to finish a game and put it out there, something that is commendable in itself.
I don't normally review games but here goes. Just to give a bit of background to my experience with the genre one of my first games ever and my first RTS experience ever was Warcraft 2, i replayed through the campaigns at least a dozen times and i'v also put who knows how many hours into Warcraft 3(and Starcraft and Starcraft 2) plus a ton of C&C. So with that said i'm probably at least to some degree the target audience for this game.   The game is a pretty interesting mix of Warcraft 2's more straightforward RTS mechanics and limited roster with some Warcraft 3 elements like auto-casting on certain spells, actual hero characters(with levels, abilities and items you can pick up) and mob camps on the map defending gold mines or usable to level your hero. The gameplay loop is pretty basic, considering at it's core it's a Warcraft 2 clone, and revolves around gathering gold and wood and putting out units as quickly as possible to overwhelm your enemy. The AI is pretty competent, at least on hard tho i doubt it will provide much of a challange for people well aquainted with the genre.  The game's art style is nice and the overall unit design is pretty good for an indie title like this. The unit sounds are also pretty good and the voice acting is about what you'd expect from an indie title. The campaign is pretty derpy and didn't really keep me interested beyond the first 4 missions.  Now to the negatives. The biggest problem with the game is that it has no multiplayer. Yes, i'v seen people saying that if the game sells well enough the devs said they'd implement it but i don't think a game is this genre can atract a proper playerbase to beign with when it launches without arguably it's most important feature. It also doesn't help matters that the game's campaign is pretty short, 16 missions in total, and at least for me was pretty uninteresting. Once you're done with thoset you only have 5 maps to fight the AI on.   I wish yet again these reviews had a neutral option. I just don't feel there's enough content there for the asking price and i think the devs sort of shot themselves in the foot by not releasing the game with at least some manner of multiplayer. I think that both for veterans of the genre and newcomers the game will sadly become stale pretty quickly. While it pains me to do this, considering how few titles come out in the genre these days i just can't recommend the game in it's current state. If they put more work into it and it eventually gets multiplayer and more content i'd be more than happy to revisit this review and change it to a positive one.
A bunch of questions multiply by zero. I mean... welp.
With a catchy title like [i]Hentai 2+2=4[/i] I knew I was in for some highbrow entertainment right from the start!  For the morbidly curious, [i]Hentai 2+2=4[/i] is a colorful click-fest that has players answering multiple-choice math questions in order to incrementally reveal segments of a low-quality image depicting an anime girl's breasts or panties. No faces or full bodies here -- it's boobies or panties only. If this sounds like a fun time to you, then take a moment to congratulate yourself on likely being part of one of the smallest human minorities in all of history.  I actually find the author's absolute refusal to show anything other than breasts or panties somewhat fascinating. It seems less like a fetish and more like he is attempting to conceal from where he culled these images. Without an easily recognizable face attached to the body parts in question, it would be harder to accuse him of copyright theft or plagiarism. While I don't want to out-and-out accuse this developer of stealing the art (I simply don't know either way), the rest of the game is so obviously rushed and by-the-numbers that I can't imagine any original artwork was produced just for this game.  I cannot recommend this game to anybody, even as a joke, except for those who want to earn a quick set of achievements.  You don't even have to care about doing the math correctly. Just click the selectable answers until you end up with the right one. They are the same problems in the same order every single time, and you are not really penalized for clicking the wrong answers, you just have to retry that particular equation and select different options until you find the one which is "correct". I used the word "correct" in quotes because at a glance, it appeared that in at least a couple instances the correct answer [i]wasn't actually[/i] the correct answer, but I'm not going to waste my time booting the game back up and verifying that.  Chalk this one up to another gem in my ever-growing collection of gloriously, shamelessly terrible games that I'll never play ever again. The music is kinda good, though.
Ez 100% achievement game, orite nice. Then i found out 2 saddest things: 1. 0 is not same as 000 (ok, i mean the dev trolls player, ok i got that) 2. The dev skipped his primary school not knowing the bodmas problems and went straight to be a game dev.  *Maybe he was learning how to watch pornhub without being caught by parents.
[h1] Achievement Spam Garbage. Do Not Buy! [/h1]  You can beat this game in less than 5 min. Game only has 10 achievements. I've also had this game crash on me 4 times! It was also glitched where I could not progress, but the dev has fixed that... However it required me to delete the game and redownload for the patch to even install (that might have just been Steam being dumb.)  As you would guess, this is just one more to the pile of trash flooding Steam, do not support it!  [h1] Death to all achievement spam garbage! [/h1]
A well-implemented game in technical terms, there is a gallery. Mathematics 2-3 classes. The quality and interest of the pictures on 3 points out of 5. Little content. Fast passage in 10 minutes. Then there will be one math and the pictures will be repeated. Add content! For that kind of money, you could put 100 pictures in there, even more, given that you can watch pictures for free in internet. well, you know!  Well, you know how it works! Torrents are alive. You have to do very good games!  For $ 0.5, we get ... We get nothing!  Just lack of talent! No normal creativity! Kill yourself against the wall with this piece of shit you call a game!!! Bastards!
What a fucking waste of time and money. Just don't.
I understand the physics are different than the traditional tables but this is ridiculous for a casual player.
I don't really want to give this a thumbs down, but Steam only gives you 2 choices.  If there there was a way to give a "meh" vote, that is what this would be.  I don't really feel comfortable giving it a thumbs up when I have such a big problem with the WIlliams DLC.  I have always liked virtual pinball games and while this is the first time I have played Pinball FX3, I used to have Zen Pinball 2 on my Playstation 3.  I really liked Zen Pinball 2 and I have to say that the free table that comes with Pinball FX3, Sorcerer's Lair, is really fun.  But, the fun experience has to do with the fact that these are "virtual" games.  They have no basis in the real world so I have no expectations of them trying to simulate a real world experience.  Long ago I fell in love with Pinball Arcade, and more recently with Zaccaria Pinball, because these games were able to provide a realistic recreation of the pinball experience from my younger years.  I am in my 40s.  I could be the oldest person on Steam.  I have been playing pinball since I was able to stand on a milk crate at the local skating rink and pump quarters that my Dad gave me into tables like Black Knight and Big Shot.  To be able to play these same games on my Playstation and then later on Steam was amazing.  To have the game play, even though virtual, be so similar to a real pinball table was something that made me happy to live in the digital age.  Up until my Playstation 3 died, I was playing all the Williams tables available on Pinball Arcade, and I was in the process of buying all of the tables again on Steam for my PC, when Williams sold the license to Zen.  I had most the WIlliams tables on Pinball Arcade on Steam, but there were several that I was missing.  When I realized that Pinball FX3 had introduced their first WIlliams pack and it had 3 tables I did not have on Pinball Arcade (Junkyard, FIsh Tales, The Getaway: High Speed II) I was really happy that I would be able to install Pinball FX3 and still play these tabless on my PC .  Unfortunately though, they are a bit disappointing.  The first reason is that they censored the artwork.  These games were originally made for a very broad audience which included kids.  Arcades in the 80s and 90's were full of children.  It's not like these tables were Porky's The Pinball Game.  Are kids now days so fragile that they can't see a girl in a bikini?   Except for the blood on the swords, in Midevil Madness, there is nothing in the artwork for any of these games that a kid would not see on a trip to the beach.  Are we as a society going to ban children from the beach because seeing someone in a bathing suit, or smoking, or with a beer in their hand will warp their development?  If not, why do we have to censor games that they probably are not even going to play.  The censorship sucks, but it is really just an annoyance compared to the most dissappointing aspect of these recreations.  The gameplay is not even remotely like a real pinball game.  Games like Zaccaria and Pinball Arcade have the physics down.  The ball behaves the way a real pinball would behave.  On Pinball FX the ball behaves the same way it does on their virtual tables.  This was never a dissappointment to me when I was playing a table that was an original virtual pinball creation and not based on a real table, but on the Williams tables it is a total let down.  At times, the ball seems like it has no real weight.  Other times, it seems like it is powered by a rocket engine.  I was playing The Getaway and I hit the ball up into the raceway in the upper deck and it sped around and around endlessly at high speed like the powers of physics did not apply.  On Midevil Madness, if the ball gets even close to the castle door it seems to shoot right in.  I guess what I am saying is that while I would like to give this DLC a thumbs up, because I love these tables, I really can't until Zen does something about the fact that the physics engine for their virtual games does not really translate into a great experience for simulations of real pinball tables.  They should seriously think about adding an option to play these games with "real world physics".  If they do that I would give this an enthusiastic thumbs up despite the lame censorship for all these delicate children of the modern age.
The graphics and sound on these tables are very nice and a big step up from Pinball Arcade and the various Visual Pinball recreations that seem to fall short to varying degrees.  I have owned two different Medieval Madness machines and the physics here is ok but still feels a bit "off". It seems like Zen has spent some time tweaking the flipper physics and that part is pretty good -- getting control of the ball and passing between flippers works as I would expect (might even be a bit too easy). But when the ball is traveling around the playfield, I can only describe it as feeling like it has too little weight and it just gets way too much speed in many circumstances. Even the ball exiting the wireforms doesn't feel quite right (maybe it drops too soon?) I'm hopeful that Zen can make some progress in tweaking the physics to get it from "good" to "great".  As for the whole censorship thing - I understand folks being upset about the censoring of original artwork elements. I also understand Zen feeling compelled  to alter things to achieve a certain rating. The company just needs to be up front about it. Calling these "arcade perfect simulations" that can be played "in their original form" is inaccurate. If you're making changes to the original game, at least be up front about it so people can make an informed purchasing decision. The changes don't bother me a ton - the misleading marketing does. It's hard to support this title with a recommendation until Zen provides full disclosure that the customer is receiving slighty altered versions of these games to make them more child-friendly.
The tables play and look quite nice. I was pleasantly surprised by Zen's first outing in recreating iconic tables. So why the negative review?  They're not true to form to be honest, right? Not when the tables are censored. If you take out original artwork that was on the actual table, it is NOT the 'original, classic, true-to-form' interpretation that you claim it to be.  And I had to read about the censorship on the discussions here, not here  on the store page where you sell it.  Very bad form, Zen... I'm not going to refund it at this time, but this WILL be the last pack I buy on all platforms (PC, Switch, PS4) if you keep censoring original tables.  I have always enjoyed Zen's original offerings, but if this is how you're going to treat original pinball artwork, I'm going to think twice about buying future tables on these and other platforms.
This should've been a positive review with a thumbs up but it sadly won't be.   Yes, those tables are classics. Medieval Madness is one of the absolute all-time classics.  Yes, the graphics are flashy and nice. Yes, the tables look really good. Yes, even the background looks good. Yes, the sound is good. Yes, i guess the physics are all right and you can play the tables either in their original form or in the FX version with added effects (though some, like the castle exploding look rather silly and cheap) altough the advertised as realistic new physic engine is weird, the ball seems to be made out of rubber and for example in tourney mode on Medieval Madness it feels as if the castle gate has a vaccuum cleaner behind it that sucks the ball in.   But the fucking censorship was never needed.  I don't even get it. Who is the target audience of digital Pinball? It's safe to asume that the vast majority of Pinball FX3 players is above 18 years old. Yet apparently Zen thinks we're all small children, who have to be kept safe from Innuendo, jokes, the depiction of cigars (as we all know, you see a cigar and you instantly turn into a chain smoker...) and even toilet sound effects. Do kids even play Pinball? I'm pretty sure they're too busy killing each other in Fortnite anyway, they would never touch this. So why do this to us adults?  This is just beyond pathetic and it makes me shudder to think what those idiots would do to tables like Bride of Pinbot or Xenon or Creature from the Black Lagoon....they probably gonna put the poor Creature in a dress...  I'm glad i have those tables on Pinball Arcade in their uncensored, original glory, the way they were meant to be played.   Also there are a bunch of really annoying bugs like the game rom pitching up and down in sound on all tables, Fish Tales has a massive hole in the inlane and even some graphic blunders like the inverted W logon on the flippers in High Speed (how does something like that happen?)  Don't buy this. Don't support them and their censorship.
Game says it has multiplayer but there is only local multiplayer and the game is boring.
bad game
good game but too many bugs: - 21:9? NOPE - "F" stopped work - dont click two times or more at skip day, now its endless night without monsters - can't save game options, every time i click play i have to configure settings - you can build flying building + can't use them - automine is like my cat: sometimes it work sometimes not - stacked potions, can't use one specific
You'll get your money's worth of playtime but overall the game feels unbalanced. The accuracy mechanics of your range units is frustrating and melee units are easily overwhelmed. You'll handle every wave fine and then suddenly your people just fall apart with little you can do.  I like how they have the mines you can explore and a town to build between waves of enemies, that's cool. But overall I think your limited time on earth is better spent with a better example of the tower defense/base building genres, or maybe they'll flesh out the game's curve and allow more unit variety.
Ok, to be fair: This cost $3, $5 with the DLC. I can't get too mad at it. If you're okay with a LOT of clunkiness and frustration you could spend $3 in many worse ways.  HOWEVER!  Grim Nights is a annoying hurry-up-and-wait exercise, with minutes of twiddling your thumbs between every panicked scramble to save an idiot villager with no sense of self-preservation. Success seems to be HIGHLY dependent on RNG; you might get several +2 workers on day 1, or you might get nothing but "this guy's very slow! ha ha!" You may find plenty of treasure chests for potions you need to make your combat units effective past day 2, or you may not. You may receive villagers with a damage buff, or you may not. And all these dice rolls need to go in your favor for you to have a fighting chance.  Of course, even if the numbers work out your archers still need to be manually ordered to stop firing uselessly into enemy shields, every time. Your miners need to be manually ordered to RUN AWAY FROM ZOMBIES, every time. It's like playing Lemmings, if Lemmings occasionally rolled a d20 and you just lost the level if the roll was less than 15.  Every monster other than the base generic zombie is designed to add more micromanagement to the combat. Micromanagement has no sensible place in this game because picking individual units out of a crowd is... ugh!  You can tell from the screenshots that everything is tiny and fiddly, but what you can't tell from screens or video is how goddamn finicky the cursor is. Trying to click on a worker that's in motion is a pain in the ass; you have to draw a box around them. A fairly large box, too; a person-sized box won't select them. Grabbed multiple workers in your huge box? Start over. Want to interact with an item on the ground? Not if it's intersecting a ladder, bucko. And oh my god, the contextual way ladder and stairs work, ugh, trying regroup units on different floors is a nuisance.  But still, I mean, $3.  WHY ARE WORKERS ALLOWED TO HOLD TORCHES BUT MILITARY AREN'T? DON'T GIVE ME "uhhhh they have to hold their weapons", are my farm workers scything wheat one-handed? fuck off with that  Only $3 though
So yea, I looked forward to playing this game and after the last update I decided to give it another shot... Yet for some reason when this game starts up  it disconnects my second screen  and boots in a full white screen.   The screen only reconnects after a full windows reboot.  So this game as it is in unplayable for me at least.
Game's got potential, but lacks game balance. It feels like someone came up with a cool idea, and made most of the game, but then gave up at the end when it got hard. (Not saying that's what happened, just what the game quality feels like to me.)  It was cheep and I guess I got what I paid for; was fun for a bit but after one play through on beginner mode hitting the boss at night 11 I think I'm done already. #uninstalled.
WTF is the point of beginner mode if the first boss is 100x more difficult than anything faced before? The balance of this game is terrible.
It's just kind of boring waiting for the enemies to attack during the night time.   I wish there was a speed up and pause time settings, like in other games such as Rimworld (not the 'skip to undead wave' button -- something to make the zombies hurry up after the wave has already begun). It was actually so boring waiting for the zombies to attack the first night I uninstalled right then and there.  Also, graphically speaking, i know pixel is an aesthetic, but units are simply too hard to see. Maybe make them brighter colored, add outlines, make them glow, anything really. Both enemies and villagers blend too seamlessly into the background, giving everything a sort of muddled impression that isn't easy on the eyes.  Especially during night time, which is supposed to be the most 'exciting' part of the game, due to the contrast being too low (and the setting can't be adjusted...) it's very difficult to make out anything.   Having to micro units up and down ladders is also a pain.
Great game and concept; so-so execution. I truly wish there was a "neutral" review option. I love the game overall, but it is absolutly plagued by some late-game balance issues...  I've played on normal and hard, and I have to say, somewhere around day 10 things ramp up BIG TIME. I've made it to Grim multiple times, but without cheesing the boss encounters, the game is pretty much unbeatable.   You have to abuse the wall/building mechanics and just spam-build tons of garbage/dummy buildings. That doesn't feel "strategic" to me. I feel as though there should be another tier of units and/or additional defensive structures or buffs added. You simply don't have the tools you need to defeat some of the bosses (especially Grim) without abusing the mechanics...  Also, as an aside, all Melee units need HUGE buffs. I should not have a clump of max-potioned Knights get 1-2 shot from the later game mobs, that feels...wrong. Perhaps units could level up over time based on their kill counts?  Love the game overall, just hoping it gets a couple of much-needed patches! I'll be more than happy to update the review then!
Its crash a lot,, u need to quick save every 2min and if u forget to do it like 20min after, u re fucked
I was really enjoying this game until the 5th night boss came around and slaughtered everything.  Even on easy, this thing is ludicrously over powered, requiring tactics that seem like cheating in order to continue.  I can totally see this being great for a  higher difficulty level, but "easy"?  No.    In short, it's a wonderful little game that is ruined for me less than half-way through by its lack of balance.  I'll gladly revisit the game and change this review should a future update resolve this.  Regardless, if you are the kind of gamer who revels in difficult challenges that require a lot of micromanagement and trial and error to develop a winning strategy, try this game out.  It's well worth the price.
Everything was going great until day 5 on EASY. YES EASY. Then comes this Mergle and destroy everything. That creature is too tough and especially on EASY. Nope spoiled the whole game for me. I should be in time for a refund. I would suggest to anyone thinking of getting this. If you want to lose all and die only at day 5, then get this, I am not wasting my time just to lose everything at day 5 because the devs decided its fun to add an almost impossible monster on EASY. If i get refund then no problem but going to be pi$$d if i do not get refund. I did not pay money to be frustrated and no defense against a creature who kills everything in its path.
Haven't gotten "far" into the game and it doesn't really have much of a way to win beyond survive 13 days. Even so, I feel able to make some decent thoughts on the game, and even if it was less than 2 euro as I bought it I would not recommend it at that price.  The game has fairly little to it in my opinion that makes it worthwhile. It takes forever to get anywhere, everything is so small you can and will miss it, constantly. If it wasn't for the sake that you can press I to find any idle workers I would probably get nowhere, and workers really are a mess, they are all randomized, problem for me is that it is so obvious that some are better than others, some only have flaws others have good things about them, some are clearly choices for being archers, others for grinding a specific resource, but I really hate how random they are. They even have a portrait for some reason which is all pointless because the character is maybe 5 pixels on a screen.  The game forces you to micromanage everything and that if nothing else is a serious bother to me personally. You COULD tie a group of units to 1-0 buttons like a good quality of life sort of thing for any RTS, but there is often little reason as you will have such a varied amount of units, some will be too slow to follow the group and end up not really being useful. God forbid you try to tie a gang of workers to the same key, because you will still have to pick them individually and pick them to pick a specific resource spot, bloody heck forgive they might go to the closest of the same resources if available. As for the soldiers its worse, if you tie a group together which might act as a rapid response unit of sorts you betetr not have different unit types, because they will just bumble up together and the archers might be in the front and the healers may be in the middle of a melee.  You can set some things to wait and you can even leave most resource gathering going on their own for a long while, but the notices when something happens are so small, so fast that I just ignore it, because 90/100 times it was nothing important, and 9 out of the remaining 10 times it was just a new worker which obviously fits into role X and you wish you could just set up a system to put them to work rather than hav you do it all.  TL;DR - The game lacks good quality of life things that RTS games should have while having others which makes me really believe that the developer just doesn't have the time for everything. The game is 100% micromanagement, there is no way you can macromanage like I would prefer, nothing is macromanagable, you have to do everything except to pick up the resources like in mobile clicker games.  Might edit the review at a later date, this game kept me up for way too long and just left me angry and unfulfilled.
Very little to this game
Very similar to a little game called Kingdoms and fun for a few hours... then you meet Mergle, the first boss. Mergle wipes out your entire military force (he can destroy four archers in a level 3 tower in a single hit) and if you're lucky enough to kill it you're left with a population cut in half and a depleted military you have to replenish with garbage tier villagers that trickle in slower than molasses rolls uphill in January. By the end of the day, your military is back up to about half it's prior numbers, a quarter of it's prior strength (because the game gave you nothing but woodcutters, miners and people with a 20% movement debuff) and you're almost entirely out of wood and iron to recruit more. Sun goes down, zombies come out, you get steamrolled. Game over. And this is on easy mode, because the bosses are deliberately designed to destroy your population numbers and make you struggle to get back to where you were. On a high difficulty setting, fine, but when the 1st boss wipes your entire military of 25-30 tier 2 spearmen, healers and arbalists with massively OP AOE attacks and then trickles in garbage villagers to replace them with, on EASY mode? No, I'm calling BS on that.  There's a lot of RNG involved here, both in what type of new villagers you roll and resource placement on the map. The RNG is pretty poor for both. You might end up with a village full of miners and three or four that are useful for combat, or none at all. Farmers are nearly nonexistent, while villagers with a 20% movement debuff are as common as stink on shit. They're about as useful, too, at least until what's-his-face comes around looking for sacrifices. They have a use then and you'll very much enjoy sending them to their deaths. Regarding the resources, you may get resources everywhere or you might get no more than ten trees on the ENTIRE map, most of which will be way away from your base, and practically no iron and/or gold, basically making the map unplayable.  There's also way too much micromanagement going on and on the most basic and tedious levels. For example, you can mine into the ground but you have to direct your miners to go up and down ladders. You can't have a miner on the surface, pick him, and then rt click on a rock underground. Nope, you have to send him down the ladder into the mine, then down another ladder to where the rock is, then rt click the rock. Every. single. fakkin. time. And that's just for miners. You may need to send others down there, too, and it works the same way. This is no fun whatsoever when you have an extensive underground mine system and tons of people down there working. They're constantly depleting a resource node and need to be A. found amongst the other 30 or so miners and B. moved. This is on top of microing umpteen surface villagers.  Then there's just trying to select those villagers. THEY ARE TINY and very hard to click on, especially when moving or if you're in a hurry. Selecting groups moves them in tight packs, making it even harder to selct a single one later. It also makes potions rather silly. As far as I have seen, they only work on individual villagers. Try giving one to a single spearman or archer that's jammed up against several more. It's almost impossible. Potions should have an AOE effect on everybody in range and just do away with this headache.  Last but not least, the game simply looks dull. Nearly everything is either green or brown, in varying shades of drab. Why are there no flowerbeds in front of houses, at least tier 3 houses, or planter boxes? The tavern, too. There's nothing, unless you want to spend 5 gold to put sheep or chickens on the roof. That's right, on the roof of the house! I was really sort of stunned when I realized this and thought to myself "This just can't be. Surely, there's some color at higher village levels?!" so I checked the screenshots. I saw something that looked like green and red torches, and that's it.  Still, given it's price, it's hard to not recommend this game, and I'm sure the guy worked hard on it, but I'm going to not recommend it anyway. Why? Because, really, it's just not much fun and price is a nonfactor. Objective quality is not judged by it's cost but by well-designed and intuitive mechanics and overall fun factor, regardless of the cost. This game doesn't have it, not for $0.50 and not for $50.   I do see that a lot of people like it. That's fine. I probably like a lot of games they despise. That's just the way it goes. If you think the game looks fun and don't care about any of this, pick it up. Hell, it's just $3! I'm not going to recommend it, though, for the simple fact that I don't think it's a good game.
This game is.... Well I don't know tbh, between the frequent crashes on startup and when it does finally manage to load correctly me getting 10-15 fps (on a game where I should get 100+) I couldn't get any farther than half building some turrets and beginning to chop some trees. Needs optimised and debugged badly.
I saw this game on Youtube and was interested buying it and downloading it, once installed i ran it up only for the game to LOSE ITS SHIT, im talking about a mess of pixels with random mobs all glitched out with no options except to wait for pixels to slowly pop in and random scenes that are fuzzed out pop up i have no clue whats happening 
Sound design: 5/5 Graphics : 4/5 Gameplay : 2/5 Replayability: 2/5  Add this game to your wishlist and stand by, because there are two issues that need to be addressed in order for you to have a good time. Here's are the  issues with  and why I'm giving it a negative review (which I'll change as soon as they're addressed) :  1. Babysitting workers:    Workers can't navigate up and down the mine shafts, so you have to direct them manually. Late-game you have more than 30 workers in the mineshafts and workers go idle as soon as their resourse is depleted. You can't simply tell them to go to another resourse. You have to make them climb up or down a ladder and then order them to go to the resourse on that level ... workers go idle all the time, so imagine having to do this every 5-10 seconds late-game. DO NOT BUY until a path-finding system is implemented.  2. Micromanagement without tools :   When workers go idle you can't see them in a list or panel. You have to look around the landscape to find them or press I  to cycle through idle workers. Half the times pressing I switches to a worker that is already gathering resourses.  Unit selection is also abysmal - Units have tiny hitboxes and you can't select units when they're on the move. 90% of the times you'd use a square selection to grab them. Each worker has specific traits and you have to tell them what to do based on them. If you select two or more units, their traits are not listed, neither are their character icons so you can't pick an individual from a group of units .. they're just selected entities that you can order about as a collective (which  is ok for warriors, but one worker can gather one resourse) Shift  + Left Mouse doesn't work. You can't select multiple characters this way.  Once these problems are fixed the game will be worth your time.
No pause option
Was fun until day 2 when I got an enemy called Mogda. It said I should sacrifice units to him and I killed 10 with no effect. Then he exploded into 20 small units that raped my whole village.  Not cool.
I got this game on sale for $0.49. Since it was so cheap, I had low expectations. There's not a lot of content, but that's fine. The game is pretty simple, but that's fine. I would have written a positive review, except the game is broken. It's very common to set a path correctly, but the guy dies when he reaches the intersection, as though the path were set wrong. There's one mechanic in the game, and it doesn't work correctly. Not worth my money or my time.
I feel like there is too many new things that dont compliment the old stuff, but conflict. The new stuff is great, but somehow the overall experience isn't Civ 6 anymore.
Weather is mechanic that doesn't simply work too good - the impact on the game is small and it doesn't influence my decisions. Also the World Congress was much much better in Civ5.
Some of the things are neat, I love what they did with strategic resources, I'm glad they brought back the Wold Congress, and there's a bunch of new Wonders/Leaders. Some of the things are cool in theory but didn't get implemented too well - unless you're intentionally dragging it out, the game will end before you get access to the new 21st century techs and civics, Natural disasters either don't bother you at all or destroy half a city there's not much in between - and Sea Level is impossible to manage in cities founded mid/late-game, flood barriers just take too long to build. And then there's Rock Bands - where you can go the whole game without doing anything for Tourism, then win the game 30 turns after you get rocks bands with a culture victory.  They're considered Great People too, so they can't be killed even if you're at war, just sent home.  I wish they had broken it up into several upgrade packs instead of billing it as a full expansion, even if the overall price was the same,  so I could enable what I want and ignore the rest.   Overall it's mediocre, definitely not worth the full sticker price but maybe with a good sale.
It adds a lot of clutter to the already busy map. Another case of "looks good on paper" / "boring ingame".
I bought this just to find out if volcanic eruptions contribute to C02 levels.....  They don't.
No.
how to ruin a great franchise ... the climatehoax in your game...spacerobots... no fixes for diplomacy religion or the broken spawnlocations.... worthless congress  this game has cost me about 150euros... please do better
I've tried playing this game a few times and bought the updates, hoping the game would get better, but I just can't get into it. I don't like look of the map and I find many of the changes from Civilization V irritating. Some of the automated moves in Civ V have been dropped making this game more of a chore.
I've played all the Civilization games since the very first one 30 odd years ago. I got Civ 6 as part of the Humble Bundle last year and played it a little and found it was lacking in a lot of areas. Still, I enjoyed it somewhat. So a couple of days ago, I saw that most of the Civ 6 stuff was on sale. Unfortunately this was not. The reviews were mixed and I debated on whether to spend $40 on Gathering Storm and decided to just bite the bullet and do it. After playing with it for a while... I've come to the conclusion that "expansion" is just a money grab. It might be worth $15 or $20 but there in no way it approaches $40 in value.   What do you get for your $40? A few little natural disaster animations... the natural disasters don't really do a whole heck of a lot. I had a city adjacent to a volcano that had the largest eruption in the game and lost 1 population and damaged some tiles. It took about 5 turns to fix it all.   There are some other odds and ends you get but... the AI is still horrid. Again, this isn't worth $40 and while it may make the base game a little better, it doesn't fix the fundamental flaws with the game. Take your $40, buy something else. Come back to this DLC when it's under $20.
take my money 2k you greedy whore
All Civ Mac products seem to be plagued with performance issues of late and the full version is no exception. The game hangs, ignores commands for units and is generally as unplayable as the iOS version. I should have checked the mixed reviews more before spending my money on an unplayable game.
Still not balanced Rock bands are a joke, especially indie rock bands.
DO NOT BUY  $40 for 2 "new" (not really) mechanics,  broken AI, and nothing intuitive. Save your  money and go to the bar instead, thats a funner way to get aids
Bought this out of impulse to play Civ again but with the bonus new Civs and game mechanics. Not worth the 53$ (CAD) price tag, buy for 20 -30.  The added Global Warming, Environmental hazards and Diplomatic changes were cool and changed how I played the late game. However for what you get, its not worth its current price.
One of the worst expansions ever created by the company. The enemies and diplomacy are an utter joke of what it should be.  I played settler to get a grip of gameplay and within 3 TURNS am at war with 2 civilizations...how is this even a thing! I then defend myself and am refused peace by my enemies and am punished by the world diplomacy for being a warmonger when I have barely anything. This happens all the time btw. There is no way to turn off or select aspects you actually like either and now I am out 40 bucks I would have rather spent on something better.  If you want to add to Civ 6 ignore this at all costs. The only things done well are the additions of civilizations and the climate aspect.  If any developers Civ are reading this just know unless I can activate or deactivate the game changing additions so i can stop having awful features just overshadow and eliminate any good will towards the expansion, just dont it would have been fun but now Im questioning ever buying your products ever again.
MP and Internet games are broken after latest update on LINUX ;( !!!!
game crashed please help
FIX THE FUKING BUG U DUMB AS
Would not recommend at the current price.  Major addition here is climate change mechanics.  It doesn't add enough content to justify $40 on the game.  Overall, i do think it adds quality to the game though.  Wait for this one on at least 50% sale.  PS.  This has been the least amount of time i played a DLC for any Civilization game.  Need more content for the cost.
Again, the core problems of Civ 6 still remain: as AI is still awful and broken, even with another attempt by Firaxis to expand the game.  They need to fix the AI.  It is no longer acceptable.  Not to mention DLC is way too expensive for what you actually get.  The Global Warming mechanics feel way more like a pointless gimmick, almost completely counterable, and ends up feeling more of a political reason to add it into the game rather than something that truly improves the game.  "Disasters" are almost all beneficial, as the damage they do is far less than the bonuses that come after, you start to cheer when that volcano becomes active and wipes out a good chunk of population.  Congress is annoying and not really engaging.  The bonuses are nonsensical and takes way too long to deal with for what you get out of it.  But really these things are just minor complaints at this point.  Ultimately, Civ 6 could easily be the best Civ if it wasn't for the flat out dysfunctional AI.  It takes a lot of time to learn all the details to min/max and build your civ and create economies, they get all that stuff totally right, hence the many hours of playtime (the 0.0 hours played above is a bug or because its an expansion its not counting the hours?  I got 400+ hours in civ 6), but once you figure all that out and try to learn diplomacy dynamics, the AI starts to really show its true form.  As in, complete garbage, and the entire experience falls flat completely.    I was neutral and wanted this game to succeed because I've played a lot of Civ in my lifetime, but I don't have much confidence in Civ 6 or firaxis anymore.
This update is pretty good. But there is a bug, which needs to be fixed first, which is the loss of wonder. If you start building wonders, suddenly the game stops building it when half finished and the wonder simply disappears. So, you end up having wasted time to build other things and the wonders are gone. Once the bugs are gone, this upgread is going to make the game much better.
Amazing DLC but that price is ridiculous!
I found this DLC have some bug. AI are totally stupid, who are willing to pay much $ to exchange military resource. Easy to earn over $10000 money...
Looks nice, but the AI just ruins it, Like playing checkers vs yourself.
too fucking expensive but good dlc it worth like 15-20 bucks
40€ for new content that I can't try because still no UI scaling for ultrawide in 2019.  Its like no toilet paper in the restroom at a 5 star hotel. Wait for a good discount sale. You can`t change the grayed out UI scaling, but can fix the problem by changing 20+ lines of text in the install folder. For the price tag of CIV VI, it should work. Requesting a refund. And it is mi first ever and I  own 300+ games where a lot of them don't support scaling and this is the first game that really ***********.
形同虚设的云端游戏和联机功能，垃圾到令人发指的服务器。 Most terrible server I have ever seen.
A fine bunch of handy and interesting features that add a sprinkle of flavour to the game.  Not worth the price tag. ($54.95 AUD)  Seems like an overpriced attempt to bring awareness to climate change - and YOU pay for the ticket to attend that boring lecture.  If you're still a big fan of the game, by all means, all power to you.
AVOID  Base game is made considerably worse by this update.  The climate change is handled VERY badly.  It adds little else, certainly nothing worth the cost.  But my recommendation against is not based on price as I would down vote it were it free.    It adds some bug fixes but by and large there were mods that did this better.  The warmonger change is slightly better but still broken.  For example:  peace loving Sweden has declared a surprise war on me 3-6 times a game on the 6 or so I had her as my neighbor.  No one cares.  If I defend myself, I am a warmonger and everyone hates me.  If I conquer all of a civ except for the last two cities they will beg for peace, but they will refuse to return a city they conquered to start the war.  They will instead insist I keep all their other cities instead.  They will then spend the rest of the game denouncing me as a warmonger for doing as they begged me.  Such a stupid AI.  Also, hard to believe how limited the configurability is.  Want a better Civ game?  Get a copy of Civ4 or Civ5 (Civ5 will need the AI improvement mod).
I think Civilization and Sid Meier have taken a progressive step with this new installment.  We finally get to live in a world where Al Gore's aprocryphal predictions are realized (WE SHOULD HAVE LISTENED, why didn't we hang all those dirty white capitalists who are polluting our air!?) and we get to receive wise council from Mystery meat third worlders who speak to us in a Scottish accent and the UN and basically do our bidding as long we have enough of this anti-capitalist currency known as diplo points.  BRAVO SID MEIER, you focused on the aspects of Civilization that really matter, and left behind all those imperialist campaigns that have soiled your legacy.
It's not a bad expansion over all, but the AI is still really bad and it it massively overpriced. Pick it up at a 75 % sale instead.
This review I am giving will be a mixed one but overall due to lack of help from Support on the issue of my game crashing and getting no response from the support team I must give it a thumbs down overall. When I bought the game when it came out I was excited and it took awhile to get used to it but I had the chance to win with the Ottomans and Phoenicians (Dido) and was able to use the awesome robots to utmost efficiency and and play the new Civs except I hadnt played the Maori yet and probably wont get to now because my game crashes when I log on. I dont know if this is because of a Patch or something but the game wont play anymore and I submitted a work order a week ago with no response back. The game gives me the option to play under Directx12 which is installed in my PC but the game wont recognize it and I get an error message. So my advice to anyone thinking of buying this game just know that you might have the same issue I have but if you dont have the issue then I know you will enjoy the game playing the new civilizations and seeing the new technology that this game offers. If they cant fix my issue I wish I could get a refund but I know that wont happen even though this isnt my fault.
I enjoy the update, however, I do not recommend it. For me, the game is completely unplayable once World Congress unlocks during each game. I've come across several bugs that are not fixed. Such as: you can't view the proposals, cannot vote, clicking 'next' after a vote there is no response from the game. Trying to vote and cannot click on a specific leader, 'consider proposal' stuck on the turn button. For all of these I have to force the turn which is not ideal. I do not have any mods enabled, and I've completely uninstalled the game from steam and deleted all files from my computer and then re-installed. I've tried to verify the files (each time there is something corrupted) and they are downloaded. I've had enough. I will come back and play the game again in a few months after some patches have been made. I do really enjoy the natural disaster aspect and other additions but I won't waste any more time on it until these unplayable bugs are fixed.
Gathering Storm feels like a few neat mods yet costs the price of a brand new game.  I can't wait to be gouged by Civ VII.
Too little, too late, and for an unreasonable price.
Bloody expensive is what this is. Includes features that should have been in the base game.  Civ Devs should learn from paradox:  Implement mechanics for free Sell civs on the side  I'd prefer that for this kind of game, although even paradox messes you up.
Full of bugs.  Crashes on direct x 12 Crashes randomly if you use expansion leaders.  Avoid, I refunded it once I realiced I couldn't get a single game started.
For that price its total ripoff and kick in the nuts for all fans. Few mechanics that hardly affect the game and one new annoying win condition for a nearly full game price, nice.
First off - the world congress. It's nothing but an annoyance you're forced to participate in. Once an era or so.. starting in the bloody medieval era before you've even MET most of the world.. you and all the other leaders get together and vote on completely random things to screw with one another. It's not fun, and I wish it wasn't in the game at all.  Natural disasters. Yay. A volcano erupted, now I have to press the repair button and wait several turns while my district is fixed up. So engaging.  Climate change. Your cities on the coastline or near rivers flood. You'll lose coastal tiles late game, unless you build sea walls to prevent flooding. Do that and you basically negate the mechanic. Somewhat hilariously, though "polar ice" can melt to the point that 85% of it is supposedly gone.. it doesn't seem to actually disappear from the map and allow you to circumnavigate the globe via the poles. Go figure.  All in all, as with the "Rise and Fall" expansion most of what this adds actually makes the game worse or at best does little to nothing to improve anything. Not recommended.
Add quite a bit of new content, with some interesting story telling elements and diplomatic resolve. Overall a much needed update for the general quality of life (which should have already been in the game on release). I really don't know how I feel about spending $40 on it though... honestly seems worth more like $10. If I were to go back in time I'd tell myself to wait for a sale.
I wanted to believe, that this gonna be the “patch” which makes this game whole. I even waited with review after spending quite extensive time in game and giving devs the time for some patches…   [b]Pros[/b] [list] [*] Global warming idea (opens new strategies) [*] Implementing some ideas from previous Civs (Eg. Congress) [*] Leaders [/list] [b]Cons[/b] [list] [*] AI. It acts better in some ways (units decisions), but overall it is still terrible. Development, diplomacy decisions, trading… Just name it. You basically fight against yourself (and RNG), not trying to exploit stupid behavior. [*] UI is still “unfinished”. Thanks God for moders (Devs - why not take inspiration and give them some love?) [*] Overprized [/list] [b]Based on my game style[/b] [list] [*] Global warming, congress, tech tree… those are (generally speaking) late game things. And you don’t get into late/very late too much. So you not get much from it.  [*] Congress could be implemented much better [/list]  [b]Conclusion:[/b] [list] [*] I don’t recommend. Does not bring much, old problems stays.  [*] I made a bad decision buying it and lost my hope with Firaxis. They may have good intentions but implementations and focus is terrible. [*] For the prize of this DLC you can buy 2+ other full games which may give you a more joy. If you are nostalgic, just wait for gold edition. Or buy it in sales this summer. [/list]
This expansion is really sad. The climate change mechanic is really half hearted, nothing really happens except that droughts keep popping up in the same spots at Level 8, rendering the area time and time again. They have added a future era for whatever reason because it literally offers no solutions to tackle climate change except for completely ineffectual world congress votes everyone ignores. The AI does not care about climate change at all. Why include the future era if you don't get anything to actually respond to climate change? The whole expansion has proven to be more of a nuissance rather than offering interesting new challanges. I can NOT recommend this mess.
The game itself and this DLC is a buggy mess. Don't buy. Half my civs have no color, and none of their units have color or even a flag above their heads. No mods, mods, it doesn't matter. Game is broken right now, stay away.
The Natural Wonder ZHANGYE DANXIA and  RORAIMA does not appear in DLC Gathering Storm. This is wrong.Please fix it.
AI still terrible, so if you're one of the many waiting for a better AI, I'm sorry.  The climate change aspect of this expansion really just worsened the gameplay for me. The sea level rise offers no gameplay for me beyond just looking at the elevation of the land and planning my cities as if half the coast is going down, no matter what. It really has gotten to a point where I've considered just playing without the expansion, but there are several features of the it I do like.  Haven't figured out yet if there's any way to just switch off the sea level rise, because it seems just pointless.  From what I can tell there literally is no way to stop this from happening, unless you spend your entire game focusing solely on that. I play at Emperor, because that's the only way the AI will make the game somewhat entertaining, and the idea that I'm supposed to focus on this useless aspect of the game when I can barely keep up with the 10 other aspects of the game, is just not happening.  So stopping the sea level rise is impossible, and the flood barrier invention is placed so that it usually arrives 200 years after stage 3 flooding is finished. It's ridiculous. Maybe if you get a 100% perfect game and rush science while ignoring everything else you could research flood barrier by the time the sea level begins to rise, but even then the flood barrier takes way too long to built. And just completely forget about stopping the sea level from rising. I wonder how Fireaxis thought their AI who can't even make a logical attack order would be able to cooperate with eachother to stop climate change. Of course it's not working. Even if you do everything in your power to stop emissions nobody else does. It's pointless on the surface, but the idea that you're supposed to do some Paris Climate Accord style cooperation with the dumbest AIs ever made is pretty ridiculous.   The storms/volcanoes also offer nothing to the game. A "natural disaster" is much less of a disaster than one barbarian unit raiding your base, yet you can ask for global assistance whenever it happens. You're essentially making bank from natural disasters because they're laughably meaningless yet the game pretends as if it's devastating and the whole world community has to help.  It all just seems very poorly implemented, and it doesn't seem like they really spent a lot of time playing with the finished product..   For me it has just mainly added and incredibly uneccessary, unrealistic and annoying part of the game where basically any coastal city will have most of its tiles destroyed permanently from something you simply can't stop unless you want to make the whole game about the most boring feature of the game - namely climate change.   Do not recommend. 
Beware, since I bought the Add-on Rise and Fall, the game kept crashing my Mac each time I start a new game and the support won't reply de my emails, I tried to buy and install Gathering Storm hoping it would solve the issue, waste $40 and still no answers from the support.
Not only does this expansion finally bring features that should've been in the game since the start (World Congress...), the Diplomatic Victory is also horribly balanced. It's hard to achieve, not because of the enemy AI, but because you're likely to get a culture or science victory before you're even close to a diplomatic victory even if you aren't actively trying to.  Not only that but once you have some victory points the AI simply refuses to trade diplomatic favor with you under any circumstance, which takes out a lot of the potential gameplay from trying to achieve a diplomatic victory.  For example, in one game I was playing as Sweden and was sitting on 1 diplomatic victory point while all the other civs had 0. In this circumstance, they would not trade a single diplomatic favor to me even if I literally offered to give them all my cities for just 1 favor. This is not a smart or logical AI.
Politics aside, Climate Change/Power was a bad idea.  It introduces mechanics that exist only to punish.  It will happen, even if you're playing "green," and everyone suffers.  It really puts a downer on the late game.  They clearly were trying to make this dlc a lesson, not fun for gameplay.  It says: Here have the power mechanic, but if you use it you are a monster.  With Climate Change being not an actual character you can fight.  It just gives you punishment for being a civ.  It is clearly just there to be edutainment to make players more aware of climate change, but falls completely flat as a mechanic.  Also, they said that they had originally planned to include continuations of the military unit lines into the future.  They excitedly said they threw that all out for the "Giant Death Robot."  thats stupid.  I know its a civ joke like nuclear Gandhi, but Civ V included them with also having cool units like XCOM and Stealth bombers and all that.  I guess they were trying to be "cute" but they fell on their faces.  Gathering Storm is overpriced, kitschy, and preachy.  This was disappointing after the Rise & Fall expansion which I found decent,  Go back to Civ V or better yet get Imperator: Rome in April or any other PDS strategy title.
over-complicated. UX is total garbage.  Overpriced given lack of polish.  If you manage to get a valuable strategic resource that none of the other civs have, get ready to reject trade requests repeatedly. The stockpiling mechanic is more realistic, but this unfortunate side-effect gets old pretty fast.  They did add production queues, but I can hardly give points for that because it was already in Civ 5. It's not really an improvement to add a feature after removing it without good reason.  Diplomacy is also boring, and tedious. Civs will continually try to make trade deals for these.
Can NO longer enter the game with DX12 after installing this expansion!!!!!!!!!! Hope this issue can be fixed soon!!!!!!!!
Biggest addition in this 40$ expansion pack, are constant crashes, which weren't present in the base game. Every 20 or so turns expect the joy of watching unskippable intro, and long loading screen with narrator mispronouncing your leader's name.
This expansion was fine, but greatly overpriced. When you can get civ 5 for a fraction of the price (which has way better mods) and this expansion doesn't add that many new things, its not worth it. It might be worth it if you didn't buy rise and fall as this gives you some of the content from that, but even so, I would not buy it  again at its base price of $40. $20 would be more reasonable for what you get.
Not mod user friendly, even if you have supporting mods to avoid crashing.
Why tags, labels and icons are transparent that units and cities can not be selected? Fix the bug first pls.
Um. So... what is supposed to be different? I'm up through the ages of rifles and cannons and I've yet to spot a single obvious new thing happening to the game.   The good news is the game seems a touch more responsive and faster overall.  The bad news is... what the heck does this $40 expansion actually offer????   This is one of those hand halfway up.. I don't not recommend it, I don';t particular recommend it either
It is broken. Too many bugs + game crashes randomly
DO NOT BUY THIS! IT IS BUGGED!  This expansion is unfortunately so bugged that its unplayable. Until theyve fixed all the defects, i cannot recommend anyone purchasing this product. I am an avid CIV1-6 player, and ive never experienced Firaxis delivering something so poorly created. Support is no help either.
There are some good aspects and some bad ones. Overall, it does not feel like a well designed expansion.  [b]Grievances[/b] This is seems like a transparent system for diplomacy.  [b]Strategic Resources[/b] The stockpile is great for trading.   [b]Climate Change[/b] With increasing emissions temperature rises, the ice melts and some tiles submerge. Melting ice can actually be quite useful, as this might allow passage for your ships. Flood barriers can save fertile land from flooding. The cities themselves do not seem to be affected. The climate changes stops at a maximum threshold and further emissions do not seem to have any effect at all.  So just pollute the world, build flood barriers.  [b]The World Congress[/b] The player cannot influence the resolutions during the congress. Also, asking other cilivizations to support your cause during voting for the different resolutions is not possible. For emergency situations that affect the player get's the option to call upon the world congress in order to ask for help.   [b]Giant Death Robot[/b] The other advanced civilizations had five or more of these beasts. This number is totally insane, as there is hardly any uraniumto support them. With two/three bombers I could simply bombe them away.  [b]Army Groups[/b] You can combine warrior units with generals and alike. The general should simply stay with the unit and follow it. However,  the general required specific orders every other turn. It should simply stay with the group and follow it's orders  [b]Railroads[/b] These enable fast travel and are super convenient. What's not so convenient is that you have to manually build the tracks on every tile. No automation to build between two tiles/cities.   [b]Power system[/b] Factories require power. Power is produced in power plants by consuming strategic resources. Later in the game green alternatives make these obsolete. There is no overview showing how much power is created and what resources are consumed. At some point transfering power via high-voltage power line between cities would be quite nice.  
This expansion was fun for a few turns but... The very bad thing about this game is the AIs. They are too easy to conquer the cities without any attempt to kill my units at all. I just use some few artillery to bombard city defend, and just walk into city to take it as cakewalk, no resistant or unit to attack me at all.  I don't know because I choose warlord difficulty or not. But this is very boring... 
Meh.
Gotta love the doorknobs reviewing this expansion who think introducing science into a game is "getting political".  Hee haw, buckeroos, time to think again.  I give this expansion a bad review for the same reason the base game now has a bad review:  New Civ6 EULA: "The information we collect may include personal information such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, phone number, photo, mailing address, geolocation, or payment information. In addition, we may collect your age, gender, date of birth, zip code, hardware configuration, console ID, software products played, survey data, purchases, IP address and the systems you have played on. We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use."
Really disappointed, much of these changes are needed and should have been free. But the propaganda, SJW and horrible cause and effect is a joke and ruins the game. Bugs from civ 6 still aren't fixed breaking the game more at times. Sadly I like many of the changes, railroads, tunnels across mountains and weather. Adding more end game eras and tech. However the giant robot and other units are also a joke. The oversears of this game can't figure out if they are making a cartoon or a history game. As a life long gamer, lover and supporter of Civ I'm really pissed off by the direction and garbage being added to this game. The energy that could have been put in to making the game really stand out was put in to ruining the game with unreasonable carbon garbage. The nuke plants, coal and other climate change is such a joke Al Gore himself must have been involved. I'm surpprised Man Bear big didn't make it as a unit.
Way overpriced for what it is. I thought there was a lot more to it, a lot more "new" features. It wasn't until playing for a while that I started to have memories of "I'm sure I've seen all these features before". The nuclear issues, the sea rising, pollution causing issues and the mechs! I'm sure I've seen the mechs before. And the UN. Then it hit me. All these features where in previous Civ games, from the beginning, not as DLC.  As far as I can see, they've taken all these features out of the base game to get the game shipped. Then decided they could add them in at a later day as a DLC and charge a high price for it. Unfortunately I only realised after I'd played over the refund time limit.  Worth it if you can get it super discounted, not worth it at full price.
The features added in gathering storm enhance the gameplay of civ 6 however it is not worth the price tag and I am unable to give it a positive review due to the continual desyncing during online and local play which makes playing those modes impossible.
The DLC is good but not worth the price  There IS quite a bit of contend in the DLC, but nowhere near enough to justify the current price tag. The desasters are allright, but there is no real chance to play in a really hostile world. I routinely play with disasters on maximum and next to nothing happens, which is somewhat underwhelming. The world congress is... ok I guess, but it would be nice if you would have more choice or actively push for decisions to happen. I routinely find myself overflowing with political influence, not knowing what to do with it, since why should I care about religion if no religion is about to be dominant? Speaking of religion: I find myself constantly opting out of the religious part of the game, since aside from a constant religious war, that often drags you into an actual war as well, there is no way to properly use it anymore, since all the KI does is spam missionarys to spread a faith that usually can do nothing for you than producing and spreading faith. On a positive note, the KI is now more friendly and you don't get attacked by people that like you out of the blue. Also buying great works from the KI is now easier, but still expensive. An odd thing that still happens a lot is: "Hello would ou give me 2 great works and attack your friend together with me?" offers...
This very expensive DLC improves the base game, but it doesn't bring it up to the standard of Civ V.
Game keeps crashing on Dx11 and Dx12.  I would have never purchased if I knew they were going to introduce the "Global Warming/changing" crap!!  Dont spend money on this release!
Honestly, Rise and Fall had a better system and balance to the game play. This expansion now adds future Science and Culture bits, it also adds 2 extra bars to get a Science victory and adds more headaches to get Culture victory. So, pretty much it takes too long to get a Science and Culture victory. And if you spam during meetings, you could easily get the 10 points to win via Would Council. But there's the issue, you really don't have any true say in getting the points. You only meekly vote on things, and then after you vote, it's usually flipped and you lose to the AI. No alliances, underhanded tactics, or anything that makes this more exciting. Just vote and pray.  So basically, this only adds another spamming type of way to win. Either spam during these "meetings," spam Religious units, or spam military units. By the way, you are forced to vote on things. You don't have the ability to tell the counsel to go "shove it," and you don't get the ability to just not vote, or move to pass, on an item. Speaking of the latter, the whole "Global Warming" thing will automatically happen when you get into a more modern military. It's unexplained, and it will end up with you as the inadvertent, and unexplained, hit on you in pollution (that really doesn't have too much of a negative effect, and probably would take a lot for it to cause issues like that...Which you would probably feel the brunt of more than others).   As in other words, this DLC throws everything out of whack. Rise and Fall was better as it balance in comparison, with less needless complications, that actually made that DLC fun to play (still spammish with Religion and Military, but with a Science route that is easier to achieve, and doesn't require to have to grind out to almost the end, it almost negated it). You aren't forced into taking part in a UN sort of deal. And you could actually play the game out and it would feel that all your work would be appreciated. Here, Science/Culture victories are unnecessarily difficult to achieve, and by the time you get remotely to that point, someone else already is 2 away from wining via the UN, or had already spam-bombed you with Religion.
Finally makes Civ 6 worth playing over 5, too bad I have to pay 40€ and 30€ the last expansion to make a 60€ game playable.
World Congress makes no sense and is perhaps the dumbest thing in a game that is otherwise not dumb.
This could all just be in the main game. There is no new product here. Adds stupid mechanics that are technically not very deep. World congress has been in the base game every time. Now they gate it behind a $40 paywall. Would not recommend
What the hell did I pay $40 for? The new rules haven't required me to alter my game play in any way. Save your money and wait for a sale. This is not worth the money and I'm ashamed I fell for this crap, again.
This expansion allows one of the greatest civilizations in the world (Canada) to join the game and with the introduction of climate change & resource management, it gives the game some interesting new mechanics that change the way Civilization works. However, the main issue with Civilization 6 still exists, that being the AI doesn't adapt to any of the changes and still has no idea how to build successful cities. The AI drops down cities with all the planning of a 1 year old playing with toy blocks,  neglects to intelligently gather Luxury/Strategic resources and frequently forgets to bombard with garrisoned ranged units.  The new mechanics seem to be completely ignored by the AI as well, not developing tiles that are enriched by volcanoes, leveraging diplomatic power  or repairing their tiles when destroyed by natural disasters. I'm sure it would be great for multiplayer, but otherwise there is no need to buy this expansion at full price, excluding the desire to play any of the new civilizations.
I have some issues and disappointments with this expansion.   First, the new civilizations are really... bland. None of them really change the way I play the game. Making traditionally worthless tiles more valuable seems boring to me. Then there's the one that starts in the ocean, the one with some diplomatic addition, and.. what else? They are so boring, I've already forgotten about it.   Second, the environmental additions just seems to be more of an annoyance than something to plan around or use to your advantage. Doesn't really change my gameplay. It just happens and you continue clicking for the next turn. No big deal. Couple of population lost that will come back in a couple of turns. So what.   Finally, the diplomatic system just doesn't make much sense, and it's really bland, once again. You acquire another currency, and can spend it on worthless vote, like, stop trading with this player, or some other shit that seems like a waste of time.   In the end, I was playing through a game with the expansion, and the game felt the same, just with some added annoyances, some forgetable civilizations, and a couple of new systems that does not add any excitement for me at least.   I would not recommend buying this until a discount, or maybe just don't buy it, and stick to the base game and the first expansion.
I don't know how to rate this one.  Gathering Storm is fun and adds lots new features that are almost worth the full price.  However, the fact that my game crashes every 10 turns or so makes this a less then a pleasant experience.  For reference, my game which included the previous expansion did not crash before.
Although I'm not a native English speaker, I will just write in English so that developers can read it.  I've started playing Civilization series since Civ 3.   I know the game designer has changed since CIV 5. It's become simple so much compared with CIV 3 or 4.  I remember in Civ 3, I could begin war as soon as I made peace with the same civ. But since Civ 5, many rules have been introduced, and the rules force you not to do such things.  To me, Civ 3, 4 was realistic, you could do anything you want as long as you can bear the consequences.  I don't say Civ 5 wasn't fun, but it became just a game. At least to say, it was a good balance between realistic and game.  Civ 6 was also fun to me, but every time DLC is released, it's losing reality.  Rise and Fall, what are emergencies? it's adding a fun element to the game, but I don't understand who is hosting it, and who pays money?   Gathering storm, what do you mean by world congress where there are many civs who I don't know and I am a part of it.   Civ's ability or leader's ability, characteristics used to be just a spice of the game. But now what?  it's the main feature of the game.  Why they are like so?  Not realistic at all. Why I find the series fun? because it makes me wonder If the earth was like the one generated in this game, how the world was developed.  But now, there's no essence of realistic. (Well, there is a realistic feature of nature, but so what? The main thing is to me, not civilization, geographic.  I like to see how the world develops depending on geography.  Well, I know this game is not simulation, it's strategy game. So probably I am the wroing guy who plays this. Probably, I shouldn't buy Civ 7 or later.     
its overpriced
I wanted to like it. I really did. You will like it until a flood wipes out your capital city in the first 20 turns on Emperor level and you are perma-ruined by a flood that you had no control over. This expansion does little more than add a 'chance' element to your gameplay that could either help you by ruining your enemies, or ruin you and help your enemies. It's very hit or miss. The expanded tech tree is nice, the new wonder improvements are great. The resource bonuses make it so it's not as hard to come across late game resources. The natural disasters absolutely ruin you, especially early game. Global warming seems to happen no matter what 'green technologies' you use. You will lose all of the low-lying tiles. It's almost a guarantee. I replaced all my coal with oil and then nuclear and I still lost my coast. I had barriers, but it  ruins your ability to produce anything in the flooded tiles as well. Um, that's about it. It's so hit or miss that I'm going to just say to miss it...
This is a great expansion, but one thing drives me insane with Gathering Storm, all the glitches in the game  It seems like the developers rushed this out (I do like content) but then never fixed any of the bugs that people face  I have clicked the windows key and went to google and Gathering storm went "Oh you wanted to turn down the resolution to something unsuitable for your monitor"  I have verified the game files of this game 3 times and the game still has issues
way too overpriced.
Way overpriced !
Tried to play the new game and there is zero mechanic to stop the global warming or even slow it down.  The temp increase talks about deforistation, but I planted 30 spots of trees and all that happened was the temp increase continued to go faster.  I had 3 sea level rises in 4 turns.  Need to fix the logic there or is it simply a political statement.  The other disasters were random and created a nice change of pace to the game.  Having to go through and rebuild after a tornado or replant after a river floods or a hurricane or volcano.  It is simply the CO2 emissions logic that is seriously flawed. 
Game sucked for $40
Pros:   No warmongering!  Some new units and Civs.  Production queue!  No warmongering!  Cons: This expansions mechanics don't feel very balanced on marathon.  The AI grossly undervalues the new resources gathered; including the new diplomatic points.  I was hoping trade balance had been improved but they still screw you over in any trade.  Any amount of resources over 20 and the AI flips out.  Nuclear reactors blow up approximately every 45 turns (or less) IF they haven't been recommissioned on marathon (it would take me 15 turns to recommission it).  They also have multiple meltdowns which defies logic.  Wouldn't a reactor be offline after a a meltdown rather than keep pumping that radiation out?  YOUR REACTORS WILL STILL MELT DOWN MULTIPLE TIMES AFTER CONVERTING BACK TO OIL POWER TOO!!!!  Trade routes are vulnerable to radiation and cannot be changed; they are also too retarded to avoid fallout from your Oil plant's radiation leaks and meltdowns.  Climate change is kind of cute but seemed skewed since I could get the top tier, by myself, by the mid1900s. It's easiest just to avoid building in flood areas until you get flood walls because, at least for me, climate change is happening and it's not as scary as it should be.  I might go out on a limb and say natural disasters were more often/painful early game.  Carbon Capture's tooltip is also incorrect.  It says you can accumulate reductions against the global CO2 footprint- but jack shit happens when you do it repeatedly past 0 on your counter.  Climate change does not reverse, ever.    I'm extra sad that MEGACOLASSAL volcano eruptions don't cause global cooling, as they do IRL. (aka give us this and the option to nuke a volcano to cause cooling on purpose)  It would be annoying, but interesting, to get a mini ice age that affects farms in pre-industrial eras.  Still can't delete awkward districts that AI build, better to still raze the crappier towns if you need the space.  Barbarians are still ridiculous because they are more productive than most towns and respawn the round after you clear them out.  World congress was inconsequential in most circumstances with AI.  The colluded my first game, but worked correctly in my second game.  When an AI wants peace, they are going to ask every round now.  There is no way to block their spam.  Loyalty system is not intuitive i.m.o. and you can lose a town faster than you can establish your governor or conquer it.  I can appreciate needing to strategize how to capture cities, but losing them the round after capture made razing a seksi option.  Bread and Circus is a must.  You can eliminate every civilization WITHOUT getting a domination victory if one of the capitals becomes a "Free City".  You still have to manually click future civic and future tech repeatedly.  IF only these could be automatic.  It would also be nice if you stopped accumulating governor points when they are all MAXED.  Military Engineers need a "Route To" or Auto improvement option for railroads.  A few thousand extra clicks and hundreds of screen pans to build railroad on a continent is tedious.  Kupe is overpowered AF, IMO.  Gave me a serious run for my money on king difficulty.  Played him next game and started off climate change with a Death Robot and almost all civics found in 1785AD.  Upgrading the Rock Bands with the ability to reduce city loyalty by 50 seemed to break them and make them useless.
Gathering Storm looked like a promising new expansion to Civ6. I am a fan of the series since the second civ, only skipping the first one because i was too young. I can't recommend it for now, and i will explain why:  First, the global warming feature. It reads really nice on paper, but the implementation isn't great. Its just about rising sea levels. Why is this bad? Because you can counter most effects. Tornados, eruptions, and storms aren't too bad at all. Flooding rivers and rising sea levels can COMPLETELY be countered. So no reason to worry. Extinction of animals? More desert tiles? Erosion? Nothing like that. Just the rising sea and it counter-measures. But the worst thing is, just coal is enough to start the melting of the poles. In my game, around 18XX, the sea starts to rise, just for burning coal to create electricity in the beginning of industrialization. Thats way too fast. You don't have a chance to get to clean energy to counter this. The moment you get clean energy, the whole flooding thing is already done.  Second, the new ressource system is horrible. In the old system, you need 1 strategic ressource to build a unit in a city with an encampment district, or 2 if you want to build them in any city. With the new system, you get a flat amount (+2) per round per ressource depot. A unit costs 20 of a ressource to build, so a SINGLE (!) swordsman cost 10 rounds of ressource savings. Let that sink. Sure, you can trade, but the AI/other player have the same problems. Its hard to keep a healthy amouts of troops.  Its getting even worse with the modern ressources: Uran, oil and coal. You need them for fueling your troops and creating electricity. But they are so scarce, its not even enough to create enough electricity. Only way to get enough energy is to spam "local clean energy": Solarpanels, windfarms and offshore-windfarms. Don't even think about building infantry or tanks!  In conclusion: they multiplied the need for ressources, but they don't multiplied the spawn rate and/or yield per tile.  The science victory got nerfed, dunno if this is good or bad, but you need more time/projects to win with science. You can decide for yourself if this is good or bad. Some of the new features, like the world congress, are working fine, but they are overshadowed by the not working/lackluster features.  It feels like i am not playing a civilization game anymore. More like a strange anti-global-warming-cuddle-civ: Don't build too much military, fight the global warming and build nice happy, green and clean energy buildings on every tile. For a high addon price!  If they patch things, i will change my review, but for now, i can't say enough positive to justify a thumb up.
Never build a city in snow area. I can not imagine an ice storm can destroy the entire population. Stupid settings.  Other parts actually are okay, but the original price... I say wait for sale.
Well, I'm trying really hard to like it and it does ad a bunch of content. That said, so far I am disappointed to the point I think I might go back to pre Gathering Storm expansion. I want a game, not some eco activist attempt at global warming and one ruling global government. I like the idea of adding power to cities to make them function better, making it a "global warming" issue though just takes away from this being an entertaining game and turns into some groups attempt at drawing you into some political movement. It's to bad because I really enjoy this type of game.
This expansion is an improvement: Civ6 is now about at 40% towards an enjoyable game.  You build a lot of stuff which doesn't mean much.  You are also lonely because the AI is brain dead.  Side remark: The music is very repetitive and constantly bombastic thus damaging your poor ear canal.  To brighten you up a joke: it costs $40.
The new content is an overall improvement but the price is ridiculous.  I'm disappointed in myself for spending $40 on this.  It's worth maybe $15.  They still haven't fixed the AI either.
AI still as bad as before.
Civ VI original game is great but  this DLC is not worth it. Not enough contents for 40$ !!!!! I really regret buying it. They still didn't fix the directional arrow bug after years of development.. Big NO to this DLC.
Try again Firaxis 5/10
good high key garbage low key garbage pls fix want my russian rubel back zank u ;)
It's OK, but not worth full price.
$40 for an unplayable broken DLC. As soon as you hit world congress, there is a good chance you will not be able to progress any further. I sunk a few hours into a game and then got completely stuck because I couldn't cast my votes.
Can't play Civ 6 anymore - needed to uninstall Gathering Storm to play.  Don't buy this until they learn how to smoke test software before releasing it for $40...
Great expansion just the price is a bit much. $40 is $10 over what you should be paying. Get this when it's on sale.
Game is decent, but needs a lot of balancing and bug fixes until I can recommend it at this price. 40 eur? Nope.  Diplomacy is broken: AI is making silly choices and demands left and right, if you play with more than 6 civilization you will go crazy with the amount of stupidity AI offers you each turn (not to mention trade offer spam which mostly is ridiculous)   World congress: Very disappointed. It's unrealistic and deals mostly with resources. Imagine all the world leaders coming together and deciding what to do with extra spices or camels. Basically, you will see this: A: Resource X brings +1 amenities. B: Resource X brings no amenities.  Needs a lot of improvement  And finally, environment effects: YOU DONT FEEL THEM. The most advertised feature is really underpowered and you hardly notice it. Just click away notifications and build the right improvements.  Anyhow, until these things are fixed, I can't recommend getting the game at 40 eur, wait for a discount.
At $40 which is already arguably over priced for DLC I expected this DLC to be nearly bug free. Unfortunately that wasn't the case, and right off the bat I've encountered multiple game breaking bugs. Hopefully I'll be able to refund this and will consider repurchasing this DLC and changing this review if and when Firaxis makes an effort to correct these bugs.
Overpriced
Very sorry but this DLC is not worth ca40€ - so unless you are a really big fan of Civilization or just super curious (which I was), wait for 50% discount. The positive thing I really like is the paradigm shift towards cleaner, friendlier and more diplomatic world. But - as many others have said already below - some really great ideas have got a really poor realization.  My deepest disappointment is the long waited World Congress! Ugly UI and totally bizarre choices as well as the whole election system! Totally miss the old Civ 5 one that was simple, yet somehow very aesthetic and understandable! In conclusion - the DLC has some good and some very ideas which came out - unfortunately - in quite a raw format.
Updated Review. Score: 7/10  Having logged over 1,500 hours between Civilization 6 and countless more on previous installations, I feel qualified to give my opinion on this DLC. I, after all, hold a Facebook University degree and have lived in my mother's basement.   [b]TL:DR: If Civ 6 and Civ 5 had a love child, conceived during an ecstasy induced trip on a organic, cruelty-free rug while it was weathering outside, the Gathering Storm DLC would be it. Unfortunately, the child came out autistic.  Translation: Not worth the full price - needs tweaking.   Relationship status with the DLC: We're on talking terms.[/b]    [b]Environment[/b] Gathering Storm adds some unique and beautiful environmental effects to the base game. However, these effects even at the default setting occur way too frequently. Despite a fair balancing of destruction and creation by natural disasters (i.e. a volcanic eruption destroying tiles and then adding a +2 production bonus to the altered tiles, or a flood destroying tiles and then adding a +2 food bonus), these natural disasters feel like an inevitable. While floods can be mitigated with dams to a large extend, a volcano is more damning. If you settle near a volcano, it's guaranteed that it will erupt - and continue to erupt. There's no assumed gamble here - that perhaps you get lucky by settling near a volcano that is dead, or will die at some point later in the game. Because of this, these tiles are not capitalized on beyond general worker improvements. [b]Verdict: Set your disaster setting to 1 before starting a game.[/b]   [b]Wonder Galore[/b] Wonders don't really feel like wonders. Sure, there's that pretty animation and there can only be one. But honestly, I felt that every time I advanced in the tech or civic tree, I'd have too many options to build a wonder along the way. Do we really need to cram every known wonder into a game? Probably not. It feels like Firaxis lost self control in front of the vanity, using all the make-up in the drawer, and walking out like a cheap date or a Tinder encounter. Less can be more. I promise. Regardless, you should still probably avoid building most wonders, and just conquest an opponent's city who has done the work for you.   [b]New Civilizations[/b] Speaking of Tinder encounters... the DLC offers "9" new leaders. Really it's just 8 leaders, Eleanor of Aquitaine (how do you pronounce that? Aq...ui...taint..e.. Jesus) is just re-skinned and can be played as England or France. Maybe I don't appreciate the historical record here, but really? MAGA-wearing Trumpets might be as equally confused at the lack of patriotism coming from Eleanor. This seems like a missed opportunity by Firaxis to introduce a stand alone and unique 9th leader, or provide the Eleanor re-skin option as an unlockable feature by completing a scenario or game condition. For instance, if you play Eleanor (as players like to play), you instead opt to date her evil twin sister (France), because she's more exciting. Draw me like one of your French girls.    [b]Scenarios[/b] Haven't tried it yet. Although, I'm eager to try the Black Death scenario. Two things that never get old: dark humor and unvaccinated children. Shots fired (vaccine shots).   [b]Consumable Resources[/b] Resources are no longer limited to just production, but have been expanded to include city and unit maintenance. For instance, oil will be constantly consumed from your production rate to run your tank. Further, there is a limit to how much of a resource you can have stored for unit production. The cache can be upgraded with military buildings. This makes trading for resources a more appealing venture and also adds further consider where to settle cities for resources. I at first did not like this feature, but it's grown on me considerably.   [b]Manipulation of Terrain Features[/b] As you advance through the tech tree, you will now be able to build tunnels through mountains to allow more efficient unit movement or build canals that allow ships to travel through short segments of river. I'm a fan of this feature as it allows for  a benefited defense position by settling near a mountain range to transition to a more economic trade route or aggressive play.    [b]World Congress[/b] The World Congress provides a more dynamic option range than its former installations across the Civ platform. You're more often than not presented with a general question (i.e. What type of city-state... or what type of luxury... should be modified to do x). You vote on a number of topics (ya or nay), add how many ya or nays you want to contribute to the decisions, and select from a drop down menu on what specific type of modifier you want to see (i.e. trade routes get +4 gold for x person, and you'd select a civilization that is deserving (more than likely, you'd select yourself).    [b]Gameplay Improvements[/b] There's Giant Death Robots... so there's that.   I'll probably update this again in the near future when I've played more. Or not.
EDIT: I also just learned of the EULA. They came out with a data collection overreach, back-tracked because of consumer backlash and with gathering storm they did it again.  "The information we collect may include personal information such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, phone number, photo, mailing address, geolocation, or payment information," reads the new EULA for Civilization VI. "In addition, we may collect your age, gender, date of birth, zip code, hardware configuration, console ID, software products played, survey data, purchases, IP address and the systems you have played on. We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use."  Thesis statement, "More is not always better."  Civilization 6 already went overboard in the base game, expanded on it in rise and fall, and even more so in gathering storm. There are thousands of game details that you ultimately need to know if you want any kind of chance at playing at a semi-competitive level. If you want any chance of completing a single game within a reasonable time frame you'll need to memorize all of these things to avoid having to look EVERYTHING up as you play. - A very intricate and deep web of adjacency bonuses for city districts/wonders - A deep layer of painstakingly strict terrain requirements for wonder building - The worst implementation of religion in any civ game ever. If you dare plan a religious victory or even just start your own, prepare yourself for a tedious game-long commitment to constant spamming of religious units and sending them all over while trying to maintain your religious foothold. - The same tired AI diplomacy where you commit the slightest inconveniences and a thousands year long ally hates you. That, and the every-turn "hey trade us this we've been asking for every turn for the last 200 turns" and you still have no interest in the trade - similiar to the previous 199 refusals. - Specialized governors that are only useful if placed in the correct cities and even then often have very limited use (+x% production toward city center buildings) so beyond loyalty, basically irrelevant after only a few turns. - Deep collection of government civics that are also only useful for very specific purposes and only at specific points, so to really play effectively you have to CONSTANTLY change them - Keeping track of loyalty, housing and amenities in large empires is exhausting, and Civ 6, especially compared to 5, going for large empires is basically required because of city districts and wonders requiring land tiles that are at a premium - I'm sure there is more, but these are just a few of the high points that make the game a tedious and unenjoyable MICRO-management civilization as opposed to previously designed civs which had a greater MACRO-management feel. They weren't so bogged down in thousands of little details that just add a bunch of unnecessary "fluff" to the game.
Way overpriced!! For such little content, it should be between $10-15. Not more. $40 is almost a price for a full game... Learn from TWWH - Much better deals for lots of content... :(
Well, the content of this DLC is pretty solid. Those new leaders and new characters are rather good. However, the introduction of the new mechanism didn't change the game a lot -- you're still doing the same thing as you did before in the rise and fall. The influence of the climate change was rather small if you start the game from the beginning. Also, there are few bugs such like the disasters are not matched to the environment. Generally speaking, the DLC changed the civilization VI, but it is still civilization VI. No much surprise.
The producer of this game has through the EULA encrouched heavily on my privacy and is collecting information which is not necessariy for the development of the game.  I question the lawfullness under European GDPR laws.  I have requested a refund and will deinstall the game.  A true waste of a legendary title. Shame on you Firaxis.
Game only for SINGLE PLAYER. Cannot wage war anymore due to strategic resources. Made the game very noob friendly. Winner is decided in turn 1 based on starting location
eleanor of aquitane
I prepaid for this game a weeks ago, and I cant even download it, cheating huh?
Incredible how they can implement such interesting features in such a pathetically dumb way.   Want to win a diplomatic victory? Impossible with 6 or more AI/players. Opponents can choose to take your diplomatic victory points away and will do so if you get close to victory. Now you might be thinking - well that sounds reasonable. Except that they will continue to do it, and you can't outvote them no matter how much diplomatic favour you save up. I played against 8 AI who only had to spend 10 diplomatic points (for 2 votes each), while to match that, it would have taken me 1300 points. And they usually spend more than 10 just to be sure. And you won't make those up because you only get 3 or 4 rounds of voting for points before the games ends another way - making diplomatic an impossible victory type on anything larger than a tiny map.   Then we have pollution. Great idea! Until my 4 battleships somehow lead the ice caps to melt by 1900AD. Yeah, a few units running on coal destroy most coastal tiles by 1900AD. Well before you research or build flood barriers. I didn't even build ANY coal or oil plants because I wanted to play green. But no - you either build a minimal army and melt the ice caps, or build no military and get conquered.  Then we come to future techs. Want to win a science victory? Well now you have to be lucky because the order of future techs is random - so while you may have to research 6 or 7 techs to complete the final phase of the science victory, your opponent may have to only complete 2 (one that lets you build the thing, then another that speeds it up 100%-1000% faster). So if your opponent gets the lucky tech that speeds up the final stage - you have to sit there waiting 50 turns (on standard speed) for the thing to arrive and claim victory.  Lastly, either the devs have released a early build of it or they have completely ignored these stupid (and at times game-killing) issues. They stated on their live streams how extensively each of them play the game for testing. How does this slip past?  Diplomatic victory is a boring wait-fest, and now science victory is too. Great ideas but terribly implemented.
I don't understand all the glowing positive reviews, it adds a very small amount of things which aren't really all that interesting. It's basically including a lot of stuff that was in the second expansion to Civ 5 but dumbed down like that should be possible, some people say they've fixed diplomacy but all I get are even more pointless offers now for people offering diplomatic points like they're amazing. The environmental catastrophes are volcanoes, sand storms and rivers overflowing all of which aren't terribly interesting you'd think they'd incorporate elements from some of the cooler mods into the base game like the better trade (all of which need to be updated again to work) but they haven't.  There are new civs, some new tech, some different mechanics which are an improvement but for the price this is once again ridiculous. I wish I'd stop falling for it each time.   Probably giving me 0 hours because of those mods.
price tag is a joke for the content
I tried to start the game after buying this expansion and it won't even start. Says it's running for a couple of seconds then stops. Hope someone knows a way to resolve this issue as I see from other reviews that people are able to play.
crashes on startup =/
Yeah paid 40 bucks and it crashes on start, thanks Sid.
The barbarians are now out of control. Nothing seems to build the same, as far as time goes. It seems to take forever to get anything built. Far too much ocean, and not enough land. I've played on numerous maps, and the all have tons of ocean.  Can't they just add to the game, and not jack it up every time they come out with something new? Frustrated so far with this expansion.
The AI still needs major work.  I shouldn't be able to have a unit next to an enemy city and NOT be attacked by it's garrisoned unit... particularly when there is no way my individual unit could pose a threat to it.  (Warrior vs. Warrior very early game).  That same civ DID however send out a worker straight into my fledgling army later on (still leaving their warrior in the city).  I was playing on KING difficulty.  Thought that's worth sharing...  As for the expansion, there are a number of things I still hope to enjoy as a huge CIV fan.  Maybe the next game I create will have smarter civs to face.     While I hate to rate it this way, I have some regret in buying this expensive expansion to still once again face the weak AI let down.  I'd prefer the unit stacks from back in the day to the poor choices AI makes.
No option for disabling the jersey system?
I'm not seeing how this is a "WHOLE NEW GAME!" None of the improvements changed all that much.  The disasters are...pointless for the most part. Less a disaster and more a super mild inconvenience for a few turns. The AI is still broken and stupid. Still just as apt to go full on crazy for no reason what-so-ever.  Not worth it. You're paying $40 to get a few "new" leaders and be mildly annoyed for a few turns here and there.
AI has numerous obviously exploitable stupid behaviors.
This is where the game should have been at launch/release of base CIV6. $110 later makes it a decent experience. So if you get on discount it will be fun, but someone who was dumb enough to pay right away well I am disappointed. No way am i paying for civ7 unless it is on sale, and after all expansions have been released...
game crashes on game start up
Crashes.
The new features of this DLC are interesting, but the World Congress system is a broken, buggy mess (at least at my computer). The congress interface doesn't work. Since your vote is required if you want to get to the next turn, this bug renders the game unplayable after the first congress. Until they fix this huge bug, I can't recommend.
Very overpriced for what you get. it's ok so far, but $40? nah. i should have waited for a sale.
Horrifically overpriced for what it adds. This DLC should be no more than £15. If you really want it I would wait until a sale, but even then I doubt it will go down to £15.  £35 is a ridiculous amount for a few natural disasters, civs and wonders.
I'm modestly negative.   The general improvements, updating and expanded content are fine (although ww1 scenario is multiplayer). Diplomatic favor is sort of weird, but I accept that is the limits of what you can have in a video game.  The global warming system is plain bad- it would have been more intelligent to have climate change BE climate change fluctuating throughout history. Aside from the agenda nonsense your behavior is irrelevant since the AI also produces CO2. It isn't clear what kind of strategic trade offs and planning they are trying to add to the game with this.  The 21st century techs and civics are pretty thin. The diplomatic victory system is sort of crazy. You earn diplomatic victory points and win when you have enough- it isn't clear what this is supposed to model.  Edit The comments show there exist people who don't understand the civilization series or what they claim to be defending. I've posted a thread (Agenda Issues) where I go into detail but here are the things the expansion screws up that was done correctly in previous civilization games.  ---  -Nuclear power plants (and only nuclear power plants) have to have production regularly spent on them. (civilization 2 had nuclear accidents when cities fell into anarchy which made sense)  -There is no way to cooperate with other civilizations in order to deal with global warming. (Alpha Centauri had climate manipulation as one of the voting options for the planetary council)  -Climate change doesn't changes the climate- despite telling you the ice caps are melting, in game the ice does not melt. (Civilization 2 had tiles change eliminating tundra as the world warmed)  Edit 2  The moderator helpfully pointed out hydroelectric power is in game (it is an upgrade under dams). Also I'm banned from the forum. Therefore I'll post the rest of the issues- things they could have trivially improved.   -You can build solar plants in tundra terrain.  -The climate doesn't change until the modern era. Leaving out natural volitility, you have deforestation in the ancient era to make it an issue the entire game, but they don't.  -No high tech renewables- no molten salt solar plants or thermocline power plants  -No universal power generation despite this being something boosters of renewables talk about since it helps cover the issue of intermitant power generation.  -No coral bleaching. (passed up an opportunity to make global warming worse)
40€ for a dlc and force everyone to buy that dlc that wants to join a multiplayer game of someone who allready has it is a sick joke.
game is not installing. says purchased, not installed and that's it. restarted steam, updated, restarted cpu and just gives me the middle finger.
I really want to like it but I couldn't. Good additions they improved everything. Why I don't like it is because of new civilizations are too  outbalanced and somehow overpowered. Not recommended. That's up to you to get it if you want to. I just don't think this DLC is worthy a $40. I think I will stick with Civ5 anyways.
UI improvements, additional settings.  Love the mountain range / desert naming which I used to do myself with map markers.  New civs are always good.  This ridiculous climate model needs to be modded to fit reality, not Al Gore's fantasy.  Just from what the UI has told me CO2 goes up storms and disasters go up, sea level as well.  That isn't even true of the last five years not to mention last 20 years that was "predicted".  Could have been done with an ever changing even random climate model.  Last DLC was trash, one last chance.
there should be an option to disable. now im stuck with disasters.
Big fan of series, love Sid Meyer. But the DLC still hasn't launched and its been 11 minutes. A tad disappointed with Sid for this latency, not his best work.
Worst game
On the surface it looks great, afterhours of gameplay its a polished turd. Basically RNG is now in play and you can be winning the game and then get screwed over by disasters, also the C02 and flooding is silly and make it less fun. I cant recommend this if you get frustated with RNG and bad luck, i like games where skill shows 100% of the time.
Coming soon This item is not yet available.
Did not enjoy this too much. I like the graphics, the sprites, the adult content, but the controls are kind of clunky and the saving system is lacking - the checkpoints are very sparse. I played it on 'easiest' and still got frustrated (long time Spelunky player speaking). I would return it if I still could.
Not worth the price even on discount.  Controls are clunky and you have to figure out the controls on your own, as there is no tutorial. This game requires installation of DirectPlay, but there was no mention of it anywhere prior to purchase.  The pixel sex are not even interesting or funny. CGs are standard normal stuff, nothing exceptional here.  Seriously, keep your money and play other games.
Even for the price it's way too short
Not worth $5. Bad CG art, weird and un-remappable controls, and simplistic gameplay. I returned it.
This game isn't that bad, the game play is good and the fighting can sometimes be challenging. The H-scenes aren't bad either and some are quite well made. My biggest issue is when you try to change the button mapping you can potentially break the whole game and make it difficult to play at all. I will change my review when this issue has been fixed.
One of the main reasons why this game is difficult is because of the poor controls and the inability to change them: when I first launched the game, I went to the Options menu to see what the controls for the game are. Nowhere did it tell me that I am able to use ranged attacks, which I found by accident, and the way to execute it is not with one button/key, but by pressing up and attack, which is not intuitive and very annoying to use, sometimes I execute the move by accident, which wastes ammunition. I would rather use a single different button or key to execute that move. The game also does not tell you that you can block when you press down, which I found by accident too. I do not know what other hidden mechanics the game has that it is not telling me, but I know for sure I have no desire to find out. A game that does not tell you how to play is not a good game, and not worth my time.
Unplayable, for me at least. Game breaking bug where almost every action will cause me to jump backwards as if I had gotten hit, but take no damage, and get knocked down, where I have to mash buttons to fill that annoying bar up just so I can move, only to have it repeat again, and again, and again.
Really bad, do not purchase. The game is unreasonably difficult.
I've played less than an hour of this game so take my review as a grain of salt. I couldn't get past the first level. Being stunned by the hentai cat chick, mounded and essentially raped, is comical (in a dark way) the first few times it happens, but eventually it becomes tiresome.  The main issue is that the way out of the stun lock is to button mash the triggers of the gamepad, which can lead to being stun locked for several minutes given how difficult it is to raise the meter to maximum. And if you happen to not dodge or kill the enemy with seconds of recovering, you'll get stun locked again and have to repeat the process anew.  It's not a "get skillz bra" issue. It's that the recovery time is tediously long.  I'm not giving up on the game yet. I have 2 hours of game time before I have to refund, so I intend to give this another go, but if it's nothing more than this, then I'll be asking for my money back.  If the devs happen to read this, then my advice is to not make the recovery this physically difficult to achieve.
My opinion... Platformer: check Cute graphics: check Hack'n'Slash: check Innovative elements: uhm... check? Storyline: ...no storyline... Please add some intro, dialogue and context please T_T 
This is one huge missed oportunity. The main mechanic is a very annoying and repetitive mash button that will make you lose your patience in five minutes. The game has actually nice plataforming and animation but the terrible idea for the main mechanic ruins it completely. If was just a short qte every time it happens (and be certain it will happen a lot), sure you can give it a pass. But the way it is here is unbearable.
I think it was a bit overpriced for what it is.  I did end up using a cheat to get through it because the game is pretty unforgiving and there isn't any explanation of the controls at all. I mean, if you really want a game of this nature go for it for that.  It's not a good platformer though.
I enjoy challenging games like Cuphead for instance, but this game isn't very enjoyable unless you're in it for certain scenes. You have to learn the hard way when it comes to controls as there isn't a tutorial. Even on Easiest mode, it punishes the player way too much.
Can't fuck ghost girl. 0/10
Now, this is a good game, but by no means it feels finished. The pixel art is great, the CG is on an acceptable level, the gameplay itself flows well enough due to good animations on both the main character and telegraphed attacks from the enemies, although a little tutorial would be appreciated to show off the possible moves you can pull off and where your mana is and what your dust (...? I assume it's dust, but nevertheless, it's not important, it's basically just currency) does would greatly enhance the game, but by no means does this justify the price for only 3 levels. The 3 bosses in the game vary in difficulty from "pretty hard" for the first stage to "just spam the attack button" on the second stage, and while having a boss later on in the game be a pushover is not *completely inherently bad by itself*, it being 1/3 of the bosses in the game is. The currency is only used in the first stage, having no other usage other than to upgrade your sword and magic once. Nothing else. You might as well not have it in the second and third stages. The difficulty being pretty high is only due to the low amount of checkpoints during the stage, making getting to the spot you died at just kind of a trek since not any of the enemies or sections are extremely hard by themselves, but on a marathon they can make you run out of patience and die, forcing you to trek all the way again. The music is generic, but then again, this is a hentai game. I know the main purpose of a game like this is not really the gameplay itself, but when I will probably just be able to look up the animations online I feel like it needs more content to justify the price tag. In its current state, I wouldn't recommend buying this. Maybe on a sale, maybe if it gets updated in the future.
Small horror game with good atmosphere and large, diverse map for you to explore.  However the numerous bugs and simple minded enemies, quickly turn the game into one goofy, "scooby doo" episode. You'll get scare or two out of the game, but the rest of the game will be comedy. You can't do anything but laugh as you'll trigger 20th time the same scriped spooky sound effect+rain inside the house, watch zombies dance as they can't reach you and explore the map by falling through it.  At the moment I can't recommend the game as the bugs are game breaking, and did cut me off from last area of the game. This game needs a lot of polishing and bug fixing, before I would consider playing it again.  However, for a couple of bucks you'll do get hour and half of content. Explore an gloomy map, including very pretty mansion and have goofy fun with bugs and doing your best to work around them to reach the end, not a bad deal after all.
on 964 turbo cilp b has hidden i couldint find it for hours it just pretty hard i searched hard
This Car 2016 PORSCHE 911 Carrera S (991 I Can't Find In The Junkyard
No  This game consist of sitting and looking at the screen an being ready to press the next action you want to perform.   You cannot queue your actions.  Th planning element of the game is negated by this.      
Better than the first in a lot of ways. But argurably much more unforgiving compared to the last.
Generic horror garbage with a complete black screen intro for a stupid amount of time. Expect shitty jump scares Expect loud noises Expect something bad
Not good. At all
Basically not a game, just a couple stock sprites dotting a tiny map. No menus, no ennemies, no story, nothing.  Was basically a terrible way to spend $2, seriously i could have had a kit kat or something.
I love minigolf games, and don't have high standards, but there is a few subpar elements that kind of hurt the game.   * It's buggy. Randomly the mouse doesn't appear on the screen. Trust me it's not my mouse, the game just gets weird about it. * The easings of the ball motion feel strange. * It's a 3-Star mobile port. Not a deal breaker, but comes across cheap. * It's 4x3 resolution. Kind of weird considering most mobile is closer to 16:9. Guess they only had the one * No controller support and half baked keyboard support. You can exit, but you can't accept with the keyboard. There is no left-right or up down toggles for menu. Either would have been preferable to mouse play, even though aiming / power of shots is fairly confident. * No spin or advanced obstacle objects.  I was hoping to get a taste of that Kirby golf game feel, but this didn't quite cut it. If there is more complexity and challenge later on, I won't end up getting ther.
It's okay... This game could have come out 18 years ago and I would probably still have said "lt's okay..." Yes, it's retro, but nothing more. I didn't have fun and wasn't very impressed.
This game is for autistic people. Game is too gay and full of autism.
TLDR; game is new! Give the devs some time to work on it and sort things out, and also give constructive criticism and precise reviews on issues rather than commenting on personal preferences. As a content creator, it's more helpful that you're precise and word things appropriately, and try to keep bias out of reviews. (Downvote purely so devs see this faster, no clue where I can leave suggestions!)  It's okay, there are a TON of bugs that could be fixed though! I would upvote this if the bugs were fixed, but since I want devs to see this ASAP, I'm downvoting for now! There are quite a few bugs I've noticed after playing for a small amount of time just with Zombies. - If you hit space while you're on the ground and Zombies attack you, you get stuck in the ground. - If you fly down from a building and Zombies attack you, you continue to move until you manage to spam space enough. - The head will rotate the full 360, but it will glitch sometimes and make it so you can only look one direction until you, again, spam space enough. - The dragon's landing is incredibly slow, and you can't do anything until you're landed. Zombies can hit you while you're landing, as well. If they do so, you're glitched into the ground. - Clipping issues with the buildings. The maps are cool, but they don't fit with a dragon theme and sometimes you get stuck on the stupidest of things- for example, a roof top. Like...how...?  Those are mostly the issues I've noticed. I've not seen many other issues otherwise...but I think a lot more can be added or done with it! All the downvotes for how the game is unrealistic and boring are kinda lame, as they provide no real context to the game and don't make it easier for those wanting the game. The game is relatively new and I'm sure the devs are fixing and adding more, and I can't wait to see what else they've got! I've recommended the game a ton already, though only my boyfriend so far has played with me lmao. Regardless, he's agreed with me on those points, and he has his own issues I feel like I should address too with connectivity.  - Joining rooms is difficult if you're playing on any kind of laptop, and his internet may be bad, but he was able to join rooms beforehand perfectly fine. We're not sure what's up with that, but granted he was playing this for free on some random website.   I'd also like to point out that the website that is hosting this game is probably doing it illegally and it doesn't save your data, whatsoever. Not even saving the page saves the data. I recommend you just buy the game, Steam does allow refunds up to 2 hours after playing the game (not after buying, just straight up playing).
Don't get me wrong, dragons are cool and everything but this game is just so lacking. I love the animations and the dragon model (that's why I bought this), whoever done that gets a thumbs up. But everything else is not so good. the map is waaaaayyy too small. there's not much to do other than 4 different play styles. Pvp is fun but it gets boring super quickly, the zombie mode is quite silly (and boring). if not all of them are boring. It's basically worth a dollar that the game offers. I rate this a 1/10.
Bad Decisions were made not worth the 10 bucks I spent.
it's not fun
°I FEEL LIKE THESE UPVOTES ARE FAKE°  While the dragons are beautifully animated and the dragon model and skins are nice. the zombies are not, they are abominable polygons. the controls are terrible and the maps are worse. the maps are too small and they don't fit the dragon feel ( as they're basically a forgotten wasteland ). it's not worth the money unless you play for 1.5h and refund afterwards.    3.8/10  have fun - The Walu
Some random arena PvP game in the world of dragons. Just get 100 kills. Unfortunately if you are stuck on the ground the controls are too clunky to fly up.
I love the animations of the dragons, but the sounds are AWFUL. After 15 minutes my ears started to ring because of the chaotic soundeffects. Environment could be better: A wastetown doesn't fit the environment of a dragon; mountains or ruins of a medieval village are. The boundaries are shit: You can glitch through them and you won't able to get into the battlezone again. Worst of all are the zombies: Animations are extremely bad, they're laggy and their sounds are cringeworthy. I like the concept of getting new skins by slaughtering zombies and dragons, BUT COME ON, THE SOUNDS, ENVIRONMENTS AND GLITCHES SHOULD BE FIXED. After I bought it I saw on another website this game for FREE, so don't waste your money.
Are you really recycling the assets "from" Masked Shooters / Forces all the time?... Replaced the character with a dragon + changed the weapon to fire breath = new game?...  Yeah, 0.39€ but it's still a shame.
i bought this game because it was cheap. i didnt really have any expectations for it but i was suprised when the actual animations and gameplay werent too bad. i just hope the developers improve on this game and really make somthing out of it. it would be alot more enjoyable with better, bigger maps and more player control when on the ground. i would love to play this when or if this game gets improved. i hope this review helped!
Great game design,but too many bugs and the snail-like moving speed,make this game a garbgeee
lol, wtf is this?  boring, slow, dumb -- stop development.
the game is really laggy and how come medium graphics are 100 percent worse then high?
Don't buy it. It worked for a few days but then Steam did their thing and blocked the scenes from happening. Even if you check the box to view the NSFW stuff, you can't see it. Save your money until they follow HuniePop and make a way for it to be uncensored.
It didn't work
she licked my tennis ball
i do love the game but the pack won't work for me
nope.dont bother
Game DO NOT WORK correctly. After 20 minutes of gameplay you can not progress anymore. You spend more money on ammunition than you receive back from killing enemies. So after few missions you are out of money, out of gold with useless pistol. Not recommended before devs will fix it.  It looks like game was design for mobile (you can buy powerful items using diamonds) and this is bad port. Bad because you receive like 20 diamonds after 20 minutes of gameplay and items cost like 500 diamonds. You can not get more diamonds farming them - probably it was possible to buy them on mobile but it is not allowed on Steam because you pay for game itself.
Achievements dont count to the steam perfect game count for any of the keyhole spy games. Waste of time. Lots more reasons to not like this game but there are enough negative reviews to read to get the point. Im not giving this more time.
Brought this as part of a Bundle...  Artwork is pretty average. Falls down on game mechanics. Its match three but you have to match a lot of tiles to complete a puzzle. You can speed things up slightly by matching sets of four tiles but its still takes a while. The games overpriced for what it is.   All of which is pretty minor. The major irritation is the last Achievement click 3110 times to like each girl. That's poor design.   Can't recommend the game, its overpriced and requires way to much effort to complete.   
Pretty mediocre match 3 game. Artwork is lacklustre and i'd prefer if the characters started off fully drawn (and clothed) instead of as stick figures. The characters all look the same to me, even down to the nips! Also it's annoying how you can't turn off the auto hints when you're a bit stuck. Maybe pick it up if heavily discounted.
- Easy Match 3 - Not much of a game - it could use a point system or one-time use skills that mean something in the game - I've seen better erotic art in a casual game like this - I don't know what you get out of the slider puzzle game, but it's rather annoying. I don't care for it.
Basic tile matching game with average artwork. Has achievements and the artwork for them is pretty good or at least I like it.   Have got issues with the game. The screen is split into artwork and puzzle which means the puzzle is squeezed into half a screen, the icons are fussy so its painful to match stuff up. The next thing you hit is you've got to match a lot of tiles to unlock the picture. Took about forty minutes to finish eight pictures, maybe nine, which awards half the achievements. The rest are for clicking on a picture thousands of times and I'm not going to do that.   So a basic tile matching achievement clicker game is pretty much destroyed by a decision to add busy work to the thing.   Can't recommend it.
This is by far the worst game that I have ever played. There's no instructions, the gameplay is super slow, and there's no indication of what you're supposed to do at all. All it does is just count up by 1 every time that you make a move and expects you to just magically know what you're supposed to do. How anyone can enjoy it is beyond me. The whole game is stupid and ridiculous. Zero stars. Absolutely HORRIBLE game. It's not even worth any real money to me at all. It's the kind of game that you'd only play if you're purposely playing games that are complete garbage. I don't know how anyone can say that it's a great game. It's the stupidest game that I've ever played. The only half decent thing about it is the characters. Other than that, it's complete garbage.

Buggy garbage won't even install.
This exapansion does not work for me, there is a chance that you can download this DLC and that its contents won't be funcitonal at all. This nearly ruins the entire game for me.
Lies!  I bought this only for two new Unique Planets. I've beat the game 4 times after many hours since, .... no unique planets.  I want my money back.
I have no idea why I brought this... (looks at the workshop).   but is a coffee.. meh, so depends on if its worth a coffee to you to add alittle bit more stuff.
NO! bad SEGA! NO!  Step by step, chop chop, it's only cup of coffee my friend, chop chop How much are 50 pages of hand made graphics images in a comic book? How much are 400 pages of sience fiction novel on iTunes? How much for 1 page of quest line text + 2 planets and 6 ship modules? How much for this game if you chop it into pieces?  Do you even ask yourself questions about value of money or are you a braindead zombie?
Good concept idea for a Mario Party VR, but terrible execution. save your money.
Caveat Emptor!
Probably an asset flip. Definitely terrible.  https://youtu.be/Wwoazux4gfo
I really can't play this anymore until some of the issues are fixed.  Graphics style is very nice,  enemy/friendly ai is not bad, it runs well on my PC but it has a lot of things that need fixing.  It needs custom key bindings, better aiming (it's ridiculously floaty and feels like its designed for an ipad), better spawn rotation (enemies can spawn right in front of you), Weapons need to feel more punchy (bigger bangs and better reactions from the ai when you shoot them)  3/10 It would be a fun game if it weren't for these problems and a few glitches.
My vote its negative   Bads 1- bad mechanical 2-spawning in enemy base 3-bad player graphic   Goods  1-good weapons  2-zombie mode 3-flags at the time    
Shooting garbage. First of all. It's not released as early access game, so we have clear right to rate it as fully developed and finished title.  Despite it's made by one person it's still incredibly bad thinked game. First of all, you see only 3-4 cinematics on the screenshots. It's [b]NOT SINGLE PLAYER[/b] cartoonish II World War game. All screenshots looks like april fools made only to cheat you that the game offers nice world and locations. This game is simple bot shooter when you are trying to get more kills than enemy before tickets for your team reaches 0. THERE'S NO CAMPAIGN. That's false point in Steam description that forced me to report this game for false advertising. There are just maps where you have to shoot bots before they will shoot to many of your bots. Also, when player is killed tickets drops by 5, bots counts as 1. Now imagine that you are spawned around enemies which are spawning in the same position as you, killing you instantly 5 times in a row.You got an adventage in this pure shat massacre? Well, let me kill you 5 times in a row due to facked up spawn system, so you will stop thinking about victory.  Imagine situation where you have 300 tickets to win, your team lose 50 instantly at the start and another 50 because spawn system is one of the most fucked up I ever seen since years of testing games.  Weapons? Most of them are useless because they are more accurate when shooting from the hip rather than aiming! YES, SNIPER RIFLE is more accurate from the hip! I nearly pissed myself and nearly made yellow spot under the chair from  laughter. In addition to this garbage you get insane motion blur and mouse smoothing that you can't turn OFF! So the aiming looks like fighting in deep water, every move is smoothed so hard that you can't proper hit anything. Bots? Bots are far away from word called "stupid", they are light years from it, millenias of evolving before word "stupid". No matter how you aim, what you do, your team will always be much worse than enemy and you have to do everything to win. Bots mostly are looking at each other, sometimes even fighting using RPGs in close combat. Game looks simply like pure asset grab where author just put his logo and made some kind of bot wars.   I'm playing ~100 games or even more in a year and first time since months I've to say - author, please, don't make games anymore.
the powers of shazam are the saime powers and shazam j and the rest dont say the megik word wen they are transform You did not invest the powers and were the rest of the 7 deadly sins
This is a bad piece of software simply put. It is no where near worth the current price. It seems to be some sort of student's project, and it is a mystery that is has been made available for sale.
Overall the game looks cool, and it seems that if you really lay some time into it you could make something nice. But, the things you can do is very limited. I know the game only is in beta, and i hope theres comming more features in the future. An example that there could me added some more things to is when you go under the libary where you have all of the buildings primitives, vehicles and accessories it looks like theres alot of things to do, but as soon as you open the folder, there is nearly not anything inside. In the vehicle folder there is only one prop, and thats a boat. A goddamn boat, for real?  I would not prefer this, but i see, if youre new at animating ect. this would probably be a good way to learn something.  So overall: The game as it is right now is very boring. I hope it'll get some new updates with more props, and more features. If so, i'll maybe try it out again.
this should not even be out in this state.  its, as a bad comparison, for animation, what the windows movie maker is for any proper video editing. i understand that. very basic animation, but i felt massively let down even with that.  a) the controls are wonky as hell. b) theres NO variety in scenarios. WYSIWYG to the max.  c) the TTS voices arent even that great. d) you cant edit the given characters in anyway inside the tool. and by that i mean REAL editing, like, giving them own faces with a beard and all that. real distinctive features   it may be a nice idea. and if you wanna do real crappy short videos, like a channel introduction video for youtube, done by this, it might even be your thing.  but to be honest, i think, it should not be in early access, especially not for over 10 bucks.   i refunded in less than an hour and i MIGHT be willing to give it another look in one year. although, with the lackluster way its done, i don't see any elaborate version of it.
I REALLY wanted to thumbs up this title. :( While there are a lot of walking simulators out there, only a hand full of titles are directly aimed at relaxation. I would love to explore a new space, discover new areas, but find my personal hauntings as well. Find that perfect meditation spot and bookmark it for ready use. A place to be present and centered, wherever I may be. I can only hope!  Sadly, I cannot recommend this title at this time by my mentioned criteria (below) and on principle. I even made sure to take the time to try it on all of my systems to see what was design and what might have been system specific issues or simply defects:  ** Tested on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift w/motion, WMR (Samsung Odyssey) | 1060 through 1080 GPUs  Pros: * Wonderful concept even if not fully realized, and I feel like this HAS been implemented with some caring rather than a quick wrap cash grab.  * The environments are well crafted, and definitely have that "iconic spot" feel to them; That image in your head that embodies a special place, realized, on demand.  * Ran smoothly on all of my devices, feels moderately optimized.  Cons: * Price - this is NOT marketed as an Early Access game, therefore I must judge it by what is promised in the description vs what is actually delivered. It is almost STRESSFULLY full of "almost-there", as if the road was paved until the concrete ran out, stamped "DONE" and then left those final few yards to our imaginations. I could forgive quite a bit of my experience if I had some inkling of intent for fixing things up, or if this is in fact the GA release and relegated to bug fixes.  * Locomotion - Hello Teleport! When first using teleport as guided I was expecting a nice soft pulsating ball, or ethereal projection, gently gliding me to my destination on the breath of angels. What I got was, a very much no-transparency thick white (what I can only describe as) crosshair on the ground that joltingly appeared before me. It feels out of place.  * Locomotion Part Deaux - One above them all. Swimming... I love underwater adventures, but What it turned out to be, for me at least, was less a swimming experience and more of a "Drowning Simulator"! It starts fine, . Then... things turned dark. I was having to paddle uncomfortably fast to try and even stay afloat. I was a rock, destined for the bottom of the ocean and there I landed. After spastic attempts to "cruise" along blipping and bobbing through the water it REALLY ended up feeling disturbingly like what drowning might feel like.. No matter how hard I paddled I couldn't keep the surface of the water, and if I took a break for even a second the physics would drop me like a cement-shoe-laden gangster seeing his last few moments on this earth. Sadly it is not in me to withdraw... so I put on my brave face, and paddled my little heart out until back to shore.  * Tutorial - I am glad there is one! But unforutnately as quickly as it appeared, it is gone and you are left wanting. (same experience all 3 HMUs)  Summary: Would be a promising EA title, if it were EA. Marketed and priced as a GM product, however, all I can say is Caveat Emptor "let the buyer beware".   Note: I really do love their concept, and despite the sound of it, a lot of the implementation. So, I am going to eat the cost, and hope that this is a labor of love that will get the care and feeding needed to realize its potential.   I see it... Only so frustratingly... out... of... grasp.
6 minuets and 39p I will never get back.
No, I don't like it. The gameplay gets pretty annoying after just a few minutes. It uses the Unity game engine, with 350 MB of diskspace. Played on ubuntu linux 18.10 with keyboard and mouse.
The game lasts about 5 minutes, the graphics are garbage and the weapons dont even have recoil..... It is not worth the 39 cents, its too short and , that is why, i wouldnt recommend it!
good part but too difficult
This "Game" is worse than free flashgames from the early 2000's. Sorry but it's true. I would refund for my 50 cents but im just too lazy. -1/10
Below average artwork.   Its a sliding tile puzzle. The originals were numbered and fairly easy to do as you can imagine the solution and work towards it. In this game the puzzle is a badly drawn and poorly coloured picture with one blank piece. Which might work if you could get yourself to care about solving it, but frankly I couldn't.   Maybe with better Artwork you could get over the motivation issue, as is it seems most people buy the game and give up before solving a single puzzle. If that's what the developers were aiming for well done...  Can't see me completing a single puzzle was hoping for an achievement clicker and its not that.        
I saw 'no' for recommendation, but really its 'not yet', It's still in pre-release so there is time to fix the problems out there.  There do seem to be a few bits missing from the UI, no research countdown and no visual of the station primarily, and perhaps a bit less automation or universal availability in resource gathering would make it feel less of a idle tapping game. A degree of competition with other stations would add to the experience as well.
Not much to the game. Not very engaging.
Not much to get excited about - hopefully, subsequent upgrades/updates will result in improvements.  So far, just stuck on one of Jupiter's moons with not much to do.....hope I don't run out of resources by the next update!!  As it currently stands, I can not recommend this game to anyone until it becomes more playable.
I really liked the concept of this game, but the execution fell flat for me.  For context, I have a moderate amount of experience reverse engineering software and writing exploits on actual computers.  I have played a bunch of Zachtronics games, and enjoy them (especially TIS-100), as well as things like Pony Island, but Rogue Bit just didn't do it for me - it was too easy, and didn't make up for it through story. It was also rather short, but given the price I can't fault it too much for that.
I'd had this game on my wishlist for some time. After noticing it got a discount and reading lots of positive comments about it, I decided to buy it. I did enjoy learning interesting basic stuff about what bits and bytes are, etc. and for the first five minutes it was going smoothly, although nothing much was happening other than me reading a lot of informative text and moving along a simple maze. Then it suddenly became more complex and I could make no sense whatsoever of what was going on or what I was meant to do. Rogue Bit is more like an IT lesson than a game. If you are into programming and already know the basics, I'm sure you would find this game entertaining, but otherwise stay away from it.
Pros: The Steampunk theme works very well with the Hidden object genre. Animation and voice acting are fine. There is a Bonus level.  Cons: Hidden object scenes are not very challenging and very straight forward (hardly any variations like having to combine things). Minigames aren' t very challenging either (I usually have to skip at least 5 or so). This game is over in a jiffy. I am a rather slow player finishing most of the Artifex Mundi games in 4 to 5 hours, this one took me 3 hours for the main game and about 30 minutes for the bonus part. And I really took my time here, I even managed to get all collectibles in the first run. The senes each look very much the same. The bonus level feels redundant.  Considering this is a relatively new HOG by Artifex Mundi it' s rather disappointing.
If it`s on sale, it`s ok. Nothing special, typical artifex mundi game.  Why not recommended? The last achievement, finishing a HOP in under 20sec, is nearly impossible.
Way too easy, and too bland.  I love Artifex Mundi games, but I refunded this one.  Give it a pass.
The steam punk theme unfortunately doesn't make this a good HOG. The puzzles are the usual. The story is rather bland. The same goes for the music. Not one of the best titles.
Pros:  - Great graphics - Great concept. - But that's about it.  Cons: - The handling is absoulete garbage.  - Practice mode only has you following the lines, implement some sort of dialouge to help remember the route by heart. - Needs more added vehicles, including minivans as well as graphics to show your a taxi.  - In practice mode, if you don't get in your lane before the starting line, your vehicle flips.   All in all, I understand this game is an early access game, so hoping to see more improvements in the future. At this point in time, I would not recommend this game. It's overpriced for what it is at this point in time.  
Pros -   Intresting Idea Graphics are not bad  Cons - Rubbish Controls This is set in the England and we don't have that many crossroads Every Traffic Light is red so it gets boring Gets boring quickly Nice Selection of cars but needs things like taxi stickers and minivans and modern city cabs...  I know this is an early access games so I like the idea but some Improvements will make it 10x better...  Graphics REAL LIFE  Really Good <------------ Good Okayy Potato Minecraft Graphics  Controls BIEN Good Okay  Bad Really Bad <-------------  PC Power NASA PC Top Spec Mid Range Low end PC             <--------------- Potato           Toaster Microwave      Difficulty GOD Pro Average N00b           <---------- ur grandma can play this  Price Bill Gates Cannot afford this Expensive - wait for a sale Over Priced For what it is  <------------ Normal Fair Price Cheap AF  lol  
An interesting concept but the execution is extremely poor.  Car handling is an utter joke - worse than arcade. Just no feel at all. Can't configure the controls either.  
I do not like these songs
nooo.... thanks but no..... The lyrics somehow made me LMAO
its good music to be sure, I do like it well enough. fact is I really loved it the first few dozen hours I was playing norse. BUT, it does get old faster than you may expect, and once it does, the lyrics become extremely cringy. fact is that you can get better musical offerings in the same thematic vein from the ragnarok music mod. bands like danheim scratch the pagan itch with allot more success and production value. I really do wish steam had middling reviews for instances like this, because I feel I got my moneys worth but after a relatively short time I find myself skipping all the new songs. So its a reluctant no from me.
I had to change review to negative because this music is copyrighted unlike all other DLC music for CK2 so as i said the music is good but for game. Only one single in composition is good enough to be eligable on its own and in this case why is it included in CK2 and no warning about it or anything.   I love it so much great work. But it shouldn't be called metal bc metal is stupid but this music is awesome. Bought it even on play store. Really enjoy it. Lately don't llisten to music much since modern music is  plain bad but this one i can enjoy.
I bought this for its resemblence to Hitman Go. While it does resemble that game in appearance and mechanics, and it does try some new things, I wish it communicated with the player a little bit better. I think the developer probably didn't speak English, as even the menu is just a series of symbols you have to click on to figure out their purpose. I think this game was designed with a mobile interface in mind, and kinda wish I'd bought it on that platform.
I was going to recommend this at first but the game just got on my nerves too much to let it pass.   While the main gameplay is fully servicable as a puzzle game there is clearly not that much work put into it.   The sound design is dreadful. If you kill someone it's a explosion sound effect. How hard would it have been to make it a sword slash sound effect instead? Especially since it's the ONLY sound effect. Nothing else, opening doors, walking etc has no sound. This especially bad whit Gongs where you are supposed to use shurikan to distract guards. So you use the gong and then wonder if you actually did use it cause you have no ingame feedback.   Also there is only one music clip looping over and over again.   At the end the designer gave up completely and had no more japan themed moddles but white fucking blocks and lines at the floor. Nice polish. Especially since there was bambus like a level previously where the character could hide so why not use that instead?   Also the game is over in under an hour. So pretty garbage.
I feel this game has potential, and it is pretty fun to play so I'll do a bit of a detailed review. Scroll all the way to the bottom to read the detailed part.  Negative first: - Game resolution cannot be changed in-game; however, you can edit your registry to change the resolution manually: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DefaultCompany\Ninja Code. - While the game is minimalistic, this does not mean there should not be at least a checkbox to disable the background music. - There is a key bug where you can spam click tiles to skip turns, effectively breaking the game. - I decompiled the game and found it is using playmaker in production, along with default project settings. The developers didn't even bother to brand or copyright their game. - The icons on the main menu are quite confusing as to what they mean, though you can sort of guess. Cross to exit, file to load game, but why an envelope for a new game?  Positive icing on the cake: - I love how the game mechanics and turn by turn based actions work, and it fits well for the style. - There are some pretty cool pieces such as the bamboo and some pretty cool other things I will not spoil the game. - The lack of a tutorial is rather interesting and it didn't take long for me to get the hang of new things. The game just throws you 'into the fray', so to speak. - I won't say I love the background music, but I think it ties well into the simplistic nature of the game and sets the theme well. - The game has a defined theme set around ninjas and stealth and that's really cool.  Detailed:  I feel the game is enjoyable to play and challenging to figure it out, if you're not a hardcore puzzle solver like myself. Most of the levels are easy to play, but it feels like that's the way they are designed. There is no tutorial, as I mentioned and that's cool for this game in particular so it leaves you to figure things out.   I feel a bit frustrated when you have to click on exactly the tile you are wanting to navigate to and you can only move one tile at a time. This can get annoying when you've killed all the enemies on the level and you're going for the exit. The lack of an options menu or any basic UI to change core game settings is a bit annoying, but not a real hinderance. There is also this toon effect that blurs the edges of objects, and I feel that's a bit unnecessary.   Overall, I sort of enjoyed this game, but I don't feel it's worth the AUD$7 price tag, even considering the developers don't have a Unity licence, but can pay for playmaker and use it in production.   If the developers upgrade to a newer version of Unity, stop using playmaker, get rid of that ridiculous toon shader and at least add a basic set of options on the main menu, then I would rate this game positive.  Best of wishes to the developer and may you read this review and hopefully amend your game because it could be super awesome with a bit of polish.
Fairly short (it took me 36mn to finish).  Not very complicated, even in the last levels.  Some of the tricks are far from being intuitive (you can teleport into a white block). You can't turn the music off which prevents from listening to another music, especially as it is very repetitive. Disappointing overall.
Physical Exorcist isn't the worst game ever but there just isn't anything really worthwhile within it to bother buying and playing.   The game is very short, taking me only a hour to see pretty much everything it has to offer. Don't take this the wrong way, short games are by no means bad due simply to their length. Usually a game takes this route in an attempt to gain quality over quantity, but there just isn't much quality here.   There are some interesting ideas in the combat system, but none of it is required or even works some of the time (There is a special AOE skill that literally does no damage to any of the four enemies you encounter nor has any other effects). To succeed in this game, simply follow the age old "Spam ATK = Profit" formula. You can do other things but they either aren't worth doing or don't work.  The argument can be made that this is a story-driven game and that combat doesn't matter, which I would then question why combat is even in the game but I digress. As for said story, it's cliche and poorly written (The characters in-game even joke about the cliche story. Being self-aware doesn't excuse the flaws, Dev). Bullied kid commits suicide, becomes evil ghost, haunts bullies. Woah, truly visionary work. The poor writing is also largely due to the absolutely horrible localization. Localizing something is more than just simply translating text.    There are some funny moments, good art, and promising ideas but nothing really worth spending 2.99 on. I'd be interested in seeing what the Dev can do in the future with some more practice, time, and possibly a team but, as for this product, just spend your money on a bag of chips instead. You're not missing out on anything.
The only thing it has in common with PvZ is the playing field, as they want to compare themselves to PvZ I'll also tell you why this game's nowhere near that great game by referring to it.  It started out with a nice tutorial to give you a nice understanding of the game mechanics.  It didn't all of a sudden decide to throw in gigantic hordes on the first playing field.  It didn't make it hard to see where you planted the plant, this game has humanoids to "plant" but the feet is not what decides where you "plantt" it, you have to check if the square is illuminated. (making the placement something you need to focus on rather than being easy)  If anyone want to know how I can decide this is not up to snuff with very little time played I can tell you that I've spent a lot of hours with PvZ, enough time to survive a survival round long enough to basically only have supermutants - don't remember name, the buffed version of the blokes with the gimp on the back - when I finally died... (I've finished it X times, I love that bloody game, it's brilliant in it's simplicity, this game comparing itself to it is an atrocity...)
cant believe i paid for this .i must have been drunk because the mechanics of the game and flow and ill be polite here ......leave a lot to be desired... to the devs: how about making it easier to succeed at something instead of struggling to stay alive with just eating and buying medicine ?because chance alogirythm  is way off ive played for awhile a cant achieve alot.but none the less ill change my review if you produce a manual on how to do anything .it just seems to me that developers are just throwing shit up on steam under the ruse of calling it a game....
I really like this game, since it is refreshing. It's a shame because I am stuck on level 9. This game keeps crashing when I try to do ANYTHING. Like... anything...... I want to give it a thumbs up, but until the crashes get fixed, it will remain a thumbs down.
some kind of a joke
could be a good game but crashes after level 8 , developers needlessly put too much effort in memory protection and cheat engine doesnt works  so i will never be able to see the end.   i hope to change my review once the game is fixed
This game looked very promising and interesting, and even its price was appealing. Unfortunately it's made with a very confusing User Interface and without any way to actually understand what you need to do to progress in the game, even if the developers say it's very easy to understand, it's not.  Graphic could be better even for a low-budget indie production, as its sound effects. Can't really understand anything also because it's poorly translated in english. The most important thing the game tells you is not to use a pirate copy of it, which should not worry developers at all since the game is actually unplayable.  Save your dollar.
Pity there is no other language than Chinese. It was promising
Causes a terrible issue to system32 folder in Windows 10. Only the third boot will offer you the solution, but just don't risk it. DON'T EVEN BUY IT!
When i buy this i was sure it have coop online sad story thats only single player :( Huge potencial for great online game. Single player waste of cash better download copy from torrent.
As someone who loves Starlink (I also own it on the Switch), I cannot recommend it at it's current price.  I initially picked up Starlink on the Switch because I wanted the Arwing toy and I really wanted to play the Starfox missions. I instantly fell in love with the game, it feels great to play and the combat is really snappy and enjoyable. Character's have decent background stories and the voice acting is great and doesn't get annoying as you fly around saving the star system. It feels like a Saturday-morning cartoon from the 90s.  Starlink's core gameplay is this: you fly from planet to planet and push back the Legion (the bad guys), you do this by capturing cities, hiring outposts to join your cause or building your own outposts to defend the planet, remove the fog of war on the map or delivery resources at set intervals. There's a dynamic element to all this, because the Legion can launch attacks on any planet in the post game as you're trying to get 100%, it's nice because it keeps you on you toes without feeling annoying. However, the list of things to do are admittedly small and things can quickly feel repetitive especially since you repeat things on planets several times over and there's 7 planets to do them on. I enjoy the gameplay loop but I could easily see where others wouldn't.  When I found out that Starlink was getting a PC release I was REALLY excited because the Switch version ran at 30fps at 720p and would give me headaches within an hour or so of playing. The PC version runs flawlessly at 60+fps at 1080p, and there's an FOV setting you can adjust to make the camera a little further out. It's a fantastic port. However, when I found out that the game was going to retail for $130 for the game and all of the DLC thus far? I wasn't happy about it because the game DEFINITELY isn't worth that much.  The game has has been out since October of last year, but still gets a full price release on PC half a year later? Also, the DLC prices are absurd because the DLC doesn't net you any new missions, stories or things to do, you're ONLY getting new pilots, ships and weapons. Are they even that unique? No, it's basically all variations of things you've played with in the base/Deluxe edition. The second DLC being the price of a AAA game by itself is insane and having bought it twice, I recommend no one picks it up. The worst part is that the Switch exclusive Starfox DLC, which got you 3 new pilots, a new set of missions that were fully voice acted with their own cutscenes was only $12. Nothing about DLC Pack 2 justifies it's price.  Sad to say, don't buy Starlink unless you only get the Deluxe Edition (you'll be missing out on a lot with the Standard) or you get everything on sale. Don't buy this at full price like I did.
As it looks like there is currently no online coop which is a shame and for me and my buddy is not worth 40 euros Sorry Ubisoft 2019  So wie es aus sieht gibt es zu Zeit kein Online coop was echt schade ist und für mich und mein Kumpel keine 40 euro wert ist Sorry Ubisoft 2019
I'm having a lot of fun with this game - it's repetitive, like most Ubisoft titles, but I'm enjoying what I'm doing.  The problem, however, is that it's appallingly expensive.  Eighty dollars for a game from last year?  A hundred dollars' worth of DLC that amounts to two fairly small weapon, pilot, and ship packs?  Come on, Ubi.  Wait for a sale unless you're hellbent on playing No Man's Sky crossed with Far Cry.
Character DLCs locked to Nintendo Switch only. Terrible game too.
Same old problems persist throu years, unable to launch the game. FU U UBI
Great little game you made! A shame though it is unplayable with an azerty keyboard :/  Please add customizable controls!
So, I realise that I might be a dissenting voice when talking about this game. As a puzzle game, I will acknowledge that this game is good. It has some interesting mechanics, the puzzles are often very clever and the game has a theme that you don't really see anywhere else. There is much to like about this game, which is what makes me torn, because I ended up not liking this game much. Maybe I had too high expectations, but Hiding Spot in many ways represents missed potential for me. It's a rough stone where I expected to get a polished diamond and it's bloody frustrating.   But, let's go to specifics. First of all, I want to touch upon the lack of story. In most games, this might not be too much of a deal; especially puzzle games seems to cast that aspect of the medium away quite often. However, the theme that is chosen here makes Hiding Spot different. Having gameplay centered around a person who builds their own little fortress to get away from the world is intriguing and it will be what draws a lot of people to the game. It was the reason why I was so excited to play. To then do nothing with it, to only fill a number of floors with nameless levels that don't really mean anything? It makes the game feel empty. It makes the theme seem like a gimmick. It wouldn't have taken much to live up to the potential either, since the pieces are already there and could've been formed in a way that implied narrative. Instead, I have to conclude that it was an aspect ignored by the developer in this case, and it's a shame.  As for the gameplay, there are a few problems. Firstly, the game doesn't really make an effort to teach you anything. Now, I don't expect handholding, but there is a difference between that and having nothing at all. In many of the levels I got stuck on, it was simply a matter of me not knowing that X could do Y. This could be due to stupidity on my part, but there are also several things that you could do in reality that you can't do here - like lifting things, or moving tables when they're upside down. The game has its own logic, and not giving any information to the player regarding what that internal logic encompasses is simply padding, in my opinion. Much like with the moon logic of old adventure games, it's expected that you simply try some things and see if they stick, which is not exactly riviting gameplay for me.  To expand on this, the game simply isn't structured in a way that makes learning intuitive. There is no straight progression where you go from puzzle to puzzle, learning new mechanics, reinforcing them through expanded use and then exploring a new aspect of the mechanics you've learned. Instead, the game throws scenarios at you seemingly at random. As an example, you can solve one room by stacking chairs in a specific way. You go to the next room where there is a similar scenario, but instead of using what you've just learned, you're supposed to remember something you did six rooms ago and use [i]that[/i] knowledge instead. What this leads to in practice is you trying to do something that is doomed to fail because you're using the wrong perspective to solve the puzzle. It's annoying and in the end, it doesn't serve to make the player feel smart when they solve the puzzle - it makes them feel stupid for wasting time doing the wrong thing.   Another aspect of the mechanics that I very much disliked is the movement system. This is more subjective, however: moving from square to square is not unusual for these kinds of games. However, I found it extremely frustrating because the direction you're facing is so important in this game and you can't simply turn. This means, again, wasted time as you make mistakes based on the fact that you wanted to turn around but instead end up moving something completely. Entire puzzles are counting on this being a problem, which is frustrating since you might see what you need to do, but you have to wrestle the game's movement mechanics in order to do it. The "Undo button" thankfully makes this way less egregious, but my dislike of the system remained throughout the whole game.  In the end, I don't think that Hiding Spot is a bad game. However, I have way too many problems with this game to just let it rest. The fact is, this game could have been so much [b]better[/b] than this, and it's not even because of a lack of polish, like in many other games. It's simply because of neglect. And I have to say, in a market where more and more indie games are becoming better and better, I don't know if this is worth playing - over other games, that is. In of itself it's fine, but the tragedy is that I really thought that it would be great.   This is probably going to be unpopular, if it's noticed at all, but I don't think I would recommend this game. There are too many better games out there. But it's not a bad time, I enjoyed a lot of it and I don't regret playing it. Therefore, it's simply up to you to make the ultimate judgement call in this case.
Complete and unmitigated disaster.  I'll tell you right now why the developer put a hundred nasty smear shaders over the bloody screen: almost everything is stock assets.  Every level from every chapter uses the exact selfsame textures and props.  Attacks are wonky, the level design is a complete joke and the enemies can't do anything else than either shoot at you or walk at you single file to hit you.  I'd say the whole thing is a joke, but absolutely no living soul on the planet could laugh at anything so sad.
horrible game, horrible graphics, the scanlines effect hurts my eyes and the gameplay sucks. the plot is generic and preivsible. 90% of the game is either horribly executed or makes no sense... I'm afraid to admit the only "good" part of this game are the trailers images and promos. lmao.
Absolutely not. Do not do it.
Simply put, if you're interested in excrutiatingly difficult puzzle games with seemingly unforgiving time constraints, or rather tight time constraints, then this would be perfect for you, but otherwise, it is not worth $2.99. You're better off investing your money in the Room series of puzzle games
10 minutes into the game I seem to waste unnecessary time trying to actually make the pieces fit, even though I am in the right place, if you are not at a precise angle or distance the game just won't accept the pieces of the puzzle ...pity, looked like it could have been enjoyable. I don't recommend it.
Puzzles range from reasonable to "wtf" in complexity. The graphics are great, but controls are sketchy, awkward and blocky: You'll be unable to move a puzzle piece, then it will fly way passed what you were trying to accomplish - rendering certain puzzles to be downright maddening. Thus, the 'match the image on the left' puzzle with the 4 tiles is simply impossible to pass. The tiles spin wildly when moved, if at all.   I regret spending money on this one.
I feel like its more of a guessing game than a puzzle game. I also hate that there is a timer. Game play is not very smooth. Kinda wish I didnt spend money on it.
this game is impossible to pass. I will admit that I looked up a walkthrough to help me get passed a puzzle I could just not figure out just to realize this game was only a piece of crap that for some reason refused to let me complete a puzzle. I even inputted the correct combination but it would not take it leaving me stuck and unable to finish any thing else so until this game is actually playable I urge everyone to avoid this game
[h1]■■■■■□□□□□ 5 / 10[/h1]  Quest Room: Hanon is an escape room-type puzzle game. Right off the bat, you start with a 90 minute timer ticking down to 0 even as you review the controls. Solve all the puzzles before the timer runs out, or it's 'Game Over'. Tick, tock...  In a puzzle game where you remain completely stationary for its entire duration, all that there is to judge are the graphics, sound, controls and puzzle difficulty. So, if you're into Egyptian themes, you will surely be able to appreciate the visual aesthetics here. The sound is mostly fine as well; a subtle loop of ambient sounds plays in the background without ever getting too noticeable. However, should you reach the last 25 minutes, somewhat intensified breathing sounds start playing all the way until the timer runs out. It seems like an odd design choice to have this play continuously for 25 minutes and while it may be meant to create suspense, it just becomes an annoyance after the first couple of minutes.  The controls are pretty straightforward and can be reviewed at any time by clicking the big question mark icon (since there is no menu). Keep in mind, the timer does continue to tick down when you do this. Most actions are performed by left-clicking, you look around by using right-click, and at times you'll also need to press Ctrl to crouch/stand up (though this is oddly referred to as 'Align' in the controls). As you go along, however, some items and/or puzzles will require you to click and hold the LMB while dragging your mouse, in order to perform certain actions such as retrieving an item or turning a dial. This mechanic doesn't feel fully optimized and simply using left-click to pick up or rotate something would have been a much smoother approach. Even though this dragging mechanic is perhaps meant to add another minor dimension to the overall experience, it just feels tacked on and can actually get quite frustrating.  As for the puzzles, they range from fairly straightforward to 'please explain your logic'. When additional hints need to be posted on the Steam page because 90% of the players are stuck, it seems only fair to wonder whether these puzzles were properly thought out before being included. While it may be easy to explain some of them as 'you need to pay attention to details', there are plenty of details here yet very few logical connections between them. Yes, this is a puzzle game at its core, but if that's the justification for applying far-fetched logic, you have to consider the size (and determination) of the audience that will be interested in solving obtuse puzzles with a timer ticking down.  Even though Quest Room: Hanon is a bargain, and the Egyptian theme is a nice change of pace and scenery, it's just not much fun overall as a game. It's almost worth a passable recommendation but it just misses its mark too often on the things it tries to accomplish. Since it is the first entry in a series of three games, it can still go uphill for the series going forward. Hopefully, the developer will consider making the next parts a bit more user-friendly while sufficiently expanding on the in-game story, as a way of offering players an additional incentive to keep playing.
TL;DR: Buggy controls made this game unnecessarily frustrating to play.  I bought this game because I was hoping for an experience like The Room series of games, but was let down.   The controls are buggy and erratic, making puzzle pieces very difficult to manipulate -- something that seems like a necessary given in a puzzle game. More than one puzzle had parts that had to be spun didn't move until you made them overspin past the position you wanted. Puzzles should not be difficult because of jittery controls.   Also, the movement of the view is very limited. You are in a fixed camera position at the center of the room and can only toggle between high view and low view, rotating the view from the center point, and zooming in and out. What this means is that several puzzles must be viewed from an obscured, slanted perspective that makes it very difficult to figure out which areas of the room have parts that can be manipulated.  These things make it unnecessarily difficult to complete the puzzzles in a way not intended in this format of puzzle game. It would be like having a jigsaw puzzle game where the pieces randomly rotated every time you tried to connect them and you could only view the puzzle surface at a 35% angle.  Beyond that, there were puzzles where the solution didn't seem to have a clear indication of what the solution was without guessing (the nine rotating black circles puzzle is what I'm thinking of in particular). 
Very quickly got to a point where there was nothing left I could find to interact with. Nice graphics but overall essentially dull and frustrating. Once you get to a situation where there seems to be nothing that you can do, it's not enjoyable. It's fine when there are choices available. But when there is apparently no decision to be made it's just irritating. Having a time limit just makes it even more annoying, sorry! I simply don't like this game, it has tried my patience too far.
i was looking for a short, casual puzzle experience and was intrigued by the ancient Egyptian style. What i was met with was something that was both lackluster and buggy. trying to play through it a few times i encountered several bugs with the rotation of objects, they would get stuck and/or made some puzzles unsolvable, despite the fact that it appeared that i solved the puzzle correctly. There were a few puzzles which didn't really correlate to any clues in the enviornment, which took away from the experience. Unfortunately I cannot recoomend this game.
This game is not good. First the game when you get into it says it is a demo but you have to pay for it and no where does it say you are buying a demo.
The WORST Game of all time!!!!
Alright, Conczin, you win.  Again for those who don't wish to read 40 odd paragraphs of suggestions this is a summary of this game as it stands, Its an okay game, far better than many other out there, but falls into many traps that other fell into as well, Sounds sound too ... 'sharp' and can get annoying after a while, Graphics are pretty good, controls are odd to say the least. Im not saying its a bad game, so keep an eye on it ;)  In terms of the controls:  When you play a game like this (a 2D side scroller survival game) there are commonalities with controls, Normally the space bar is use for jumping, not "W". Also its more common to use "E" to interact with objects instead of clicking them. But those are small gripes I can live with, A more suitable option is to implement some form of key-binding option into the game. That lets people who play alot of these kinds of games (Like me) to use a control scheme they are familiar with.  Next, Tutorial and 'Shortcuts': Yes Tutorials are important, but there is more than one way to create a tutorial, think about how Minecraft or Terraria do their tutorials, since it appears thats what you're roughly aiming for with this game. Having a help key (F1) is really useful. However you have the ability to do somthing with it, try merging the crafting manual with the help key (F1), that'll clear the number of hotkeys to remeber. (If I may suggest it, check out, It'll give you some ideas to improve the tutorial for your style of game. No im saying you've done a bad job, but that you have room to make it better.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCPcn-Q5nKE  This will be expanded apon in a bit.
Release Act 2 I enjoy hiveswap freind sim but its a fucking cashgrab, yeah i know its really cheap to buy, but they're pumping it out really fucking quickly. Im starting to notice its just a cheep cashgrab people are gonna buy because "its only 79p". Some of the chapters have such a low fucking quality. its fucking dumb, ive stopped buying them because its a fucking cashgrab. 
Okay so I've been loving this game so far but Vol. 13 keeps giving me an error and not letting me play it at all, which is extremely bothersome and I don't really want to just skip past it.  heres what the notepad says   I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

Good concept, but i did think it is too much mechanic for my taste.
sadly not the game you're looking for. Extremely well designed and credible graphics but lacks that retention factor that keeps you coming back. sad to say that I wouldn't recommend.
Got Old Quick
Well at this point of the game, it feels like a bad early access version. Considering the price i would still say, that both, the playabillity and the price are not fit together. I love the concept behind it. I have to downvote this piece of software at the moment, but let's have a look in the near future. Let's watch this game in 3 month from now.  I don't want to downvote alone. I will give the developer some ideas how to make it better. I thjnk this way this review fits better for me and all can learn.  Here are my thoughts:  -WASD for map controll -A Bulldozer graphic instead of a green square to show clearly that you can destroy your buildings. - I choosed rockets. I had to build every production hall to see, that i have to build the large production building in order to start with the rocket business. A hint in the tutorial would be nice. - A deeper economy would be nice. Dont know how to write it down. - Routing buidlings together - Choose a storage, where the stuff is arriving - Choose from where the production building gets the materials - All buildings are unlocked at the start. instead of unlock all you have to do things, get some sales for the company - Negotiation with the employees - At the salary menu the bootom slider can not adjusted easily. Need a form to type in instead -Shortcuts for Timewarp: 1, 2, 3 Space etc. - If you sell a building, you get nothing in return. Make a 25-50% refund from the building - I cannot scale my marketing. 166 Employees can be assigned. Need more :) -U cannoit close  a company if you have more than one. Change that. - If your second company goes bankrupt the total game is over. Thats not fine :( Killed my 3 hour "not savegame" :( Change that please.  Okay this are just my 2 Cents :)  Have fun guys  Feel free to comment and write down your ideas for a better game. Maybe the developer will see it :)  o/
I'm not sure how this game is listed, but it should be under 'casual' or more aptly, 'childs play'. There's absolutely no challenge to it, even under the most difficult settings.   I actually like the game mechanics. I think it has potential and there's no bugs that I've noticed - but it's purely a sandbox or simulator game, offering no excitement or sense of accomplishment.   It's cheap, but not worth the money if you expect more than sandbox play.
Not Recommended.
It´s just not good enough, I don´t recommend buting this game. The controls are bad, resource management is awful, employee management is also awful, construction space is too short and you need to fill it with warehouses.
The game has potential to be a good tycoon game. But it has a couple annoying features: limited space to construct new buildings, annoying materials ordering system, no research queuing, no automatic production for a new design.   Also, every tycoon game needs stats - the more the better! Charts, graphs, financial details, more more more!
I love business sims, but this sucked big time.. For me not even worth the relatively low price
Had been waiting for this game for a while, and i love managment games like this, but this one died out pretty fast. From game breaking bugs to lack of content and becoming repetative after the first 10 - 20 minutes with no altercations. This is really a title you should avoid.  The content of the game is to manage resources.  Buildings = Staff, Storage and Production capability. The gameplay for the first 10 - 20 minutes is to build up the company, then the rest is to just order materials as a chore while you watch your company slowly grow.  The game lacks replayability and content to actually keep you interested and refreshing, the only difference being settings and what you research, some visuals too, but the game is exactly the same.  Game has a bug where time freezes and never starts again. Dev says its fixed, and is a bug on chinese systems, too bad im european with an english setup. Super easy to create this bug, and doesn't seem that the dev believes it is there anymore.  Sorry to say it, i love these type of games, but overall, i can't recommend it at all.  Note: The game breaking bug in itself isn't the reason alone for negative review.
Game has a bug in which everything freezes and is basically unplayable.
This game has some potential to it but it needs some work to make it a game that can be enjoyed.   1. The UI is not very friendly involves to much clicking menus and options in order to complete things. It would be great if they could add the basic materials to the top of the screen so i know can easily know how much materials i have in storage rather than clicking several menu options to get to them. it would also be great if you could type the amount of materials you wish to purchase not have a slider.  2. this game has no challenge to it. it just consist of ordering more, hiring more, marketing more, just do more of everything every couple secs and your money just goes up. with out even researching or adding a new product i easily got my company to be in the millions and then billions in mere mins after the initial set up. then you start a new company and just do the same thing.  (tip just buy the biggest factory, order the supplies you need for the first 3 of a product and then just auto make) so ive lost interest after about an hour of playing.  3. you can only sell a finish product... there is no point to smaller factories if you just get a bigger factory that can handle everything. you cant even sell the smaller products needed to make the finished product so no form of income until you get a final product made.   was really hoping there would be more of a supply and demand the need to make the lower products before you get to a final product. just feels more like and idle clicker game than a business tycoon game. plus side is its under 15$ so didnt really loss out but hope to see improvements made in the future.  
Its a good basic concept, but with much to improve. For example:   -no automated production progress -music thats not annoying -more depth to the game -higher capacities of the warehouses (my map was only warehouses for metal) -a solution that you can order raw materials automatically  Its a good concept but sad that it makes little to no difference wether I carefully design my products or just take the default  ones. Looking forward to new improvements.
Tried this game for a little while and even successfully produced a car and was profitable. The tedious nature of the process made me end the torture. To begin with, whatever new product you create you have to manually babysit the entire process for the first 10 units. Then, once you're done with those 10 units you can select to automate the process. Even then though you aren't finished with watching it. The automated process just means that it will automatically switch the production of that factory from the main product to the components of that product. It completely eliminates any way to have multiple smaller factories feeding a larger one. Instead, you set the product to auto and then spend more time watching your warehouse stock to see which raw material is going down fastest so that you can order more.   Of course watching your stock levels isn't easy either. The stock levels for items is hidden under a couple menus and then, even when you know what you need to order you run into another problem. The more you order the longer it takes for you to get it. So if your'e ordering because you're running low you're better off putting in multiple small orders instead of one larger order (which means lots of repetitive clicking). If that wasn't enough there isn't a way to automate ordering so you can't, for example, set a minimum amount and have it automatically ordered for you.  Unfortunately the same careless design has been slathered all across the game. Hiring employees is a pain. Keeping employees happy seems to be automatically done, unless you have an office that is too small or a lack of managers. Employees will randomly quit, but the message doesn't even tell you from where they are quitting so you always have to go check before trying to hire new ones. Marketing? Same thing, a drop down that isn't really explained (why do I need more brand recognition?) and more sliders.  If you're thinking that maybe the game is redeemed on the research side of things you would be wrong. Want to research more than a single item at a time? Couldn't find a way to do it. The whole process was driven by number of researchers which depended upon the item researching and a drop down menu to pick what you wanted to research next.  If all the annoyances weren't enough to turn you off from the game there seems to be very little simulation happening. I never saw a drop in the desire for the cars that my company produced, despite other entrants onto the market. There was no variability in supplies, no changing prices as the price of metal or plastic fluctuated, and not much impact for worker compensation.  Overall, I would stay away from the game unless it gets some major enhancements from the development team.
Let's be clear, first.  This isn't a game.  This is a visual novel in the strictest sense of the term: a story with graphics.   There are no choices, no secret characters, no branching routes.   There's a beginning, a bunch of porn, and an ending.  Given that, your mileage depends quite a bit on how much you enjoy that porn.  Not sure who the intended audience is here, but speaking as an unrepentant fujoshi, turns out it wasn't me.  The art was pretty, but heavily pixel-censored images killed the visual side, the squelching SFX were hilaaariously over the top, both traps were very obviously voiced by women and the constant variations on "MC's magic p*nis is turning me female!" / "now that I've tasted MC's magic c*m my existence centers around being his personal c*ck sleeve" was super, super tedious.  I could go the rest of my life without hearing the phrase "Ochin-chin miruku" again.   Again, YMMV.  If the above sounds like your thing, enjoy.
The other characters of this VN is great except for the main character Masato.  Best described as a spineless little nerdy whimp, all i kept saying throughout this thing was, "dude grow a pair."  The traps have more balls than him and it is very very annoying.  Please, don't create such weak and spineless main characters especially if we are the ones that are personifying them.  It is insulting.
Traps are godly. Art is good. Story is shit. Mishiro is cancer.
It's alright, but... "TO BE CONTINUED"? The heck is this? Uncool. I'm also a bit disappointed, as the game seemed to suggest there'd be a few choices to make and allowed multiple save slots to accommodate this.  Hint: Not a single choice was made throughout the entirety of this story.
Nobody told me this game would have TRAPS. What the f***???  [EDIT]:  The game is way too short for a visual novel. No choices to make, barely more than one page of CG used. Am impressed with the presence of Voice Acting. Too much blueballing. Sometimes very strange choices of sound FX.
Linear story.  Expensive.  Super ghey.
Get Baptized
I didn't see a single feminine 🅱️enis.
1-10 i give it a solid 1. Game is trash only 15 levels and if ur looking for just a lil bit of stratagy it not here. u have 3 units to choose from Axe Spear Bow. Just use the Axe guys you will beat the game in 8min. No content what so ever just a money Grab.
Meh... one enemy group. Inaccurate. I know it’s an indie but damn.
(Sorry for how long this will eventually get I just feel like the previous reviews are good for records of progression) Update 1.2:  Finally actually getting to editing this and... It's getting closer to a proper good play on some time you don't know what to do with game.  I don't really have any major complaints about any of it at this point. Nothing is really broken at this point far as I can tell.  Minor complaints are still there though. Though I'm sure they will be able to be properly addressed now.  Examples: 1. The SCP's are bland looking, though they do have some interesting bits 2. Maps are small and nothing to interact with 3. All of the health and ammo spawn on top of each other at their main spawn point 4. There's a kind of lag or multiple input problem with the jumping that can make you jump once more after hitting the spacebar a bunch  Improvements that can be made are plenty, of course, but some suggestions are: 1. A better spawn building design for the SCP's 2. A grenade of some kind added 3. Different levels on a map or area that could be unblocked/unlocked 4. Some text and a pause for the game with an option to leave after you die so you're not just thrown into another starting round 5. Giving the rock ball with tentacles the ability to climb 6. Have a animation of rolling or walking for the said rock ball thing  ======================================================================= Update 1.0: The new map is fairly decent and the replacement map improves on what it replaced ten fold.  However, with new maps comes with new map bugs and such. But instead of trying to describe what I've done I think I can just show off what I've done, mostly for the devs.  Map 4: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4zlte3csyjz2s04/2019-01-16_20-03-56.mp4?dl=0  Map 8: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ayyo2larw1g7el/2019-01-16_20-36-00.mp4?dl=0 afterwards I finished climbing the center looked down through the hole and proceeded to run back to the edge of the map and fall forever.  ======================================================================= Update 0.5: It's a definite improvement on everything that was a written problen from before so now I can get to the more nitpicky things at the end.  1. First off I can still get out of some the maps. Luckily it's just because you can wall run and jump on any surface that isn't a complete 90 degree angle. Otherwise they're much harder to leave now.  2. The second map on the list has some definite problems with rocks letting you jump onto the spawn buildingd thought. Makes it very easy to get out of the map that way and it's the only one that has rocks that flicker in and out of existence.  3. Three is more of a dissapoinment rather than a complaint but there are many trees that you can just walk through and it just... You know... Non-existent trees really.  4. The textures can get weird if you do the right thing and look a certain way but it doesn't pop up often and.... I only really encountered it while jumping up nearly vertical walls but it's getting put down just in case.  5. The previous maps are the same and still rather bland. While the A.I. can still be tricked but they also get caught on corners as well.  Suggestions- 1. Have the pick ups at a certain station so you can pick them up when you want.  2. Have an ammo cap so you can't just have thousands in excess so you have to think a little bit more on how to survive each round.  3. Maybe some definitive markings on the guns to make them stand out more and be a little more unique than they are right now.  4. Have the little rock tenticle monsters shoot out a rain of small projectile's so it looks like they actually hurt you rather than just pop and then you get hurt.  5. The ranged ones I think should have a small tweak on their short range so it has a small lasting effect to make getting close to them more threatening.  Though I feel like until some major improvements to the maps is done or they add the multiplayer or campaign I still can't really recommend the game right now as a single player survival game.  ======================================================================= First released: This is little more than a demo at the moment really. Literally bought it as soon as it came out  cause I like the idea of a SCP FPS and did everything available to do as of right now.  1. The only mode available in the game, survival, is difficult for the wrong reasons. Enemies are fast and catch up to you very quickly which is compounded by the fact the maps are so small. Also it's fairly easy to run them around by jumping off of things and sprinting away.  2. The gun is.... Sevicable and you can turn it into a automatic if you have a fast enough click.  3. The maps are bland and lifeless for the most part with only a few interesting bits here and there.  4. The enemies design is sound but the noise they make is like a metronome times how many enemies are alive at the moment, it can get annoying.  5. You can use your gun to jump out of the map and fall forever if you want, the gun jumping is actually pretty fun and you can use it to get on the higher points. How to actually do the gun jumping is shooting towards the ground and tapping space bar. Hitting R to reload constantly also means you can take off and really get some height, especially if you have a bunch of ammo.  6. The actual movement is pretty smooth and jumping from object to object is easy enough.  For what I'd like to change.... First of all more interesting map designs. They're very small and bland at the moment so actually playing the survival to get to higher rounds is... Not really fun but not exactly a chore.  Two would be messing around with how the survival mode works as a whole. The pick ups are for both ammo and health, which is something I don't personally like, plus they all spawn in the same place at the start of a round so you usually end up picking all of them up at the same time. The enemies are a little to fast and maybe tinkering with their health wouldn't hurt. Only one gun but it just came out so that can get a pass, especially since the in game news letter says they'll be adding another on the 10th.  A final gripe would be that there's no way to leave the game without alt tabbing in full screen.  So I can't recommend buying this at it's current price at the current time. Though I do sincerely hope that changes.  (Will edit this as the game updates)
For those who are looking to play this game in English, I’d advise against buying the game due to the poor translations.  The art of this game is pretty, and I was really looking forward to the release of the game hoping for a good story too, but unfortunately, I’ll have to give this a negative review because of the bad English translation. Most sentences are translated to a degree where you get a gist of what is being said, but the inconsistent quality has kept me from being able to fully enjoy the story as I’m constantly needing to re-read sentences to try and make sense of everything.  An example of the translation: "Around the dark blue sea has gradually become lighter blue, under the sunlight as if the gem is crystal clear, the ship accompanied by billowing white waves seems to be sailing in the sky."  The game is also lacking in settings, only dealing with the basic volume, normal and auto text speed, screen size and language. There is no skipping function available and with only 4 save slots, I can’t see it as being enough to save at all the choices either, which would make it a lengthy process in getting all the endings.  Overall, from what I’ve read so far, the story seems interesting and if you can read Chinese then I think this game would be interesting to pick up, but for English players I’d be against buying this game unless your prepared to read the story despite the translations.  Edit: The game has been updated with a skip function, pressing ctrl will now force skip through all the text.
don't know how you can release a game worse then atlas. 0/10
This game is so terrible and I am shocked that I fell for buying the game and i think it should be free to play and I still can not believe i wasted my time and money on this carp! >:(
This is a bad game 
Remember that this game is still in Early Access. They are busy fixing issues and bugs, but there are still a lot of them right now. Unless you're into supporting developers, I recommend putting off buying this game until later.
pretty much what you'd expect from an indie game the sound effects gave me headaches, it's just so bad
The game is a bit simplistic, and the tactical options are limited - stab, shoot, spell, slash, but it's diverting on the whole. Some of the scenarios in the campaign are poorly thought out - whose "brilliant" idea was it to have an unavoidable escort quest where the escorted character is constantly attacking you? And how many uncoordinated waves of creatures swarming toward you can you wade through?   It isn't a plotted out RPG with a lot of character personality, and no character customization to speak of. And there isn't really a plot, just a series of battles loosely strung together. On the whole, I wouldn't recommend it at this price point.
Cons: a) no character customizing b) "random" battles are not RANDOM c) not a true RPG i.e. my "hunter" shouldn't be able to wear plate mail d) No penalty at all for death or party wipe e) graphics, sound effects, voice overs are poor f) could go on forever.... do not buy this game if you are looking for a "true Rpg" g) even after the patches. simple math is still broken! Enemy "x" 17hps I hit for 11hps Enemy "x" still has more than 6hps h) when is 5% hit chance going to go away? i) Enemies end up with 1hp after certain attacks????  Please fix your game   Pros: none:
I hope new update to fixing bug ll come soon, i got force closed when i open this game.
It's not horribly bad but it's not too good either.
Scratching my head over some of these positive reviews; some are perhaps based on the nostalgia for older, turn-based, hex-map style titles that this gameplay invokes...instead of reality.   While the combat is enjoyable, this game is severely lacking in depth. Once you’ve played through the campaign mode, the only thing left to do is play the exact same battles again, in the same order. How can you make a game like this, with such fun strategic combat and not expand upon that with different game modes or more options? A skirmish mode? Player vs. Player? New campaigns? IT NEEDS SOMETHING MORE!  There are no meaningful choices to make: all the characters are pre-made, you have no choices when they level, and no abilities to train or choose from. Even all that time spent flipping through items at the “shop” (which is terribly cumbersome), and equipping new weapons and armor feels meaningless because they don’t even display on your party members; they will always look the same!   This feels more like an early access title that’s still in development than a finished product. Pass this by until it gets some updates. Not worth the asking price in its current state.
Unfortunately it's shallow and boring.
The good: - Nothing really.  The bad: - Sound is plain awkward. - Graphics are subpar. - Items do not have a visual representation. No customization whatsoever. - The game boasts about having an important and deep tactical aspect. In reality, you just hope you don't get one of those cheesy critical one shots. - Doesn't have any sort of gameplay in between matches, you don't even walk around anywhere, theres just a bunch of text in between fights that sort of tells a story and that's it.  This is my first negative review, I felt I was misled by store's description of a "realistic adventure". A real shame, specially because it doesn't look like it will ever be much more than what it is right now.
As you can see I didn't play very long - Tutorial and the first 3 Missions. So if I missed something awesome later in the game, the fault is mine and not the developers.  That said, why did I take the refund and give a thumbs down?  a) You can not make your own characters, only choose pre made ones. b) gameplay only feels ... meh. Graphics are mediocre, animations and sound feels somewhat off. c) got an epic axe from the shop for my dwarf, that didnt show up as graphic during combat as far as i can tell - possible that equipped items are not shown on your pawns at all (but I might be wrong here, since I only got a single item, said axe) d) "campaign" is just some text before the fight, no choices or anything. e) feels like an early access title, but isnt. So I will not stick around to see if things get improved.  As always, take a look for yourself, if you think this game might be for you! 
It is cheap and so shallow not much to enjoy in short I didnt like it
Cannot play this at all. Starts and automatically goes non-responsive. Waited 10 minutes before manually forcing it to close via task manager. Tried a second time to make sure it wasn't just a one time thing with the same results. This game is trash. Don't waste your time or money.
Not My Day is simply an Asset flip of [url=https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/cornfields ]Cornfields[/url] where you avoid a guy in his underwear for 15 minutes.  I regret to have bought 3 of Evil Game Studios/Electrostalin Entertainment games in the Otaku Bundle 36. The developer revoked keys on Jan 1, 2019 for all 3 games stating he was not paid.  However, the bundle did not end until Dec 26, 2018.   The contract states payment will be given 30 days after the sale period is over: https://ibb.co/NpNdVHm The developer has begun hardcore suppression by deleting comments and topics about the matter to avoid any resolution.  Luckily, the main discussion was archived, as well as his initial announcement: https://web.archive.org/web/20190103185338/https://steamcommunity.com/app/822650/discussions/0/1742229167228467323 https://web.archive.org/web/20190103185408/https://steamcommunity.com/app/822650/allnews/ Steam Gifts discussion: https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/P0ati/electro-stalin-entertainment-revoking-keys-to-3-of-their-games-otaku-bundle  Coincidentally, the dev’s bundle of all 3 games has gone on sale for 90% at the same time this entire mass cleanup has occurred in an attempt to get customers to re-buy the game a second time through Steam.   Please do not support this developer.  I will be refunding the bundle as it is fraud and very low quality.
Played for 11 minutes and got bored.. The graphics are amazing but everything else is kind of low and basic so i cant reall reccomend at this time.
Most scariest enemy i've ever encountered in a horror game.  Can't thumb it up though because it took me 3 restarts to get the game to launch and after that i've had to click 10 times on the options button, just to find out there is no way to change the insanely high default sensitivty in this game.
You get dropped into a field with no clue of what the objective is. This game I feel could've had promise, maybe it will improve upon itself further down the road even, I'm doubtful though. Even just a couple minutes of playing it was enough to turn me away. It has beautiful graphics thanks to the unreal engine but sadly graphics isn't what makes a game to me.   Issues: - Ability to click flashlight in cutscene when you get captured - Sound isn't realistic (It just plays as if it's coming out of your player's head) - Person chasing you doesn't have any sound effects until he is right next to you and even then you have to look around because he sounds like he's on top of you not behind or beside you. - Flashlight doesn't have much of a range and seems to just light up the objects in front of you rather than continue to illuminate farther objects.  Overall I know these issues are easy to fix, I have experience with the unreal engine, this makes it feel like it was lazily put together in a day then put on steam for the intent of making a few bucks. I would not reccomened buying this game in its current state and I hope it gets better over time.
This game is too early in development for it to be released. As a concept the idea of selling your own guns and such is intersting, almost like a more fleshed out HPAWS or gave development game. However that is the only good thing about the game, it's concept. The controls are awful, youre only shown how to use the OCULUS CONTROLS (take note everyone who bought the game on the grounds it says it's vive compatible) and by shown I mean a .jpeg image is put in front of you and with the label "Not all controls work" or somthing to that effect which begs the question of why theyre even there in the first place. I can only judge the vive controls as its the platform I play the game on but the controls are awful. The locomotion rendered me unable to figure out how to press buttons pr interact with things in the game and the teleporting uses the touch pad on the right hand controller which is also used for selecting, so you had better hope you get lucky when trying to simply press a simple button. In the 15 minutes I spent standing idle waiting for a customer to appear in my shop after seting up my equipment nobody arrived however i was given plentry of time to notice some basic errors that prove the game is really just past conception in the development cycle. Things such as "Expirience" being on the computer screen rather than experience or using an obvious model of an MP7 as an "Uzi".  Overall the game has a nice premise behind it and I really hope the developers workm hard on this one because I can see it becoming a great game in the future. Until then however, I'll be asking my money back.
Controls are horrible Could very well be the worst VR game I've ever played.
The vive controls are absolutely terrible would not recommend for vive users till there fixed
I love management and tycoon games. I bought an oculuus and saw that I could play a management game in VR. Although, I'm unable to play this game as whenever i try to buy something in the menu I just end up moving around my shop. I looked around the controls and was unable to figure anything out. Please help
The game lacks it really does. I was excited for this because the trailer was really well made and got me hooked into the idea of a vr hole in the wall.  Reasons: -the graphics just don't look right  -the hands are not aligned with the controller the way a average vr game would ( it's not set up right ) it's like they took final IK and just smacked in the VRIK prefab.  - the feet set up likes to appear far in front of you NO MATTER WHAT, when it should just appear under your cameras position.  - the game lacks audio/sound effect, it's just obnoxious music and sound when you pass or fail a hole. it needs some sort of announcer.  -there is very little introduction you are just thrown in which I would be stumped without the trailer.  - in my first round i saw the same hole multiple times, how hard can it be to make a few more holes? you could make those pretty easily with solidworks  - the buttons on the right when you enter the game ARE NOT BUTTONS they just glow when you put your pointer over it for no reason and have two game modes shown, idk why at all but when you find and hit the play button THERE ARE THE REAL BUTTONS BUT OH WAIT 3 GAME MODES NOW!          I really wanted to like this game i had it on my wish list for so long now, but with only a few minutes i knew this game was extremely flawed and unpolished, please put it in early access or re-work it. because I actually think i could make my own version of the one that is here now, it's minimum effort.   I'm requesting a refund, I'm sorry. i'f this game gets a make over i'd love to try it again because the idea is amazing but the execution was not.  
This game is NOT worth even 50 cents. The game is NOT finished. There are countless bugs, and even the core mechanics are broken. This hardly constitutes as a game, and is more of just a waste of time.
My god. This game. Is so, DULL. The Tower Defense aspect is about as strategic as an idle game, but at least in idle games you're able to improve your lot easily at the beginning before it goes into hard mode. Here? There is NO reward for killing enemies. Your ability to gain money is based entirely on a poker hand, which wouldn't be so bad except ONE PAIRS ARE NOT ALLOWED. There's an option called Jacks Or Better, except the game never explains what that is.  Basically, I paid 50 cents for this game and it's 50 cents too many.
I had high hopes for this game - the poker twist on a tower defense is such a fun concept. However, the game feels extremely incomplete. No UI or tooltips. I'm left with a lot of questions. Is upgrading a tower is better than using multiples lvl 1 towers? What does a purple tower with the lightning bolt actually do?  In addition, the pure luck element doesn't work well - it is extremely frustrating (and boring) when you go 5-10 turns in a row without so much as a winning pair.
I can't believe that this game was delayed so much and produced such a BORING game. The poker aspect is sooo simplistic...the game itself is very basic and bland..it is not even worth 50 cents...this is coming from someone who will pay 50-100 dollars per game if it is a solid game.
Has anyone else with the same problem received their CD Key? Happened before to me with another pack (Dragon) and it took me weeks to get this resolved, begging for the support teams to get this fixed. Just purchased another pack (Ogrest) from another account and it works fine.
Account name: riktu​s1​ Invoice: 1599243051797568677		 Date issued: 27 Jan, 2019 @ 8:01pm PST		 Payment method: Steam Wallet  Come on guys clearly everyone is having issues with this purchase and you are not doing anything to fix it.
I didn' receive any thing yet.. Its been 3 day. Whats the problem
Hey, i bought this product some time ago and i still didn't get anything. Please fix this and give me what i am supposed to get with this DLC.
how to active this ?  almost 1 day, and i still dont receive the item.
Got this for $0.55 cents, and still going to request a refund.  Right off the bat, the interface looks like early access, when loading a level, the game will freeze for a couple seconds and then load. First time it happened, I pressed ESC and guess what, it sent me back to the menu with no warning, making me have to back to the load screen :)  The graphics are basic Unreal Engine 4, so of course it will look somewhat pretty when used in it's basic settings. The gameplay could have been a fun, sandbox type of game, but the main objective is to collect moneybags in this HUGE open-world... except that open world is emptier than middle-tier iPhone games.  As people have said, no sniping and it's called Gangsta Sniper. Suck it.  EDIT: I had to let the game run for another 2 minutes to allow me to post my review. Dear Steam, if people are posting negative reviews when they haven't played even 5 minutes of it, they're either trolling or the game is bad. Steam is dead.
Not a single sniper in this game.
Haha what a mess
who the fuck thought this was ok to greenlight
STUPPPPPPPPID
did not install for some reason
The game is well put together and is in general good, however it crashes alot on my pc so be careful.
This game might be good.  Who knows?  The AI is NOT FUN to play against, it's clearly a multiplayer game.  But the multiplayer doesn't work (See thread here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/951670/discussions/0/1679190184076789192/), and the developer seems to have stopped trying to fix it.  Refund it immediately if the multiplayer doesn't work.
Risk like game...  Im not a big fan of Risk. While there are some cool ideas at work here i found the game to be quite dull
This game isn't ready for release yet. I'm all about early access and have several games that are still in early access. But this game was sold as a full game out of early access, but the game still has LOTS of errors (even basic ones like mixing up the sides or reporting where your secret agents are to the other player making them useless).   To his credit, the developer is working hard to fix these issues, but that's what early access is for. Not "completed titles" like this.  If the game fixes the issues and gets things working as they should, I will change my review. But for now, it's time to refund and wait 6 months or so and see what the game becomes.
Excellent concept, awful execution. Mutiplayer dosnt work, that was why I bought it. Might revisit it in the future if they fix it.
The game is still very young, the Ai is hard, its a good strategy game for multiplayer, but its hard seeing to play this game on singleplayer, as the ai will literally bully you into ending it in nuclear war, of course you can back down, but you'll lose loyalty. I can see this becoming a hit in Multiplayer, but for now. Its a no for me
I really wanted to enjoy this game.  I played Balance of Power a few years ago and loved it.  The only downside was that it was so short.  So I was really excited when I saw this game.  I like the art style a lot, and it's a lot easier to get around than Balance of Power ever was.  But I just can't get into it.  It feels like a step backwards from the 30 year old game that inspired it.  Resources, armies, and actions all feel so game-y and simplified.  30 years ago I could specify the exact amount of foreign aid I wanted to send, the number of troops I wanted to send, and so on.  Nations acted on their own and independently.  You didn't get influence points for arbitrarily having a certain number of countries on your side.  Why does getting that one last country in a region have such a disproportionate boost?    Most frustrating of all is that the AI seems to entirely lack the sense of fairness that it did in BoP.  The Soviets invade someone in my sphere of influence, they'll refuse to back down, but if I try the same thing, they'll also refuse to back down.  Do they have a death wish?  It seems like I can't get past the first few turns without either being browbeaten into abandoning my allies or ending the game.  There seems to be no spheres of influence, the AI just considers everything fair game and seems to know that I value my time and energy more than it does.  And on the topic of ending the game, I'm really surprised that anything inspired by Balance of Power actually portrayed a nuclear war.  What happened to not rewarding failure?
nuke shit is so stupid you can never lose or win
I liked this game pretty much. The only issue is that because nukes are always an option there is really no reason if you are losing the game to stick with it. If I was playing multiplayer and I was surely going to win the other person would just make sure we both lose. I get thats a part of the cold war vibes, I just couldn't enjoy that part. I really liked the game though. Great Concept. I'm sure someone else would not care at all or maybe I just am not playing the game right. Someone will love this game. just not going to be me.
This game looks pretty fun. I was looking to get into it with my friend but I couldn't connect to the game! I've never had this problem with other games on steam. I looked on their discussion board where they offered tips and they said I had to change my router. I'm not recommending this game until multiplayer is fixed. Hopefully that will get the developers to fix it.
Multiplayer doesn't work at all, and the instructions on troubleshooting it are just a link to a webpage that have complex instructions, the AI is also unpredictable in that nuclear war can happen randomly, it's a fun game but multiplayer and the AI need to be fixed before I reccomend it
This game was a close one for me but there are a couple reasons why im going to refund it.  1. This game's content is very repetitive and the two sides don't feel any different. 2. The AI seems to do the same play every game and follows the repetitive part. 3. The other side seems to never back down on the default difficulty and has a twitchy finger when it comes to nukes. 4. The "space race" doesn't do much when achieved  There are some aspects that are enjoyable about the game.  1. The artwork and creativity of the characters is nice for every different country, since it personifies the different countries. 2. It is a strategy game that is heavy on diplomacy rather than brute force  Additionally there are some complaints i have with it.  1. Even though i got it on a discount (it was $10.00) this game isn't worth enough and even $5.00 might be too much. 2. All the different options to take a country feel the exact same, and there needs to be more mechanics.  If the game goes on a major sale, and has some updates (it doesn't seem like it will) it might be purchasable again. Despite it being "finished" the game feel lackluster.
Unrealistic and possibly unbalanced. No game is a perfect simulation of real life of course but there needs to be good amount of paralels to real worlds for it to be enjoyable, Could one of the belligerent of cold war invade Burma and India at the same time without taking any kind of relation penalty with other nations in the real world? And if you try to protest without plunging the world into a nuclear war, instead of being regarded as the champion of the opressed people you lose influence over half of the world because you backed down just before the nukes were launched.  The reverse is the same, You can't even station troops in Warsaw pact countries without united states starting a nuclear war.     These mechanics could be balanced. I wouldn't know because it makes so little sense how they work it's like paddling against the current trying to learn them and it ruins my immersion. So I refuse to play it more.  Also the interface could use a lot of work. Buttons disapear and reappear to indicate you if you can or can not do an action. If you can't afford to do the space missions there isn't any gui at all when you click on your country. Why not just keep all buttons and show tooltips when hovered to indicate why you can't do them.  It pains me to thumbs down the first Godot engine game I see on steam. But the base work for the game is there I'm sure you polish it!
US invade china, and USSR invade japan?  there should be more limitation on invasion like no invasion of NATO or Warsaw , plus Japan, N/S Korea ,Australia and even Cuba and make China a very difficult target to invade, give her 7 troops  This game's Ai is confusing, as US, i deploy troops in Japan and this trigger nuclear war, this kind of nonsense behavior is a headache to me.  there also should be an option to negotiate with superpower to solve the crisis, like what US and USSR did during Cuban missile crisis. in this game however, you have to choose between losing unacceptable amount of influence or nuclear war.  it's a good small strategy game, but if you are looking for more historical accuracy like me, this game is not recommanded.
Not enough legibility on the vacant puzzles. In the space theme - selected images are too complicated for 800 pcs.  Very important: for broadcasting in the "indie games" mode, there is not enough screen mode 1024x768 and others. And also there is no memorization of the custom size of the window, at which there was an exit from the game.
It's not that the game isn't worth $7, but the game really isn't worth the time to boot it up and play it. It's like playing mini golf more than golf, but imagine having to hit the ball over a wall the size of a 2 story building, or land it on a 10 square meter platform in the middle of a pond, except the platform is convex, so that the ball rolls off.
i d ont like the wasy  the game   works
This game MIGHT have been good IF:   *It lasted longer than 10 minutes.  *It had some kind of interactivity / save / loading / ect   Honestly, if you want to see this type of material....just buy some adult graphic novels.
ugh, this is what happens when steam removes any and all restrictions on pornography and graphic content from their storefront..  As for being a video game, this isn't one.. it's a really well drawn pornographic fully voiced visual novel....  Hard core girl on girl relations.. and full on drawn sex scenes.   The story is the type of thing I'd expect from the mind of a late teen who wants to make a splash..  It's hard to recomment this game as it's not really a game, unless you consider hitting the arrow key to the left with one hand while you move your joystick around with the other..   I'm not really sure what kind of place this type of item has on steam..  While it was well drawn, and the storyline wasn't the worst thing I've seen in a visual novel, this game was quite a bit misogynistic.    I'd fully recommend waiting until it's on sale for like .89 cent to pick it up..  Aside from the content issues, it was also very short, in fact the game will last you about 6 minutes..   Will not recommend this game for it's current price and content level..
its a vioced comic book... i thought there would be more to it.
Ok. Well the screen shots look bad but  It's actually worse than that. I feel like almost no effort went into this. It looks stiff and just isn't that fun.   But if you go to the Developer/Publisher page of games, it'll all add up. I don't really need my dollar back so I'll just leave this as the only review.
So right now this is a super Alpha game with just a couple of places to visit (apartment, jobs and a convenience store) and you have to jump to get over the curbs. The camera movement is really weird (mouse moves tilt your head more than turning it) but the developer is pretty into it and it has some good potential as a 3D life simulator. Probably wont be much to speak of until Q2 2019 but if you like voxel games and life sims it'll probably be good someday. I'll keep it instead of returning just to support the makers and will check back often for updates. I'm going with 'Recommended' because I've seen much, much worse in an alpha game and good developer interest.  EDIT: Already seems like a crappy moneygrab abandonware. No updates or posts since launch.
Not a hard game. Speed boost on floor is a good idea. But i feel game machine and hitbox are too bad, especially the wall jump. You can find skips here and there in some levels. Some other levels are really boring. Less designed on speedrunning considered. Just force you waiting. Too many levels and feel most are the same, not worth the price.
Definitely the worst Choice of Games game I had the misfortune to play/read yet, and I've experienced many of them. The plot is paper thin, the choices don't matter because you always succeed no matter what or other characters will tell you 'no' and decide for you, the characters are dull as dishwater, and I even saw a few grammatical errors. How this was nominated for a Nebula award, I will never understand.
First thing to say: I'm a really appassionate reader of this kind of fictions. I say reader because from what I've seen so far the CoG and Hosted games in comparison with other games companies are very limited in their gaming experience to the ability of the single writer and the story he or she (or any pronouns they like to use) want to tell and to The Choicescript Engine that from my perspective have so much unseen potential that even if some stories aren't really great is an experience i like to come back to. Because It is fun to see with each "game" (I think at them more like movie scripts at best and some I've seen are pretty shitty B-movie qualities to be honest) how different writers try to convey their story, some of them have a good "base" material, put together a interesting world and create good quality characters the player is involved with and generally give the player the illusion of changing the story (pretty much for me this illusion is good based on how many endings there is to the story and importantly how you can reach them) the more skilled writers I've seen even add "mechanics" that make their games memorable.  Unfortunately This "game" isn't one of them.  With "The Martian Job" we have one of the CoG games I like to call - "The Pointless Big Dilemmas" (To mention the other  games I see in this category are: Congresswolf and Rent-A-Vice) They generally suffer of weak stories hidden by a good marketing campaign that try to sell what "in-game" is just a little part of the story, not even the main focus:  The story here "should" be about a generic named and "not more than" defined from pronouns character with a thief skill past There is no clear meaning behind the name of the stats: Like "Face" or "Wheels" (that I "guess" means "Charm" and "Reflexes" but I'm not really sure) but to be fair the author try to suggest what you need in the choice given (like "doing this should be the smart thing to do" meaning this choice use the "Genius" skill) from what I've seen there is 2 approaches to this game: the smart\tech kind and the brute force kind. So this guy\girl\thing protagonist find himself on a bad situation (no job, no friends and evicted from home) and is recruited as Vault breaker by a old fellow thief to make the Heist of the millenium: Rob A casino on Mars. that is cool right?  Well after meeting your team characters: I mean they are 5 cool and different fellas BUT in terms of "choices" about them you have little to nothing to share aside that you have the task to open the vault. To make it clear The Game don't provvide a true "Romance" mechanic and the interactions here are pretty much limited on "how much you liked this character" from the FIRST meeting as the Game openly ask you "Do you like him\her\they?" this single question define your relationship with that character for the whole story. No possible changes whatsoever later. But all this excitment of the heist with each going on Mars, separate under "cover" jobs (not choice you're a bartender) waiting to gather information and make a plan is short lived. Because The "plan" go in action too quickly.  Don't take me wrong the game is not badly written: if you like scenery of Mars and the main character trying to feel attachment to a planet it never went before then after few days of cover job, serving drinks hears about the struggle between miners and the company for who they work for, the main character suddendly feel like he\she\it\they should take action and rob the Casino no more for the money but because he suddendly despite a guy he never meet before (despite the fact you meet later a person that DID betrayed you and don't do 1 thing about it) and the game prompt the player the only question that seems to care about: "Could I join the rebellion?" or "Could I join the corporation?" SEVERAL times. I just say "Game" don't shove your pile of pointless dilemma on me.   The Truth is in fact that this whole story is around the rights of people to live on mars without be under the government of the Company that pay them. There is this underclass "the Miners" that live like rats but don't want to go away from the red planet because reasons (seems earth is worst place ever) but never ask for syndicate or better conditions. This Miners instead take proud saying "only the tough bitches could live here" ad feel like they should be "martians" and live on the only settlement with Oxygen on the whole planet without be under surveilance of the guys that for obvious profit reason build that same settlement and supply the air that let them live there. The Miner leader really think the bartender who served his\her\their last drink should take this job of helping them win this Rebellion and For the whole game I try to say: I just want to rob the casino. And if that is the case (this big branch of Rebellion story seems to wait behind a corner, with the hope you player finally change idea and let her out but as she ask if you "really" want go and be a robber and you player just pointless click the same choice over and over "YES", it goes behind the corner and let you continue your "side job" heist) it turns out however: The Robbery is pretty short: 2 tryes, you're In, whohoo\celebration, get rich, en..Want to join the rebels? WTF GAME!  In short: Not badly Written but the whole heist/thief setting is deceiving and for me at least the whole Miners vs Corporation situation is pointless. Voted 5/10
The good thing about this game was that each datable character had an interesting and distinct personality.  The main issue was that the conflict was forced and didn't make sense. E.g.:  [list]    [*]"you feel like you should have intervened with in these arguing homeless people" no, I really don't.    [*]"you should have stopped to help this woman" no, I shouldn't have. The police were already dealing with her.    [*]"you feel it's premature to meet Ray's friends" why would that be premature? It's not intimate at all.    [*]"it says something about you that you 'let yourself be chatted up' while on a date" except that me and Kaysha literally just had a completely casual, platonic, very brief conversation and didn't even exchange contact info. [/list]  There was a lot of unnecessary conflict over meeting Kaysha in general, bringing her up over and over, despite that I expressed no interest in her and she clearly wasn't a threat to my relationship with Ray. The author forced my character to not like Ray's friends, despite that they were perfectly fine (the options when he asked me about them were either pretend to like them or confess that I don't like them). The author forced my character to be mad at Ray for his cutting the date early after his call with his dad (all the options were either fake being happy or be angry).  Generally there was a lot of overreacting to the most petty things and making up imaginary conflict over nothing. [list]    [*]"Oh, no! He's looking at you like he wants to have sex! your prospect for long term relationship must not be good."     [*]"Oh, no! you said this silly thing that he wasn't interested in! Did you just ruin EVERYTHING??"     [*]"It's been 3 days without a date. Are you not meant to be?? Maybe you're breaking up!"     [*]"Oh, no! Nothing particularly groundbreaking happened on your date! Is you relationship never going to get better??"     [*]"You met a homeless person on the street. Are you one day going to become homeless?? Now you're so shaken that you don't want to talk to anyone!"     [*]"He's sitting an inch too far away. Relationship crisis!"     [*]"He didn't laugh that much!"     [*]"His tone was neutral when he said this!"     [*]"He didn't kiss you on the lips this one time!"  [/list] None of those things indicated issues, but the narrator and character kept pretending that they did so there could be some imaginary "conflict".  "I feel like you don't want to be with me," despite that I took every opportunity possible to go out with him and there was no reason he should have felt like I didn't want to be with him.   "We have a lot to work out," the only disagreement we had at all was whether or not we should have had sex in the first 3 dates.   [i]"'I care [about sex] plenty. Maybe that's why I don't jump into it.' You feel a little bad about lying.[/i] But only a little." How is that a lie? Another presumption on the author's part: that if you haven't had sex, it must be because you don't like the person rather than because you don't want to jump into it.  "You know you and Ray need to talk," about what? We'd had no issues over anything. But fine: we talked and worked it out. Next time we met: "we didn't really talk," yes, we did. But okay, we talked again. We worked things out. Next time we met: "we need to talk". Seriously, why did we keep needing to talk about the same thing? We worked things out already. Move on, talk about other things, do other things.   "[The restaurant] looks like the kind of place where people declare their love for each other. Yikes! No matter how warm you might feel for him, it's probably way too soon for that kind of thinking." Except that I had already declared by love for him before this, so this was just more forced conflict. Even after both my character and Ray established that we were dating, that we were boyfriends, etc., still on the next page "it's too soon to say you're dating. You don't know where you stand. There's more talking to be done." There really wasn't.  Several times the author made the character say stupid shit that then led to arguments and awkward moments perfectly avoidable if the author didn't make the character such a fool. More forced conflict, but not even forced conflict from making choices. Forced conflict from the author forcing my character to make stupid choices. I simply chose to meet up with Ray; the author had the character make a retarded joke that Ray didn't think was funny; then "yikes! This isn't going well. Maybe you two won't work out."   Finally at the end there were choices on how to "improve": be more assertive, be more trusting, be more romantic, be more open. My character was already all 4 of these, so no matter which I chose, the result was some stupid "hmm, you already are such-and-such so it's surprising you feel this way." Then maybe give more options, dufus.
I really wanted to like Love at Elevation. I adore many of the other games by Choice of Games, however this one just irked me and I felt as though I had to push myself to keep going at times.   This is the first game from them that feels tedious. Frustrating. Just... couldn't finish it.  This game appeals to a certain person, and I personally am not that person, but aside from that, it just irks me. I use irk as to be my feeling towards the very descriptive nature of the story. I feel like I am having Boulder, Colorado etched into the very fibers of my mind and memory, street by street. Athlete by coffee hippie. I get the way the book is trying to set everything up and really the overall basis of trying to find yourself after getting away from a toxic ex is appealing. To engulf yourself into your new surroundings - but there is an overly hippie vibe that gets thrust upon you even when you don't want to be that type of person entirely. Thus the story and the vibe begin to break down. It feels forced.   I would recommend trying a different game by Choice of Games and Hosted Games - this just... really isn't worth the price and really worth your frustration.
On the surface this sounded like the sort of game I really needed in my life right now, I appreciated that it was basically a choose-your-own-adventure type story based on romance and that it both lets you set your gender and your preferred romantic partners, but... wow could the story not be any less my thing!  Your character, seemingly with little effect from your choices, is basically a big hipster who romanticizes Boulder, Colorado (of all places?), as well as bikes, climbing, coffee shops, and activism (but, like, in the short time I gave the game a try I didn't see anything too serious so I suspect more along the lines of "share Buzzfeed listicles about endangered birds on Facebook" activism than, y'know, actual activism?) which is all pretty unforuante since I'm a woke Midwest gay who hates the idea of moving West and isn't into physical activity or either coffee or tea, so it was just a bunch of choices one after another that had absolutely no appeal to me? Maybe it would've gotten better, but it definitely just got to the point where I wasn't enjoying myself at all, so it wasn't worth sticking through it to find out unfortunately.  If you're a hipster that dreams of moving to a medium-sized desert city where you can get high at a coffee shop, then you'll probably have a better time with this game than I did, but this story just really wasn't for me!
This game can be kind of tedious to play. Three main problems in my opinion.  1. Limited roleplaying options. If you're not a hippy you're not going to have a good time because all the options are hippy options. Like if you think traditional 'medicine' is not only dumb but dangerous and unethical and that it should be illegal, well, your character will still have a positive attitude toward it. Don't think meditation is helpful or worthwhile? Too bad, your character will still meditate? Not a yuppie? Too bad, you will still fetishize foreign cultures without understanding them because your character is a hippy.  2. The romance is tedious and annoying. There is unnecessary drama. I had no interest in maintaining more than one relationship at once but the game still keeps pushing romantic options on you at every turn and keeps making you reaffirm that you're committed to the relationship. At some point it just gets insulting when you're asked 10 times in a row whether you want to break up or cheat on your current partner.  3. No matter what choice you make, the game criticizes you about it. Despite railroading you into relationships you don't want and not letting you cut ties with your ex.
What ticked me off about this game was that I always had to choose between romance and sex.  A trusted and successful relationship can lead to satifactory sex. They aren't neccessarily incompatible. But in so many choice situations, it always seemed to be carnal VS romance. And during one relationship with certain someone, I got broken up with because I didn't let him get to third base in previous two dates, and I didn't even get the option to explain that I'm strongly againt pre-marital sex.  Also the relationship between you and ex seemed weird and pretty unclear. Why did I break up with him? What part of him I just coundn't handle anymore? Or simply: what kind person was he?  And maybe it's just a (fictional) Boulder City thing, but this free spirit vibe coming from so many charactes just seemed very ugly and repulsive to me.
On the surface, this game sounded like something I would enjoy. What I found was a script for a frustrated romance comedy. Have you heard that real pilots find MS Flight Simulator harder than real flying due to the lack of necessary feedback? THAT describes this game perfectly.  Add in the forced drama scenes that happen no matter what you do, and you have the setting for real frustration.  Wait for a sale if you are going to try this. NOT Reccommended
Not a terrible plot for a short story, decent sex scenes... that's all. Everything else in this game ended up irking me one way or another. The "issues" we had with the RO were forced and came literally out of nowhere, especially the 1st time they were brought up. All the consequent times were slightly less jarring, as I was more prepared, but no less unfounded and forced. The mandatory choice you have to make between wholeness, fitness and activism all the time was especially irritating, since I couldn't care less about any of these things. I only ended up mildly interested in fitness because going for a hike now and then seemed a relatively neutral activity that I could see my MC partaking in. Another irritating thing is how this game handles introductions. The initial meeting with the "1st choice RO" is okay (let's forget how the MC instantly starts evaluating them as a potential lover), but the other 2 that you meet after are just... off: "Hello, I thought you were someone else, now I'm looking at you with alluring bedroom eyes, want to get involved in activism? Call me!" and "Hello, beautiful, let me just plant my derrière at your table... You're here on a date? Well, no problem, how about you call me later?" And every single time the game wants you to choose whether to be interested. Even if you've clearly indicated that you only ever do one person at a time (even if he acts like an idiot and accuses you of being a horndog after a single time you 2 ever had sex - the fact that I didn't dump his butt after that should be indicative of how serious I am about giving this relationship a chance. But I digress). I forgot to count how many times (3 or 4?) the game urged me to re-evaluate our relationship and maybe break up or at least go fool around with one or both of the other 2 RO's. Even AFTER the MC and the 1st RO both came to a conclusion that everything shall be fine during the 1st forced serious discussion that happened. Nope, that would be too easy and realistic, here is another "we should talk"! And another! With the same questions being raised every time! Almost makes you wonder why the hell you are even allowed to have an exclusive relationship if both the MC and the RO are bound to be so darn uncertain about whether or not they should pursue it. It felt like the game expected me to blast through all of the RO's in a single playthrough, either by sleeping around or discarding one RO in favour of another. The job, the bosses, the colleagues (friendly and not so much) and briefly-mentioned friends that you could call all felt like fillers. Sure, there were hints at most of them having character and personal story, but... no. Nothing but unrealized potential here. The ex was fine... as far as exes go. Perfect for satisfying your inner masochist, if you are into that. (I personally felt like indulging, this time). Not so perfect if you are predetermined to erase them from your life entirely, in which case they just serve as yet another source of frustration. The Boulder itself - for me, it is just a location where the story is taking place. For the narrator, it appears, the city is somehow important. It is given a lot of attention, and the MC is expected to have an opinion about it (well, they ended up here, after all, even left the ex behind to move, and it wasn't a random choice, yet I fail to understand their reasons). Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't see why. None of the descriptions of places or people made me feel anything worth mentioning. Boulder being a special place is more of an informed attribute for me. The most noticeable thing about this game is how the MC appears to be completely alone all the time. Not literally, more like emotionally. As if nobody is there for them. They are on their own in this city full of strangers, with no one to come back to Even the RO, even at the endgame, doesn't inspire any feelings of security, you know? Same story (actually, there isn't much of it, if any, and it doesn't branch at all), different RO's. The only difference is how you go about it - do you play the field, do you stay with one RO, do you break up and move on to another, do you get back with your ex... Also, even though the choice of RO affects personal scenes (like sex), most scenes and relationship troubles are shared.
I don't quite reccomend this game, as I would suggest another Choice of Games selection like Hollywood Visionary or Choice of Robots, however perhaps give it a shot and see how you feel about the game.   Having played many other games from CoG, this one I simply couldn't bring myself to finish. It felt like I was having romance shoved down my throat [strike](AND I AM A SUCKER FOR LOTS OF ROMANCE - DUH)[/strike]. I felt like the story was one that could be rather well fleshed out yet it just... felt as though it lacked in some ways certain responses played out. I liked some of the ideas and factions, being the history nerd I am, and just wish things kind of happened differently than they did.   I understand romance to be a big part of the game, but I liken this to the game CoG released through their user-made stories via Hosted Games, Love at Elevation - in that with that game, the very OVERLY descriptive way the game and story were written felt shoved down my throat, the romance aspect of this game was smacking me across the face.   Perhaps if you've played other CoG games and just want to try yet another one, maybe try this out, but if you're new to Choice of Games, I would personally recommend Choice of Robots, or Hollywood Visionary, or if you really want a good romance then pick The Wayhaven Chronicles from CoG's side publishing through Hosted Games.
I wanted to enjoy this game, however it was very frustraiting to achieve what you want, choices are presented that are actualy imposible to achive like mariages or arresting th villian, stats barely move and the how you invest money doesnt matter as the game ends as soon as the investment is complete, it ended very abrubtly and awkwardly, a lot of potential and well written but very little character agency,
In general, I am a fan of Choice of Games/Hosted Games, but I can't recommend this entry in the CoG line.    First, while I wasn't expecting anything special in the 'running a railroad' aspect, it is quite bare.  Sometimes it will even force you into bankruptcy even if you are doing otherwise well (plenty of money, etc.)  Second, even if you do well, the game penalizes you on the business side if you don't go down the romance path.  Yes, I understand part of the conceit is that your being forced to marry.  However, at least one epilogue should have an outside business offer you a position so that as long as you were successful, even if you lost the railroad, you could spite your father.  Third, the game didn't really provide enough chances to really interact with the ROs.  Part of this is that it tried to present a large number of people, and they mostly ended up forgettable.  Fourth, there are still some bugs/misspellings/etc. that were reported, and haven't been fixed.  What is also unfortunate is that I actually liked some of the groups, etc. that were mentioned in game and would have liked to see that better integrated.    
The stats were entirely too tedious to actually get anywhere.... and I didn't really appreciate the game either forcing you to be a woman or a gay man. I got through the first chapter before I decided it just wasn't worth even finishing. 1/10. Honestly regret buying this one.
This had so much potential, but your decisions mean nothing.  There is one path shoved down your throat, but you never have any opportunity to take the initiative on anything meaningful.  There are two times you get to choose what your character does outside of work over the course of a week, and you are supposed to institute reform, become a member of the social scene, and/or find a wife in that time?  How?    A game about running a business as a new CEO is interesting.  A game about social and romantic life as the head of a business is interesting.  Either of those ideas requires time to develop, though.  In addition, a choose your own adventure game requires choice.  Based on the lack of meaningful choice, I really hate that this game is considered CYOA.  As a minor "pro," I will admit that the writing really is decent.  Maybe if this were more a video game style story with a completely pre-determined narrative, it could be an interesting one.  All I could think about was how I couldn't do anything, though.
Genuinely a bit of a pain. It's hard to raise your stats high enough to do anything, and balancing things almost never works. Rather little variation in paths, despite several playthroughs with different choices; for example, investing in infrastructure does not, in fact, prevent a train from derailing. Some rather odd choices, or perhaps bugs; going "Who are these people?", a request that normally tells you who someone is in a game by Choice of Games without wasting a conversational opportunity, as you're not actually talking to someone, and are simply recalling who they are, does, in fact, waste a conversational opportunity. I suspect part of the issue is the dual nature of the game; by not focusing on either romance or trains, both areas suffer quite a bir. It does have its good points; you can expressly play a person of color, and it's not locked to being straight because of the time period, though the trappings of reality sometimes bog the game down. (I rather wish the game were set in a fully fictional world; I feel this might've given the author more breathing room, so to speak.) In all, the writing is good, but more work needs to be done on the actual game portion of the game.
Not exactly what I expected it to be, or rather, hoped to be. I'll go over some pros & cons for people who are considering the game.  PROS: + Quite a few songs to choose from (more than I expected). + Low price, especially on sale. + Can easily edit the key bindings & some of the visuals. + Most images that go with the songs look pretty cool, lots of different styles.  CONS: - If you don't want the fastest scrolling speed, you need to adjust this at the start of each new song. - Though there are many songs, most of them are in the same sort of style... And I found only a few to be really fun to listen to. - There is no tutorial or explanation when first starting the game. Not even a quick overview of where everything can be found/what everything means. Definitely not recommended for people who haven't played this type of game before. - As far as I can see, you can only play individual songs on 2 difficulties (and with 4 or 6 fingers). There isn't a career mode or anything.  So basically, you just pick a few songs you like to play and you play them. You get a score at the end, but I don't really feel like the score matters in any way. There seemed to be a few unlockable/purchaseable songs as well, but I didn't really look into it. I feel like, if I'm an hour into a game and I'm still not really having fun, then it's just not a fun game.  So not recommended by me. Even when it's on sale, it's not really worth the cash to get through an hour of alright gameplay.
Good game, purchased because of great visuals. But disappointed due the lack of difficulty, game was simply too easy for me. Even the hardest song was a walk in the park. I could literally full combo any song on the first go. Maybe its just because im a 3 year osu veteran. But ranting aside, the game is nice and cheap and great for beginners to get started to music rhythm genre. Its well optimised and runs pretty smooth even for a slightly low end pc.
[h1] The most terrible rhythm game I've played in my life. [/h1]  Design wise, the in-game layout is physically damaging for your eyes, with mini lens flares on each note and all kinds of needless garbage that litters the whole screen. It is very normal for fast-paced rhythm games to induce some level of nausea, due to its scroll-based nature, but this game takes it to a whole new level. Settings consist of strict master volume control, this is one of the biggest issues I've come across, since the game decided to add its own sound effects as hit-sounds, using samples from the song itself at times that play when you hit a note. This creates an irreparable issue, since no human in the world is rhythmically talented enough to play the song perfectly as its bpm dictates, songs can become a jumbled mess, with the usual background music and the added sound effects doing their own thing respectively. Rhythm games are usually played by music enthusiasts - the ability to play along with your favorite song, while enjoying the song at the same time is a key aspect that any rhythm game needs to take into account when designing their game.   As mentioned however, songs become very difficult to enjoy and any errors you make in hitting the notes can result in an endless barrage of mistakes following your first one, since you lose track of the song's rhythm itself, all disgustingly layered on top of each other and messing with your head.   Back to the limitations of the settings options - a master volume control, a resolution picker before the game is launched and the choice between 2 vaguely described options of high performance and low performance. Within the game - scroll speed of the notes and the choice between a couple backgrounds/layouts, one in classic 2d format and the other in 3d, both as visually cancerous as they can get, so pick your poison.   A small, quaint and cute looking shop that consists of [b] exclusively advertising the astronomically highly priced DLC [/b], which would empty the average user's entire steam wallet when the game itself was 1/10th of the price, I don't think i need to expand on that part further.   Loading screen that takes forever each time it appears - the loli 8bit girls that try their best to bring you the next screen/song need an upgrade, maybe nitro powered shoes or something, [i] I don't know. [/i]  It's hard to take any of this seriously when the game itself is a complete joke.  The countless negatives aside, the song selection is alright, probably because I got accustomed to chinese music from another rhythm game called INVAXION (which is heaven compared to this mess, although it has quite a few terrible reviews, while this has great overall reviews - again, something that irritates and confuses me as much as this game itself.) And quite a few popular doujin artists from Japan and some known names in other rhythm games, although you'd have to search behind your couch and sell your unborn child to get that sweet DLC that they're waving in front of your eyes.   Apologies for the low play-time though, I really couldn't take this eye r*ping and brain melting game any longer. If you want good rhythm games, surely you can look elsewhere.                                                      Refundamus                                                  This             Trashy                                                                       Gameinus
70% of the songs make the game freeze. The game devs don't care and won't fix it. Don't buy.
[b]DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAY A LOT OF RHYTHM GAMES[/b]  this game is incredibly easy if you play a ton of rhythm games. most of the hardest charts on this game are extremely basic if you're used to playing very hard charts, not to mention the timing is way too lenient as well.  if this is your first rhythm game, give it a shot. if you're an advanced player, don't buy this.
Game is stuck on loading screen when attempting to play a track. This has been te case since the latest update. 
it will be good if the dev let us make our custom theme. The default classic theme is hurting my eyes tbh, and buying new theme for some bucks is not an option for me. I'm not really recommend this game (just play *su! instead of this). But, getting this game while on sale is a good option if you wanna try this game.
I woud not recommend this game for beginners and experienced rhythm game players.  -The game is just to easy you don't need to be accurate at all for hitting ''EXACT'' on every note and the song difficulty is only up to 10 (wich is to compare to difficulty ±10 in StepMania or 2 star on osu!) -Not allot of songs or you need to buy the DLC, I woudn't mind buying it if the songs weren't so easy  So for new people who are looking for a real rythem game i woud recommend StepMania unlimited amount of songs and they are all FREE and challanging
It's a beautiful game but in mobile is free to play.  So first to buy it play in mobile.
Pros  - Anime - Leaderboards  Cons - As an experience rhythm game player, song difficulties brings no challenge. Osu-mania! and Stepmania brings more difficult mapsets. I easily EX'ed the most difficulty song in the game (not including songs in the Forever friends bundle) which is a Hard Lvl. 10 with 120% Sync rate and it was first try, Not boasting here just pointing out that the game lacks contents for hardcore rhythm game players. There is another song with an unknown level ("??") in the hard sets and also EX'ed that with 119.54% sync rate first try. I assume its around Hard Lvl. 12. Again lack of content for experience rhythm game players. - (Personal preference), Would have been better if it had a balance number between japanese and chinese songs. But currently, chinese songs are dominant. - No multiplayer - Lack of customization. Only think you can choose to your preference are speed, judgement line and field-view. Would have been better if you can circulate between arrows, circles and bar notes and some game modifiers to make the songs harder would be better too. - You can't find the song you want to play easily. There's no search bar and you need to manually browse throughout the song list which is really really frustating.   TL;DR: If you're a beginner in rhythm games, give this a try. If not, then don't since the mapsets are relatively easy especially if you have 3+ years of experience in this type of rhythm games. Refunded. 
You know, I usually write joke reviews. But this game dissapointed me more then ever, I bought this thinking I would spend my life playing a rhythm game like Osu, but what I got was a game with not a lot of songs and if you want the true experience you must buy the dlc. I wouldn't mind if the game if it had more songs, but the song choice is pretty poor. The fact I have to pay more then most indie games just to play more songs makes me sad, please. Update your game page or something to say getting the DLC has the true experience, I feel ripped off and I am ashamed of it. 4/10   TL;DR: If you want to play some songs, this game is fine. But if you want a real rhythm game, either buy the DLC with the game in a budle or don't even buy it.
You can literally button mash and never drop your combo. Went from feeling like it required skill in the vein of other rhythm games, to feeling like I could just cheat my way to the end. Hopefully they'll fix that at some point. For now, refunding.
Not hard enough.
I mean its not a bad game by any means but there is a game out there called stepmania, which is basically this and its free. you can also download songpacks for that game for free. Stepmania is also way more precise as the timing window is much smaller and it has a cleaner looking UI. It also dosent do that choppy sound thing when you press on the keys durring the song. Not a bad game by any means, that being said go play stepmania
Refunded it, only because theres currently no way to disable the annoying special effects and things that just hurts your eyes when your trying to focus. Also its like 80% anime music, and im not into that at all, all i want is EDM/dubstep or hell even piano songs are fine, but there are so few.  Sure there might be a bunch of those song types in the DLC pack, but thats more than 20€.  Id rather play stepmania for free than pay 20€+ for a steam game. christ
absolutely no point in buying this game, because osu excists and its free. save your money
As casual rythym player its easy for newcomers to join in. Even the 'harder' are  farily easy if you have some experience any rythym games.  But if your someone more serious than me I would give this a pass since this caters to the new players. Judgement timers are very forgiving. I find the defualt setting forgiving and I was still able get a meh score on a hard song (lvl 6) in the few minutes that I have played. (I'm currently in class supposed to be doing work so I cant comment this game too much.)  Also there was no option to change the scroll direction of the notes to hit since I am a Stepmania player. (Stepmania default setting goes up, this game and osu!mania goes down.  After a bit more playing the music were mostly in chinese and would like more variety in music in the base pack (no hate I am part chinese) and when you hit the notes you acutally play the music notes and playing them off beat really throws me off.
Basically a 5 dollar demo, which isn't the end of the world. The biggest issue I have is that the game simply isn't hard enough. The fact is is that I'm not that amazing at most BENAMI games. If you even look at my osu! account you will see that I'm pretty awful at mania. But alas I love a good rhythm game and wanted to give MUSYNX a try.   All in all the game is very stylish and very often presentable. The few charts I tried had very good visuals, with the exception of one that made the chart quite difficult to read. All in all, the presentation of the game is really nice.  As I said though, the game is just too easy for me, the first thing I did was FC a lvl.8 chart (4K), which is already isn't great; but moving on to lvl.10 (4K) charts (the hardest including without the CAD$25 DLC) I 4 missed, and could more than likely FC with few tries. Even with 4K it felt far too easy. 6K offers more difficulty of course, but not nearly enough for any rhythm game fan to truly get much value from this. What's more is that you are given years to hit the note, even with these harder charts, It was rare not getting an exact, even if mashing. Takes the rhythm out of the rhythm game (and this is coming from an osu! std player)  Song wise without the full version, it's okay. Get artists like Memme which is very welcome, as well as Vocaloid tracks and the Nekopara theme song (:cinnamon2:). Nothing truly stood out in my opinion, but the song listing seems pretty good.  If the majority of the game wasn't behind a huge paywall, I would be more forgiving to the difficulty, but this is hard to recommend. Once again the presentation and song choice is pretty good, but the difficulty just doesn't seem there, you can make a 4K charts far more difficult; maybe it would feel more fun with a controller, but controller support isn't there (odd for a game on consoles). I can't recommend this game, but it's almost there. Hopefully a sequel can make more interesting and difficult charts, and not hide the game behind a paywall 5 times the price of the base game.
Dont buy it, osu is free
MUSYNX good game but I feel there is no incentive to play. no unlock skin no unlock music no leaderboard no online competition
This game doesn't sync well with the music; you can just spam DFJK and somehow get a high rank. It is a really shitty bootleg "osu!mania" game; I think it's best if you play the actual Osu! game than playing some crappy rythmn game that tries to cop the mechanics of Osu!mania  btw keep in mind that if you go to the shop to view the DLC that you can buy; it's 26 CAD (or a something else in a different currency).  EDIT: I didn't know that someone is trying to defend shitty rythmn games; look buddy. If you don't like seeing what people put down; don't bother making a Facebook and Twitter post about why the "rythmn" community is getting worse or what fucking ever.
This game doents make any sense, it just you go to the hardest song in the game, and press the buttons like crazy that you pass with an ''A'' (tested and proven by me). Besides that its IMPOSSIBLE to lose, now answer me, WHAT THE FUCK?
easiet gameplay (smash ur kb and get S), also full chinese songs
Right so this game is a no go for me dog. I love rythme games but this one isnt that great. I picked it up since its like osu! mania mode and it was cheap so i got it. The first down side for me is doesnt have a color blind mode which sucks for me. The highest lvl of song is lvl 6 without DLC wich is hella over priced. The lvl 6 song is really not hard at all and i would prob say its a 1.5 star in osu! at most. Just get osu! since its free you have a lot of songs and a lot of differnt skins for the game as well.
I want to recommend this but I currently can't due to a couple issues.   1st is definitely my fault for not reading the store page: Only supports keyboard input currently. I played this game a bit on Vita and knew it has a switch version so I assumed it would have controller support out of the box, which I wanted to utilise. Looking at the forums other people mention this, so hopefully it's something that will be implemented in a future update.  Can work around this by using Steam's excellent built in controller mappings to bind your controller to keyboard keys (at least for Dualshock 4  & Steam controllers.)  2nd is that the keybindings don't allow you to use the Numpad. DFJK is a bit cramped for my hands, so I was going to use DF and 45 on the numpad but it doesn't seem to be supported. I could get around this by using an external program to rebind my numpad, but that'd be quite inconvenient.   Otherwise, as long as you enjoy or even tolerate the music that is in the game, I think it's a great value. The game's song navigation UI is definitely a bit bad for PC use, and unless I missed it I can't seem to find a way to set the default speed for songs. I do appreciate being able to set the speed of notes individually for each song, though. Classic mode view is great, as well.   If the issues I listed don't apply/bother you (or once they get fixed) then I'd definitely recommend this game.  EDIT:  The note detection seems really lenient, too. I went into a song and just mashed all 6 keys really fast (varying speeds, but all at the same time pretty much.) I ended up getting a 103.05% A-Rank with the majority of my notes being "Exacts" Only 2 "Misses" and 8 "Rights" (the lowest 2) and about half the number of "Great" as exacts.  I dunno if this is really a problem as I'm not sure if anyone would actually play the game that way as it's not really enjoyable and it defeats the purpose of actually playing. Figured I might as well mention it, though.
The base game is filled with god awful songs with chinese lyrics. In order to aquire more songs (songs you'll most likely like), you have to buy an entire DLC pack. Which is also filled with awful songs, I'd say its about 60/40 in terms of bad vs good. If you're looking to buy songs you like separately then you'll not find it here.  I'd rather spend that $20+ on buying songs that I actually enjoy in the forever friends pack separately. Than getting a buttload of songs that are just extremely bad. Not entirely sure why there's no other options with buying songs. It also looks like they have zero plans on adding different options. The game also doesn't have controller support, at least none of mine worked.   If you're looking for a rhythm game that's on steam, you have Groove Coasters, TapSonic BOLD and an upcoming game called INVAXION - Which is in the same style as Musynx but more polished.
Songs from this pack can't be played in Arcade mode, where you can't select music for the matches.  You are basically paying for this music to be available only in online matches.  Worst rip off ever.
says it in my library but i can't find it in my port or anywhere in the game .. its been months
Got the things in my account. Kinda upset I can't just buy 50 though. XD Limit one purchase per steam acct.
I am dissapointed at this very missleading purchase. I have purchased 10 Guineas and it does not show in my main account arsenal. My clan told me to download new client on Steam. This gave me a whole new account and no way of transfering Guineas to Wargamming account. It was only 0.79p but the point is it could of been ships I purchased. I have contacted wargamming they say I must contact you but there is no clear way to post a complaint. Feel conned and its only 0.79p
Its been 24 hours, the guineas are still not in my account.  EDIT: Going on 10 days, still waiting.
I spend not much time with the game because of two mechanics that breaks the game for me. One of them is ,the character can become paranoid and if it kicks in you can’t move for a moment. If this happens in the moment you want to passing by a place there is a lightning that can kill you then you can repeat the hole level. Same thing if you get chased, this was so annoying. There is a possibility to heal you, but that isn’t helping much if the place to do so is on the other end of the level. The second thing I don’t like is, that you can’t save your progress in the level itself.
This is not fun or good, gets boring very fast, you fall in the bottomless pit a lot, because  it has very few different rooms & most of them have nothing in them. The artwork is horrible, not in a good way. Not worth the full price. If you really need it for your Lovecraft collection, wait for a sale.
Super short game (took less than 1 hour to finish it) which doesn't have enough content (story or gameplay). Nice art but that's not enough to be a game. Looks more like a demo/pitch
[h1]follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews[/h1]   Really short game, it's just a handful of logical puzzles. Most of which are not really fun. The map navigation can be fun, but why on earth don't they give you the map from the start? you have to find it by luck, which is not very fair. Once you got the map the maze navigation becomes interesting. Unfortunately, once you've solved two levels and a half the game is already over. The last puzzle is just annoying. It's a pity as some of the graphic animations looked nice.
Becomes quickly repetitive and boring.
As of right now the game is not finished, after I finished the abondonded tunnels and made it outside, I opened a door and the game closed itself because it was missing a door grahpic file. The game is fun and i'm excited to finish it, but as of right now the game is unplayable.
Personally, I love the game. However  I am disappointed with the cheat map I purchased as I have  tried everything I can think of to open it . If it's a error on my part someone please let me know. I see no way to access it in game or from my library though it shows it is installed. Im using windows platform. I saw that someone else had this issue too. Please fix if it's a bug or refund my money or better yet send me a DL link for the cheat map on itchio if that version works cause I am not purchasing it again. ( I want all the endings *cries*)
I purchased the cheat map, but now I can't seem to figure out hoe to access it. I don't want to give a thumbs down when it might just be me being an idiot, but I feel like I just paid money for a giant load of nothing. Can someone please help me out?
Im confused, I purchased this dlc after getting the game and it says its installed but I only hear the background music and no voice samples though ive played Karns entire route. Is there a special way i have to turn the soundtrack on or a place for me to access it?
I have always been a fan of Heluo Studio, played all their games, but srsly this game is a insult to fan base
Story is fine, graphic is fine but screen crashing is not fine. Tonnes of screen crashing when certain loading, went black and out of commission, even want to take a rest at hotel. IT IS KILLING MY MOOD!
1. 眼高手低，不自量力 -- 在根本沒足夠經驗、技術和構想力下強推全3D，結果跑路會卡著走不了，戰鬥會被場景360度全方位屏蔽，讓你看不到敵人位置或自己的走位，更甚者是，即令你自行調較到一個可看見全場的角度，到下一個角式出招時，畫面又會轉回該角式的主觀視角，於是你再一次看不見大局，又要再次調較，而部份戰鬥更因之而在畫面外進行，打中還是打不中都不明不白。 2. 內存佔耗極高 (97%)，卡、頓、死機、跳出、黑畫面無反應等等大量供應，基本上玩15-30分鐘就要退出/跳出一次.... 玩這遊戲真的要做完每個動作都要儲存一次，否則你花多少時間去練級都可以在下一秒死機報癈。 千萬別買，除非你玩遊戲不是為娛樂，而是為發飈。
游戏本是不错的，但bug多的吓人，卡顿也就算了， 玩了大约50小时， 当机不少过10次。很多当机的时候都是在剧情或战斗前后， 有时1小时的过程就这样没了，除了让人抓狂还是抓狂。 我玩的已是1.26 patch， 但bug与当机问题还是不能让人接受。除非你心脏强悍（不容易抓狂）， 否则还是请不要入坑吧。

太多BUG 了.......................
优化还没做好？！？！？都2019了，mb 3440x1440 还是溢出屏幕的，干什么吃的？
犹豫了很久，还是给了差评。真的很想给好评的，但是游戏很一般。卡顿，画面差，游戏有点没头没脑。不知道驱使人去玩的核心是什么。是操作呢？是队友互动呢？是收集呢？是故事呢？是画面呢？都不咋样。一个毫无核心优势的游戏，即使再炒作情怀，也让人打不出好评。从上一部前传开始就觉得这个公司其实在根本上缺乏做好游戏的能力。无论是老板还是员工实际能力都很差。不要再说情怀了，游戏就是游戏。河洛一天到晚把国产武侠的使命挂在嘴上，但是国产武侠画面，人设，故事，操作的标杆有古剑3和神舞幻想，游戏性标杆有太吾绘卷，希望河洛的老板和员工去玩一玩古剑3，反思下自己能力。再去玩一玩太吾绘卷，反思下自己思维创意。

Not bad in itself, but you can get [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=464920&requiredtags=Radio]better "radio stations" in the Workshop[/url].  My advice, only get this in a bundle.
The beautiful graphics only serve to disguise an exceptionally boring game.    The visuals are wonderful, so one would think the rest of the game would be as intricate. It is not. The gameplay is just chores, exclusively just chores. Talk to one thing, it wants you to go somewhere else and interact with something before it will let you progress. That is almost the entire game is just back and forth chores, will a rare simple puzzle here and there.  The music doesn't fit at all. There's nothing atmospheric about its composition, it's just music. Music which changes to different tracks based on the location with there being no logic towards why each track is played in each place. You have this really solemn cute world but the music is just, whatever somebody could come up with.  The dialogue is absolutely monotonous. The translation is readable but still noticeably translated, but nobody has anything interesting to say. The dialogue is void of passion or purpose, each conversation just being a boring normal every day conversation one would have with random people you are trying to get information from or random people obstructing your way forward. This reads like something written hundreds of years ago back before humans were capable of being genuinely creative, and considering everything in the game is mostly just based off mildly fantasized real life concepts the lack of creativity is quite consistent.  Stopped playing early, because every interaction is just a chore and every conversation is completely boring.  Having one of the riddles a character gives you be a question about who developed this game; arrogant or immersion breaking, actually it's both.   Basically paying five dollars to see the art as there's no real gameplay here, no sense of atmosphere and no interesting story or even interesting dialogue period.
TOO UNORGANIZED    - interesting theme but terribly arranged and polished   - bad script writing  - the subjects are way too much unorganized; they just don't get united  - no windows mode  - slow-paced  - absense of drama (which is the core of text-based adventure game)  - not interesting characters, not interesting relationships  - unclear system design and user interface  - bad music (is this midi file?)   it was interesting experience however I don't want to play this game again..    학창시절 교과서에서 보던 미술작품들을 다시보는 건 흥미로웠지만 그 흥미는 5분 이상 가지 않았음.. 어드벤처 게임으로서 매력이 전혀 없고 기대되거나 긴장되는 게 없음. 양작들 보면 어드벤처 게임 특유의 로우페이스는 어쩔 수 없더라도 대화문을 재미있게 꾸미거나 재미있는 상황 재미있는 캐릭터를 등장시켜서 흥미를 유지하던데 이건 고증을 너무 열심히 한 나머지 거의 원형 그대로라 그냥 그 문화재를 박물관에서 직접 보는대신 이 게임을 플레이해야 할 이유를 딱히 못느끼겠고 문화재를 맥락없이 많이 등장시켜서 뚜렷한 테마가 안느껴짐.. 박물관에서 전시를 해도 기획전시엔 주제별 묶음이 있는데.. 같은 반 친구가 만들었다고 보내주는 거였다면 정말 재미있었을 텐데 제작자와 개인적인 친분도 없고 + 스팀에서 돈내고 플레이하고 있는거다보니 영 기대보다 실망스러움.. 그리고 음악 너무 별로임. 학생 작품 아마추어 작품 분류였으면 재밌었다고 박수칠테지만 스팀 발매된 거면 공식발표인데.. 응원해주는 차원에서 사볼만 하다고 생각함
Sometimes you buy a game because it is on sale.  Then three or four weeks pass and you remember you bought this game.  Then you play it!  Refund please...."Steam customer service rep - Sorry you have had the game for more than two weeks".    The moral of the story is try the game before the two week grace period ends.  As for a review, this is a repetitive wave shooter, it is boring and not worth the sale price,
Looks great, feels cool, but same old boring wave nonsense. I played once, didn't ask for refund, but honestly doubt I'll play it again.  Let's hope for better from VR in the future.
Islamaphobic. This game is not fun to play, but I blind play indie horror games on my stream. I have never received more complains about an episode. Don't even play this if it was gifted to you.
It's not crazy,but it could be better,there's no map,and it's tough to find items
Not the most entertaining of games but fortunately it's quite short. The game runs poorly considering the poor graphics, it has fixed in-game keys and menu options that sometimes overlap each other. It's not scary whatsoever either. The monsters are dumb and will completly ignore you when having their back turned and sometimes they just stand in a corner and they wont even attack if you shoot at them. Add to the list that you get stuck if you try to jump upon an open box or a shelf on the side and will then need to reload a checkpoint.
I don't know what i did to be here classic scares pretty dumb gun mechs no thanks :)
How do you heal? I put 7 shots into the enemy and it did damage to me from halfway across the room. It was just there crouched down killing me. This game needs work.
there no option to turn off motion blur.
4/10  I didn't go into 03.04 expecting too much, and I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics and lack of bugs in what seems like a pretty low-budget affair. In 03.04, you'll traverse through three different environments to atone for some of the supposedly-many sins committed by your character. Visually, these resemble a school, an apartment complex, and a train station. You'll run into three different types of demons that you'll need to dispatch, with either a knife, a pistol, or a shotgun. These demons seem to in some way represent your own mental derangement, and developer JPEG of Pain spaces out some truly excellent jump scares. It is hinted that perhaps this exercise is being undertaken as a result of [spoiler]your own guilt.[/spoiler]  The game is mostly inoffensive, but there were a few irritations: *The enemies that walk using the metal poles always glitched out upon dying. *The shotgun, which the game makes a big deal about, actually seems worse than the pistol, the first weapon you get. It shoots slower, must be reloaded more often, and you are unable to attach a flashlight to it. It doesn't seem to pack much more firepower either. *A crosshair would be a welcome addition to the game, even just to center yourself when picking up ammo/health. *It was a little frustrating to be unable to pick up health packs/syringes to be used at a later time. I often found myself backtracking (sometimes even up or down flights of stairs) to return to health items when I needed them. *The English translation was pretty shoddy, with awkward phrasing and misspellings.  03.04 wasn't the worst way to spend an hour and a half, but I can't say I really enjoyed myself. The developer puts a great deal of effort in letting you know just what an awful person your character is, but you aren't given all that many details about exactly what transpired in your past. [spoiler]It seems that I was a bully in school, but what did I actually do? Apparently I drove my girlfriend to suicide? Perhaps the developer could create one room in the apartment complex that appears to be that of my girlfriend, complete with paraphernalia. This might bring home to me the reality of what I've done.[/spoiler] Perhaps I would've had more patience with 03.04 if I hadn't recently played God's Basement, another game with a similar premise.
This game is ok, it does get a little repetitive when you fight the same monster 50 times but for the price it's fine. So if you want a ok horror expires then get it but it's not scary.
This game seems fun at first, sure for the price it doesnt seem bad but the story doesnt really make sense. Even though I selected english the only part of the game that was english was the text on the phone, the rest of it was in russian so it annoyed me and after restarting the game twice it still had the same problem. Besides that once you pick up the gun pressing "l" for the flashlight becomes useless and you instead of the hold tab with the gun just to be able to see. The aim isnt bad but it can be annoying because of how uncontrollable and random it is which can make hitting enemys annoying unless they are infront of you. It has you running through what looks like a russian school with a gun shooting enemys and trying to open certain door, the main mission never really seemed clear because the person on the phone never really gives any information but hitting tab would help if it wasnt in russian for me. Honestly for the price I paid I shouldnt have really had any high expectations the game needs work sure, the controls are weird and you cant press "L" for the flashlight when holding the gun which is annoying since you have to hold tab and you cannot run. The game needs work and some parts fixed but if you dont mind some bugs, buttons not working, enemys spawning in walls, and not understanding your task or anything in the game then you might like this game. I'll admit it was fun for a while and I would have gave this game a better rating if the choosing the language "english" made all text english and not just part of it and if it didnt crash for me.

Don't waste your money on this pack. Yes it has the 'Ultra instinct fight music' and 'Gohans SSJ2 transformation music' But these arent the full songs and abruptly cut off and loop. It's really jarring and not worth the money. Its not even a smooth loop, i could forgive them for doing that, it just fades out after x amount of seconds into the song and starts from the beginning again.
THIS GAME IS VERY STUPID !!! LỖI IS VERY NHIỀU !!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!  @Developer: Fix lỗi nhân đôi sát nhân, because this error make game very khó !!!
You try to get past the first part, but you can't because you die automatically due to SO MANY BUGS. There is NO way to escape the killer, he gets himself stuck in the doors and the moment you walk out you're dead. The chick as well just screams constantly, won't leave till you just accept that you found another bug and die to her. I tried MULTIPLE times to figure out a way around this, but in short... it's a VERY BUGGY GAME & needs to be REWORKED!
[h1]■□□□□□□□□□ 1 / 10[/h1]  Dread of Laughter is yet another unfinished product that has somehow managed to find its way onto Steam. It is truly mind-boggling how anyone would consider it ready for release.  The physics are literally all over the place; bumping into a chair sends it flying across the room like a football while elsewhere, some other object managed to almost immovably block a still very much needed doorway. One minute, the lights in any given room are on; the next, for no apparent reason they're off. Every time the killer catches up to you (and he doesn't need much to do that) it's 'game over' on contact. Dying means you have to restart from the beginning and there is no visible way of saving your progress. The main character goes "What's this?" in amazement literally [b]every[/b] single time she picks up an item and "It's locked!" for, you've guessed it, every locked door. The volume of these voiced lines isn't even properly adjusted, so it always feels like you're speaking way too loud in what is supposed to be a scary environment.  Then there's the options/settings menu. The default gamma level is ridiculously low (which really shows in dark spaces) while the volume is a bit too high; both start with their sliders on the far left but clearly you can't lower the volume here. There is no option at all to adjust the mouse sensitivity. While there are some buttons in the options menu, clicking does not visibly select anything. This list of defects just seems to go on and on.  There have been games on Steam with significantly fewer and smaller issues, with better graphics and more backstory that were half the price of Dread of Laughter and still not worth recommending. So, combined with the issues listed above: do yourself a favor and skip this one. You won't regret it.
Even Superman couldnt squeeze this lump hard enough to make a diamond out of it.  This fees like a facebook game with a neat initial "character maker" which is completely pointless after the main screen pops up.   "Why you say its like a facebook game?" Oh sorry... i mean its sub par with even facebook games, but this feels like its made in flash. Though even in flash it would have been more responsive. Its no fun to manually have to skip days to move on in this game. Especially when there is no on screen feedback anymore when skipping days. Its no fun to look at the same screen for hrs, without anything really happening.  I played Excel Spreadsheets that were move fun.  Rating 2/10 I wish there was actually a game here.
Really, really, really, really..........oh sorry i feel asleep. It's boring. Not really fun either. In summary, if you want to sit around like you are on a business call at all times than this is the game for you. If you don't like simple user interface's that have no change in visuals, this is exactly the game for you. In general, this is the game for the type of person that, might stare at a blank canvas and say "THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART I HAVE EVER SEEN!", or you just enjoy doing nothing.
I can't get enough of software company management games, but this one is not for me.  Visually it is very nice, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it.  The gameplay loop seems really poor and shallow (it is early access though!)  Despite there being hardly any moving parts the game can get really choppy.    The screenshots did their trick of getting me really excited for this game, but there's just not much to it.
Loved the game at first and still do want to play it. I got very far into the game and then i got error message and now it does not load after re install  I would like the money back
This game does not work at all. It can become good however, in it's current state, it's not. Please fix this game. It has potential as a concept. Problems i had  - You can invite yourself to your own game - The start screen is broken and overlays the lobby - The character does not spawn in - Physics is broken - The level is basically freecam - The quiz does not start
Quite ok game, if it wasn't for the fact you can't pass level 6 chapter1 and can therefore get no further in the game. You have to click and drag items from a pile, the drag isn't working at all, epic fail !  update...I managed to get past this level by carefully clicking on the obvious matches, then gradually picked em all off
This is hard to rate for me, since even though this looks like it might end up being a good game, this game suffers a major drawback I just can't look past.  The slowness of the text scrolling.  It is utter drudgery here.  So instead of focusing in on that I'm going to use my time to send a message to Crankage games to let you know what might improve a further game.  I)  Give us a full party of four characters, I really enjoyed that about MaP and QD only had a single character making it feel like there was something missing  II)  Do more worldbuilding.  MaP had quite a bit of worldbuilding put into it, and all your other titles seem to forget to do that.  It feels more than a bit bizzarre.  III)  Make sure to give the players the ability to speed up messages and sprint.  The sprint one isn't an issue in your current titles but I know some rpgmaker games where they forgot to give the player sprint and it makes the game drag.  IV)  Make sure your plot points don't contradict each other.  The ending for QD really irked me because of that.  Since he mentions at point like the next 30 years will be awful, while at the end it says they've only been married 6 months.  It makes no sense!
this game was bad, it did not go anywhere, have a good story line, and the ending was bad!!!!
The game is too linear and short. In fact the 5 screenshots on the store page almost show the entire game world. Unlike most other RPG-Maker games, there are close to no NPCs other than the ones that you need to complete the story. This would have made the game a bit more vivid.
played it on stream, what a shame.. never had such a boring stream either, it got to the point, that ive just fuckin offlined because of how uncomfortably stupid it came out, 2 hours of nothin i would say  i DONT recommend this.
cute game but lacking in content
man, i was so hyped for this game. but here's the deal: this game is like an unfinished side-project. there's so much that's missing.   have you ever played a map used to demonstrate a game at a conference like e3? It's like that. There's nothing more to the game than in the (extremely cool) trailer. in fact, there might be less.  you just spawn into the world, with the drawing menu open. It's impossible to close it and it takes up a quarter of the screen. The camera controls are like steering a ship, and you can just press jump as many times as you want to fly. There's no explanation of how to play the game. There's no other characters. You submit drawings by falling off the map. The game itself is visually much worse than the trailer. A lot of art used to promote the game has noise added to make the antialiased shapes and fontwork clash less with the noisy backgrounds of the game.  it's not like I'm new to playing short art games. I really, really loved library (https://store.steampowered.com/app/865270/LIBRARY/) and i am still not sure why
As much as I love the art and style I can't recommend art sqool. The original trailer makes it seem like there is more to what the game offers. Such as an A.I. that grades your work. Unfortunately the A.I. professor has no basis on the grades you get. You can draw the same thing twice and the grades will be different. Part of the "magic" was gone when I found this out, but it may be a commentary on art? I don't know.  The world is amazing but lonely. You are the only character there. I tried to push through and started to draw objects from the world, ignoring the prompts. While this was enjoyable the lack of story and progression just couldn't hold me. The controls and camera need lots of work. I could see a good bit of people getting motion sickness from it.   Get this if you want to escape and draw random things. If you want more than that I don't recommend it.
I went into this really excited but just felt let down. :( The game feels to me like style over substance. The art has initial visual impact and a unique point of view, but the environments actually aren't that fun to explore, and they get repetitive. Not to mention that the camera is jerky enough that I had to change it to an overhead view to move around. As a game, I regularly felt this would work the same if I was just given the full list of prompts and access to Photoshop — especially given that the scoring metrics don't really mean anything.   Finally, even if loneliness is a theme that the game wants to explore (at one point the avatar Froshmin [spoiler]calls his mom to say he misses her[/spoiler] ) I found myself wanting some NPCs like other students, for example, to set the scene and contribute dialogue with somebody that isn't your professor.   I think this game is fun if you're a skilled artist that wants the constraints of the limited digital tools. Otherwise, as far as I've seen, there's not much in the way of gameplay or story/character driving you forward.
The trailer for this made it look so quirky and fun, but there's really nothing to the game. The "neural net" professor just gives you random feedback for your scribbles, and the assignments are in random order, so there's no chance for say, personal or artistic development through the assignments themselves. Disappointed.
(See bottom for TL;DR)  I have a lot of respect for the artist. It's visual, bright and interesting to look at. But the gameplay has some serious flaws. What is displayed as a quirky concept is reskinned basic Unity coding. You jump repeatedly to fly. The collisions are iffy. Your character is clunky to control, and above all the camera is very hard to place. In a game where looking at your surroundings is key, this is a big issue.  I like the concept of having jam-like drawing concepts. It's a mechanic not often seen, and having new, unusual tools at your disposal really pushes you to be creative. Was it necessary to place all the drawing tools in such a way that it takes repeated backtracking to find them (keeping in mind the clunky controls and slow movement speed)? Is the migraine-tempting noise of the skybox important?  This is a game which should've been a demo or a free concept piece - the type of project before the artist met with a coder or team that had the strength to carry out what had been promised in the trailers.  TL;DR: Visually impressive. Fun assignments and prompts. Arduous and exhausting to explore. Half-baked execution. Doesn't live up to the hype.
Not worth it. Nauseating / epilepsy inducing sky of noise and poor production value disguised "this is an art style". No end goal, nor any real objectives. No actual neural network in this game either. This game is arbitrary and not good.
Honestly, I didn't realize from the stills and trailer how nauseating the static background was.  I wanted to get lost in this little game for an hour or so and barely made it 20 minutes.  I just couldn't look at the static sky for any longer (even just an option to make it solid.  PLEASE).  The aesthetic is SUPER fun and weird.  And I feel like there is a fun commentary on the overall subjective nature of grading and art making.  But there are definitely some gameplay mechanical issues I wish were different or explained more (such as interacting with the world, getting things graded and moving, which took me a second to even know I could move haha).  But I think as an idea, it's fun and weird.  Just not for my tired old eyes.
I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this game, but unfortunately there are quite a few things that fall short.   The positives:  beautiful environment, good music, and the tools that I've found are fun to draw with. Visually, it's really nice.  The cons: -First is player/camera control. They're linked, so if you look to the right, you also walk to the right, which makes some things awkward. For a game that puts you in an environment to look at stuff, it's really hard to actually look at stuff because the camera isn't independently controllable.  -From a game design standpoint, there are some concepts that could do with an introduction. First, there's no information on the controls, so I had to look on Twitter to figure out how to change the camera view (it's x), and after you finish your project you get graded on 4 parameters that aren't explained at all. I feel like the game could have more of a feeling of progression if there was a little "class" at the beginning or classes throughout the game that helped train you on the different parameters so you could get better grades. There's also no consequence for getting bad grades and no reward for getting good ones, which could be a statement in itself but that didn't feel like a purposeful choice. It just sort of feels unfinished. I also had no clue how to turn in my assignments and just threw myself off of the world to do so until I figured out you could enter some buildings. I actually made a single mark on the paper one time and accidentally fell off of the world, which got me a B score. If there was an in-game explanation of each of the parameters or assignments that directly and purposefully targeted those parameters the grading system would feel less arbitrary.   -On the minor gripes side, I would have liked to interact with other art sqool students. If they changed over time or said different things at different times, that could also help with the game's sense of progression. As it is, the main mechanic is introduced, and then that's about it.  Overall: Cute environment, nice character design, and great idea. Mechanics fall short in really disappointing ways. After about 15-20 minutes you realize that the progression of the game is entirely what you've seen.
This game seems really fun in videos and screenshots; however, it just really isn't. The game has very odd controls, including a bad camera. Also, the player is thrown into game-play with little introduction. The game also is also pretty buggy, making it difficult to actually play. It looks very quirky and like something I would enjoy, but due to these circumstances I just really couldn't play it.
I really wanted to enjoy this game. After opening it up and setting up the controls I started to struggle moving the character around comfortably. I noticed a lot of awkward camera movments and I would frequently attempt to move and suddenly be flung off the map. I set out to collect all the tools and color swatches but after struggling to even walk around with ease I just shut the game off. I'm really dissapointed.
It's always nice to see Julian Glander's art on my social media feeds - it's charming, looks great, is instantly recognizable, and unique.  I respect Glander a lot as an independent artist and content creator.  I truly believe that artists like Glander keep art vibrant and alive in the Internet era, which is part of what makes writing this review so difficult.  I generally don't like making heavy criticisms of these kinds of artists.  But the monetization of one's work - which I wholeheartedly support - does, I feel, open creators up to a higher level of critique.  ART SQOOL has Glander's brilliant signature aesthetic, the music is fairly great, and the humor is generally fairly good, but it falls short on gameplay - even as an experimental audiovisual experience.  It's unfortunate that an art game billing itself as having "assignments generated & graded by an A.I." actually has "assignments graded arbitrarily with no regard for what you've drawn."  Don't buy this under the impression that some program is going to actually analyze your art, because that certainly isn't the case.  And that's unfortunate, because I feel that the branding of the game - the selling point, in fact - conveys the opposite.  Sketchy advertising aside, there's no real desire to actually carry out the prompts the game gives you once you realize that the "A.I." is actually just throwing out a random score.  It's possible to see this when being handed a "D" or "F" grade - the professor sends you back out to campus to "try again," but a quick press of the undo button brings your old work back.  This allows you to re-submit the same work for a potential passing grade.  Sure, one could just do the prompts for one's own amusement, but they are often vague or difficult to the point of impossibility - usually as a joke.  While the humor lands every once in a while, this often just feels like the joke is at the artist's expense.  "Here's a vague challenge, draw something random and hope the A.I. picks a good letter this time."  One must also traverse the campus to find and unlock the various tools and colors.  This is neat at first, but the world quickly reveals itself as empty with no interactivity.  I actually became disinterested in finding all of the artist tools, and ended the game missing two of them.  Finishing the game requires the player to [spoiler]complete 50 prompts[/spoiler], and once that's done, the player is unceremoniously brought right to the menu screen.  No "you graduated ART SQOOL" or "you beat the game!"  Attempting to continue the save will drop the player back into the campus world, but with no sketch pad or prompts.  Sorry, no post-game free-draw mode.  This wasn't the only rough edge, either - footstep noises continue as one "walks" through the air, and occasionally the player may spawn without a pad to draw on.  There was the promise of something greater that was left unfulfilled in ART SQOOL - that, combined with some rough edges, on top of my rapidly deflated hype, really tore into me as the prompts continued.  I really wanted this game to be one of those special little experiences, but ended up with a bit of buyer's remorse instead.
I did not get mammoth sidekick and avatar
Poorly optimized game. Even at the very lowest settings (which look like you're playing an 80s game) I still got a lot of stutters. I really like the concept of managing a bus company, but unfortunately I had to refund due to the poor optimization.
Game is laggy, boring and for some stupid reason you need to go from A to B to A instead of just A to B like a normal coach service does, also the AI is mindless and will go out of their way to ruin your drive... Should Not Purchase
This game feels like a mobile game on PC. It is silly and the roads are narrow
do not buy, terrible controls and graphics is just shit even on epic (my computer can handle it) if i have it on low graphics it seems to lag more then epic for some reason and to many controls easy to forget i have played similer games like omsi 2 and that was much easier to play
Well... its not ETS, is 1.000.000 dollars short. I still want to give it a try.
Enjoyable to some extent, does not make full use of the powerful Unreal Engine 4, it's poorly optimized, bad pedestrian animations, driver's hands don't even seem to be touching the steering wheel when viewing from outside, no support for my plug&play steering wheel...also the basic MAN bus should be more high def, the rear upper lights for example are not even round, it's like poly's cost extra money or something, also who thought that extra busses should cost money for a 29,95 game should be fired, this game should be 9,95 at most as it currently sits. One purchase I do regret unfortunately.
Well what can I say about this game well its extremely un optimized im way above the recommended specs of the game the driving for the game takes a bit of getting used to the feel of GTA 4 Driving which isnt too bad thats only in the car the driving of the bus however isnt too bad game looks nice feel however runs like crap   wait for this game to be optimized so you can play it much more smoothly
Not working with Fanatec Wheel any good. Bad physics and the steering is awful. Im going back to the truck in ETS2
This is not a nice game
Hot garbage. Refunded,
This game is so bad, it's not optimised, i get like 30 fps all low settings with my gtx 1050 ti and it does not have H shifter support, hit me up if they add it so i can buy it again and if they optimise it
Horrible performance and overall much worse driving experience than ETS or ATS
I really wanted to give this a good review but once the Devs thought adding pay for DLC was more important than fixing their game i couldn't.  The game itself is just OK, it as potential but it's so repetitive, i wanted to be more involved with the management side of the game than the actual painful driving (It's awful) but even managing your staff isn't great, it's a very easy game in terms of growing your business, the money is easy to get which ruins the game completely.
Looks great, but controls are horrendous with no simple way to adjust sensitivity or anything. Very difficult to play on controller, look turning is slower than anything, and doesn't detect the Logitech G920 Wheel. Would request refund, but unable to as I've wasted more time than that messing with settings.
Overall it's ok... in the surface that is...   I'm not saying this isn't going to be good. i just don't think so yet.  Like the game is beautiful, if you forget the annoying motion blur, the bad graphics, the unalligned camera, the weird controls, the dead enveriment, the boring roads etc etc..   Please, my steering wheel and my POV have to be centered, otherwise disasters will happend!  There is a ton of stuff showing that this should have been a beta release or at least saying this is early access, because the only thing i found great? The support for my Logitech g920, that was ok... ok, not perfect.  When i think of tourist busses, i don't think i'll go around doing Bus Simulutor 2018 routes, i think highways, i think passangers doing their things, while i plan a route, enjoy a nice ride through Europe etc. I didn't get that...
awful controls, cant use mouse in cockpit to click buttons on dash, controls response in vehicles is just awful. This is like something from 2005 not 2019. FPS and optimisation is shocking on a reasonable pc. i7 6700k, 1080ti
crap
great concept but Not cool. sound qaulity poor controles are clonky and this might as well bean a early access game
Bad sound and totally unplayable controls, the guy responsible for the UI and controls must be on heavy substances. Gfx is what you would expect from a niche sim like this but worse irl than it looks on youtube or screenshots. Could have been fun hence everyting you can do if it was playable, but I realized right away that this was refund fodder, especially for THAT price!
READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This game is bad grafic, bad stearing, bad acc and bad breaking, if you go under budget in the tutorial then you got to start all over, the tutorial is around 1,5 hours and not worth trying, i really hope for the makers that they improve on this game, becouse the idea of the game is great, meyby it just wasnt TML studios that should have made come up with it. 
just got this game have not played 10 min yet and game has crashed twice, gaming contorller will not work as well not worth the 29.99 i spent
nothing, NOTHING like the screenshots. Refund has been requested.
did not like would not play for me and kept crashing the second time i installed this i kept saying running but the game would not play for me i will not recommend this to my freinds 
I personally thing that this game is very difficult to control, I have tried control it with my XBOX controller, and via the keyboard. it really had and annoying control system that you have to tweek, wven then it doesn't work very well. I am very sorry to say this but it just isn't that easy to control. They really need to take a leaf out of SCS software.   I don't recomend this game to anyone.
claiming a refund after 19 minutes, terrible
i think... it is good.. but... very bad in controll in car
TLDR Confusing and just read the legit bad reviews with a description...
nott g ood
Sadly the game is not at a point where it can be usable. It is a new release and probably will take weeks or months of patches to get it right.  The stuttering while playing is insane, on a high end machine. Did change settings various times but it dind't help. The driving model of the car is like a bus with the retarder; you lift your foot from the accelerator, the car stops on a dime. Handling is also borderline ridiculous. Same goes for the bus; although it is better, considering that it is very similar to Fernbus. So if you didn't like Fernbus model, don't even bother with this.  I didn't check the rest of the game; since 80% of the game is based on driving; and driving is not viable nor fun. Watch videos online; although if your main point is to drive a bus in a bus driving game, and the driving is not good enough for a simulation, I am not sure what are you looking for.  Graphics is OK; but it is not enough to sell a simulator. I tried to see if the concerns I had about this game were in fact there, and sadly I can't recommend this game yet. Maybe in few months or years; can't say. For now it is not up to par for sure. Wait and see if the game evolve and improve.
Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many bugs.
Had a problem with the menu were it would go off the screen so I could not click on it so made the game unusable.  I got zero responce from steam forms I got zero responce sending a ticket to TML support I got zero responce from the TML support forums   These companys should be removed from steam for selling broken products with zero support.  Edit 20 Dec  Although this issue has been addressed above with the opt in beta the support itself for a new customer is below one star, I still wouldn't recommend the product due it being so poorly optimised even on my higher end rig,  Jumps around between 35 - 46 fps and the lag makes it sometimes unplayable  I7 - 6700k 4.2Ghz GTX 980 Ti 32 GB ram I have installed TBS on the fastest M.2 SSD with the above result.
I found a bug. When I was driving the bus, it suddenly ran out of fuel and I can still drive it. But the engin was off.
Good concept, poor execution
The controls on the game are just garbage, the car drives like its constantly on ice. The default steering is WAYYYYY to fucking fast. Don't like it that fast? Good luck changing it in the settings, learning Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is probably easier than that. 4 options in steering settings;  Min Max Curve Value Fade Time.  WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!?!  'Steering Sensitivity' would've made much more sense.
İlk olarak fiyattan başlamak istiyorum Türkiye olarak s*kil... öhöm dalgalı kur nedeniyle yayımcı kura bağlı olarak oyunun fiyatlandırmasını yapıyor artı olarak oyunun asıl fiyatı 105 tl + kdv ile 125 tl ediyor. Optimizasyon problemi yine son gaz devam bazen kaplamalar yüklenmiyor ancak bu sorun fernbus ta da vardı sonra düzelttiler. Umarım optimizasyon düzelir diyecem ancak aynısını Fernbus için de dedim kaç yıl bekledik sonuç yok. Sonuç olarak benim gibi man hayranıysanız, pc niz orta sengmentli ise, çevre herçekten hoş yaşam olduğu belli görmek isterseniz bu oyunu alın. Asla hiçbir oyuna çöp demem diyene de karşı çıkarım. Ne olursa olsun emek var. Çok simülasyon manyağı ve benim gibi MAN hayranı iseniz alın aksi takdirde asla memnun kalmassınız. Şimdi Fernbus u tavsiye etmiştim çünkü ümitliydim. Artık o ümit yok herşeyi göze alarak aldım bu oyunu ama ümit 0 olduğundan tavsiye etmicem bu sefer. :D :D
poor optimisation, no value for money. Don't download this game even its cracker version
First of all I must to say that I liked this game after 20+ hours. But I not recommend to buy it now and for full price, and that's why: This is Fernbus Simultator relocated on new map, some new features were added as well as some new bugs. But playing this game I feel that the aim of developers was just to get more money. And as more time I'm spending in this game than this feeling gets stonger. There a lot of minor bugs and imperfections that makes impression really bad. There is nice economical model, you can really can feel yourself as owner of small bus company.  But the game has so many points that makes you feel that you have bought half-maded product: - Optimization is really bad. On my powerfull PC (I7-7700 4.2GHz, 32Gb memory and GTX1080 8Gb) on high settings it running 25-30 FPS maximum. - Passengers [b]sometimes[/b] teleporting into the bus, like it was in Fernbis Simulator. - Ugly textures and models of buildings and people. A lot of clones. Developers are you serious? It's end of 2018. - Voices and radio just copied from Fernbus . Developers you are too lazy to record spanish voices? - Damages doesn't affect anything. You can drive the bus with 100% damaged body, damaged lights and indicators are working perfecly. - Yes, you can drive not only the buses, but cars have terrible controls, you can't refuel it etc. I'm repeat myself it's end of 2018, developers you have powerful game engine "Unreal Engine 4", but you can't use it powers and make this!  This game looks like a Early Access, but it sells for full price. If you're fan of those type of games I'd recommend to wait for discounts or bug fixes and finishing the game befoure you buy it.
dont even know what to say about it   1-10 looks like a bad sequal of fernbus
游戏优化真的很差，而且BUG太多，尤其是在任务中，一趟行程全部跑完了，到终点以后就没提示了，导航也没有提示，游戏也没有提示，压根现在都接不了订单。
Yes it may be more realistic in terms of managing a business than fernbus but if you just want to drive a bus and enjoy driving your better off with fernbus
I have played the game for around an hour and a half and can't recommend it at it's current state. I love all kind of simulations but after playing this i found myself back in OMSI 2. Keep your pennies for say LOTUS perhaps in full release or even now to help developer's. Graghics pop in and out when you are cm's from the object its jittery now and again and the speed is all over the place. I did however enjoy the tutorial, a good idea. It reminds me of Bus and Cable car simulator has the same vibes. But alot of work still needs done. I have all settings maxed at epic and it makes no difference whatsoever. I had faith that TML would cling back some wrong doings but with this product its rushed even though we had TWO delays as the had to work on bugs and fixes and STILL its a hunk of junk. I have lost faith in TML and wonder what THE BUS will bring. I hope they learn from these mistakes instead of pushing out rushed money grabbing, fast buck products.
I don't have much time in the game, but I have enough I feel to give it a pretty honest review, because the mechanics aren't gonna change as I progress further, and that's where this game falls apart.  While I sincerely appreciate the business aspect that TML Studios inserted into this game, it is a BUS SIMULATOR, and therefore the focus should be on driving mechanics (physics, controls, etc.).  The bus does not drive like a bus, but more like a car.  And the SUV in the game drives like a toy, I don't even know where to start with that.  Some of this might be able to be alleviated if TML had just added more ability to tweak the controls in the settings.  However, you cannot adjust brake intensity, deadzones, etc.  Also, the AI is terrible.  They turn in front of you last minute and don't give you enough room to pull out (the roads are very tight on the island and you need to swing into the oncoming lane to turn most of the time).  All in all the game feels very...fake at this time.  However, even though I have to give it a negative review right now, I'm HOPING that TML and the community will upgrade the game through updates and mods.  This game has so much potential.  If the physics can be improved, the AI can be fixed and the numerous bugs fleshed out, I believe this game could be good if not great.  As for me, I played it too long to request a refund.  So I'll just keep it in my library and come back to it in a year or so to see if anything's changed.  I wouldn't be too discouraged from purchasing this game, however, as it's NOT horrible.  But I would get it on sale.  This game is worth, in its current state, $10-$15.
Just a day old, i get it there will be bugs, but this game has the same issues fernbus did when it came out. With a 2hr tutorial i had to restart 3x because if you do anything out of order like skip one day then on to the next instead of two straight. The game will stare blank at you and leaves ya stuck with an objective you cant complete because its bugged. Game has alot of potential but with all the bugs it has consuming soo much of your time will frustrate anyone. 3hrs and some change to only do 1/4 of the tutorial 3 times. So i wont recommend it in its current state and price.
Horrible controls and horrible graphìcs
Not good
So not worth the time and effort.. and espically the £27 price tag: Most of the interactions are "Currently Disabled" you drive pointless routes to start with. Xbox Controllers disconnect during driving at high speeds. During the opening title the video was lagging and look like a 5 year old made it. I've had enough of single player Aerosoft Titles. In the modern age where multiplayer is key and none of these games: Tourist Bus Simulator / Fernbus Simulator are MP. I prefer: Bus Simulator 2018 over this title and is completely pointless in buying.
Disappointing – First impressions didn't grab me and there were too many things which pecked my head that show lack of attention to detail or lack of care on behalf of the developer.  I was looking forward to exploring the island in the car but the physics on that are laughable, its more like a supermarket trolley than a car – giving us only the same default coaches as Fernbus plus one extra badly produced vehicle isn't impressive.  Graphics-wise its a mixed bag, it does look good on the surface but there are a lot of objects which have been thrown in and not placed correctly, plenty of floating cars and misplaced objects.  There are even 5 nice rocks floating a metre off the ground in the yard which is where you spend a lot of time in the early game.  The satnav issues mentioned by beta testers on their streams seem to be fixed so its picking more sensible routes now.  The game shows a lot of promise, however as it is at the moment I can't recommend it – if the car physics are fixed and there are other improvements to floating cars/objects then I might revisit it in the future.  The reason I've had it refunded for the time-being is that there were a lot of promises made by TML about fixing issues and adding new features in Fernbus but over 2 years on and things such as the modding tools and passengers walking onto the coach aren't implemented.  For Fernbus I gave them the benefit of the doubt and they didn't deliver so this time I'm playing it safe – one to revisit if they pull their finger out and make it the game it could be but that doesn't seem to be TMLs strong point.
this game i do not reommand FPS bad bus simulator 18 better
Got as far as getting in the car then nothing. Not worth the £27. I'll await a patch
Game is terrible shitty grapichs tutorial of 90 mins refunded the game
I really wanted to enjoy this game, sadly it wasn't to be so. Over two hours into the tutorial (yes, the tutorial took over two hours to complete) and I got a game breaking bug when being introduced to fast travel. I tried reloading the save, reloading the game, fast travelling to different places but the only way to have fixed it would have been to start the tutorial again which after over two hours I was not going to repeat. If this game actually gets fixed notably then maybe I will give it another shot later down the line but as it is, this is the last TML-Studios game I'll be purchasing. I'm bored of the release day bugs and games with SO much potential but ultimately they never get fixed.   This game has all the bugs and optimisation issues of Fernbus but adds to them tenfold. Sorry TML, you've lost one more customer.
A game for 2018 should be optimized to a standard where a computer with a 1070ti and i7 with 16gb ram should be able to run at least relatively well. Nope, this is not the case and to anyone with a high end PC, you will be disapointed at how it runs. No change from fernbus, never refunded a game quicker with absolute disappointment.
Let me start by saying I love games like these. However, this game is horrible. The graphics are nothing like the screenshots even on the highest setting. The driving is terrible which is sad considering this is a driving game.  The music is just god aweful. It has opening credits and cutscene that can't be skipped they take about 10 minutes and replay whenever you open the game. I'm not sure if this game gets better later on. I'm not trying to knock down the company this is just a consumer warning. I played 47 minutes and unlocked all of the achivements.
Well I can't say anything about this game, except when it loads up, I pick a male, input a name, select a level of play, then thats it just a black screen, I have been waiting a few weeks for this so I am annoyed that it's not working :(
horrible controlls, horrible graphics even on ultra, not worth 30% of the price asked Worse games based on Unreal engine I'w ever played including Fernbus Simulator Refund please! nothing like screenshots
Poor quality game :(  Upd: Most dumb AI I've ever seen in games. Guys from TML please call to guys from SCS Software. Upd2: This game has framdrops from 60 to 20 even on low settings (1070ti, SSD, i7, 16Gb). NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM TML!
They say it works on Linux, but Developers didn't even Upload files for Linux Don't buy
Done with this company.  Its not a game. Its an editor (the thing you used to get 4 Free during wc3 times)  And then they charge you 11€ For some cosmetics (you could Freely implement in wc3 times).  I was hoping maybe in years time they Fix "the game" but nope. It's just cosmetics For 11€ I can make in a week time.  *uck you sincerely.
Unacceptable "DLC" pack. As someone who has put hundreds of hours into this game, it goes without saying that I adore building parks. I am the kind of player who makes intricate buildings with hundreds of pieces, spending hours on each one. For me this pack is a joke.  It adds numerous new building sets like "Bavarian" and "Classic" - these packs are INCOMPLETE, so much so its laughable. They have maybe 5 different types of walls, but have NO roof pieces for these sets, meaning youll have to mismatch roof pieces from other building themes that WONT look good, making the entire suite of building sets entirely useless.   The "Victorian" set is even more of a joke, it has only a doorway wall piece and a couple window wall pieces. Not only does it also lack a roof, but it doesnt even have plain walls which makes it another useless set. Unless you want to make some asinine looking building with windows covering every square inch, you wont be able to use it. No wall add-ons either.  After you realize you wont feasibly be able to use these building packs in any cohesive or sane way, your left with a meager TWO rides you can place. Thats it. For ten bucks I feel absolutely ripped off. Store description is intentionally misleading and these morally bankrupt business practices disgust me quite frankly.
Not good at all.  Fundamentally, this should be a great DLC. Unfortunately, Frontier bit of a little more than they could chew. Due to the large amount of scenery, the rides here are not really that innovative. They aren’t completely unoriginal, per se, but they don’t justify the price tag.  More problematic, however, is the fact that none of the countries have enough scenery to make them special. While there is a good amount of scenery overall, there is a drought of scenery for each individual country, likely because Frontier attempted to make scenery for ten different countries. This makes it difficult to make anything unique for Germany or Italy, for example, because you are hindered by a severe lack of options
I only bought this Pack for the new Food Shop Brands. for the rest, i think i will never use anything form this pack again.  But those food shop brands are very creative!  i will only recommend this Pack for those who really love to have everything in their game and those who really love these foods, otherwise you should probably skip it.  and BTW whould the name "World Cutures Pack" not have been a better name for it?
I have purchased all expansion packs in order to support Frontier in developing my all time favorite game. Unfortunately this pack falls short in delivering any refreshing changes one would expect from an expansion pack.   The new building pieces are about to be made obsolete by the introduction of the theme makers toolkit. I can't help but think that Frontiers intention was to set a stylistic theme with the world's fair pack that other artists would then contribute to. However I object to using my money to do this. The building pieces should have been bundled free with the release of the toolkit.  The shops are an ok addition along with the theme music.  The biggest let down in this pack is the rides, or lack of. It's nice to see the booster bikes in action. I can see them fitting into a smaller park although I have never ridden one. There aren't many in the world and I would have expected one of the more glaring omissions to be replace this one.   The people mover will satisfy hardcore Disney fans but I tried to add this ride to my current park and ended up ripping it out again due to it's glaring obscurity. A chairlift would have been a much more sensible and usable addition.  The other packs on offer add some kind of step change in the gameplay that the world's fair pack cannot. Due to the 'sweep the floor' feeling of this expansion, I do not recommend it.
Garbage, it's Steam stealing your money. None of the content will show in game. When you try to get help, Steam for tell you to get support from Fronteir, who will ignore you.
DLC updates have been including less and less rides. With this update you only get one transport ride (A very limited use transport ride at that). And 1 coaster (PC you can seperate it under two different names but in reality they are the same ride with different looking trains.   The shops were a nice addition but the scenery included wasn't worth it for what we get. With only two rides in this expensive pack I will definatly be hesitating when they realease the next one.
I am really underwhelmed and disappointed every time I purchase a DLC. I am still expecting core changes. I still want more career challenges. This was the last DLC I will ever purchase...I want to support the team but this is ridiculous.
What a desappointment. I was fascinated by Planet Coaster, its mechanisms, its graphics but for the DLC ... Too bad. € 11 for so little content? It was already the same for the vintage pack and the others. I find it really sad when you have a good game, a beautiful community and you do that sort of thing afterwards. This is the last time I give you money for a DLC until you become aware of this problem. Next time, I will wait to see the positive reviews of other players. You do not listen to the players, you are stubborn.
oh GREAT another DLC full of material to cram into an already low Frame Rate game. Im not impressed. How about fixing the low FPS problem that plagues this game so we can enjoy using all this extra DLC. I've simple lost interest.
This DLC is... rushed let's face it... the different themes are poor in terms of building sets and the new scenery's proportions is absurd... i can't really talk about the managing aspect because i play this game for the builging part only... No new flat rides and only two roller coaters that look just the same :/ i don't think it's worth 10$ to be honest...
Purchased the DLC however it has only worked for Tourist Bus Simulator and not Fernbus Simulator. I thought it was supposed to work with both?

我什么都不懂。
[h1]follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews[/h1]  I was attracted to this game because the character reminded me of chakan the forever man on megadrive. It turns out the sprite in the promo video was actually ripped from chakan (it has been replaced since). There are possibly more graphics borrowed from other places.  The game didn't start from steam because of a bug. I had to start it from outside steam, and then the menu doesn't appear unless you press "enter", then there is no explnation or ways to change the controls. Once you manage to play, the levels are almost empty and the rare enemies have really simplistic patterns. You just walk until you find keys to unlock  new areas.   If you're still tempted to buy, take a look at the game's discussions first.
This game, wich seemed to have so much potential, is not worth the price tag.  The sun constantly turns off and on, and many of the features advertising are lacking.  This isn't strange enough to warant exploration.  twitch.tv/theredkestrel
It's not bad, but it's not what I expected. I had some notable problems playing this with Oculus Rift.   The look sensitivity was way too high, which creates motion sickness.   The tutorial screens currently don't show Oculus controls. Both controllers are required to dock but the instructions say that only one controller is required. Took a while to figure out why I couldn't translate the command module. I still don't know how to perform the lunar descent: the controls don't seem to do anything.  If you're not sitting perfectly still in the center of your play area, your head will be outside of your space suit or even outside of the space craft.  I was also hoping to see more parts of the mission, like the lunar capture burn, re-docking with the command module after lunar ascent, crew transfer, etc. But overall it was a satisfying experience and quite cinematic.  I got it on sale and it was worth the experience to me. But until the over-sensitivity and Oculus controls are patched, my recommendation is 👎.
I want to enjoy it, lord knows I do; but there seems to be a conflicting issue with Oculus support throughout the entire experience. There doesn't seem to be any sort of means to reset your head-tracking; and thus much of the experience is thrown out the airlock and you're forced to stand up out of your chair and try and find the proper position to line up with the astronaut's neck...  if that wasn't immersion breaking enough; now take into account that STEAM specifically states on here that it does allow Oculus Support, but than goes onto only showing VIVE controls, there-by making it near impossible to finish the interactive portions effectively...  I want to love this 'experience', I really do, but until they can make effective changes to allow all forms of gameplay; I'm going to have to say no to this one; much to my dismay... it's such a shame really, all in all its a beautifully told experience. If only I could actually see it comfortably; instead of the vision fixed on the outside of the craft... :c
Worst VR game I've played, head movements are faster in game then your IRL head movements. You look down at your floor and you are looking at the wall behind you.
Here I am, all excited to see the Apollo 11 experience which I already saw Apollo 11 VR, in HD only to see a Low Res version which is unviewable!  (at least for HTC Vive Pro)  Come on guys!!!!  And I had to pay for this????
Several issues completely ruin imersion that could be so easy to fix, I'm bamboozled as to how they made it into the release build.
It's boring, pointless and repetitive. If I'd known it was just about fixing a video recorder I wouldn't have bothered.
"Anime Pantsu Detective" check this before buying this "game"
If you dont care for making dinos fight, then this is the worst.
not worth unless its $5 or less.
GREED AND LITTLE ADDED
Too shallow, that's it. Nice 2 dinos, 3 hybrids and 2 new (small) locations. Story was nice but it went nowhere.  Once again to everything about this game - MORE, BIGGER, MORE + not lazy.
The additional content is good in particular the new genes and research such as being able to alter your dinosaurs social needs or enclosure size.  BUT the actual Island and its mission is so boring you spend most of your time just waiting for one dinosaur to be hatched and then you need to wait another 20 mins to raise money for the next one and god help you if you make a mistake and need to start over..   The level design is not challenging it is just mundane and poorly executed but the rewards do have potential but just feel I could be playing a challenge map or building an exciting park
it really glitch after when i hatching the spinorap, because when i go to my autosave it starts when the ceratosaurus died and spino specimen is gonna teleport! So curse u JWE: secrets of dr wu!
Content wise it's "okay" i guess even though it feels like it should have been in the base game considering the base games price and rehashed animations, I only bought it for the 2 extra islands since we still can't get better landscaping tools or a custom island creator. Speaking of price tags it's still got place holder info in certain subtitle segments "i.e. "Voiceover_intro_sfx - in place of the actual subtitles, not what I expect from a 15$ dlc for a full AAA price tagged product, that alone shows incompetency in my eyes. If you MUST have more in your game grab it I guess but I on a personal level wouldn't recommend it. Your money may be better spent elsewhere till they get thier act together. I can however say I'll no longer be supporting frontier until then.
The DLC is NOT worth this much money.  There are only 2 extra islands map things, and 3 hybrids.  > Long neck thing Ankly-o-whatever - Pretty okay, actually in terms of usefullness and looks, is the best hybrid of all.  >Stegoceratops - Frankly useless, the rating is so low, and it looks rather unintresting. I would never makes this for an actual serious playthrough.  > Spinoraptor - Honestly the one I was hoping would be the best. They made it only slightly taller than an actual raptor, and some off orange color for some reason? It looks like puddy throwup. Which I guess wouldn't even be all that bad, but it only has a base livespan of 17. Which is god-awful and short. -------- Story  The story started off good, but then faded away on the second island. The whole line about "Work alongside the Divisions, while secretly answering to Dr. Wu. Earn his trust to gain access to new dig sites and bring to life five new dinosaurs, three of them being Dr. Wu’s hybrids. " is kinda bullshit. It makes it sound like theres more than there already is.  You get two new places to go. That's it. The hybrids suck. The other two dinos are eh. The troodons are where it's at though. I love making those things. They use some strange venom to kill dinos. That's the best part out of all this dlc.  Back to the story, it's barebones. Basically  Dr. Wu : "We're going to make some hybrids because dinosaurs are cool, and you really can't say no"  The Divisions (for like a single island and then it's never brought up again) : "Why do you break everything? Oh wait Dr. Wu told you to do it. Okay man."  What the hell was the point of "secretly working alongside Dr.Wu", if every fucking time I do something, Dr. Wu comes out and says "HE WAS WORKING FOR ME!!!!!!" It loses all build up. This could have been such a better storyline.   A good way for this story to go would be ---------- Story - Secretly mess up all the division's missions for Dr. Wu because "research" - Get research for hybrids on the way. - Divisions are confused and suspicous. Second island - You do the same thing, mess up their missions (add missions on that island or something) - You make hybrids under Dr. Wu's orders. - They eventually figure it out. - The divisions get so mad, they sabatoge your entire park with every sabatoge. (Gates, power, sick dinos, etc) - You have to save the whole park, etc etc. ---------------- At least anything better than that barebone sorry excuse you sold me.   -------------------- Bugs  Holy shit. So many bugs.  I played the story with few bugs, other than the ones in my actual review for the entire game.  My game magically only crashes in the DLC maps.  The fucking subtitling is awful. I barely got any pop ups for the characters talking. Sometimes I would get random audio logs with unsubtitled audio. You lazy dick-heads, how did you NOT fucking notice this. IT'S IN YOUR FIRST FUCKING DLC MISSION. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1611415707 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1611198357 Just two of the many examples.  ---------------------------  I honestly cannot beleive I paid money for this. If I could get a refund I would.  It's buggy, lackluster, uninspired, bad story, the devs don't care, and a giant waste of money.
good dlc takes 20 hrs to unlock
Cool, but overpriced.  The DLC comes with five new Dinosaurs, most of which have unique and interesting characteristics. Also, the DLC comes with a lengthy campaign. On the surface it seems like this DLC would be worth $15- but it isn’t. Let me explain why.   The base game succeeded in many ways. The game came with many dinosaur species, a large number of dinosaur skins, and many ways to edit the genes and stats of your dinosaurs. In addition, it came with a lengthy single-player campaign.   The base game failed in many other ways. It has a severe lack of exhibit and park customization options, a small number of buildings, and an unacceptably small number of actual ways for your guests to view the many dinosaurs (the base game only has four different attractions). This is where the DLC fails. It decides to add content to areas where the base game already has enough content and ignores areas where the base game needs improvement.   Furthermore, the first three-quarters of the DLC campaign is rather repetitive and too similar to the already lengthy base game campaign. It is far too much of a slog to get to the more original, fun, last few hours of DLC.    If the DLC was 9.99 or lower, I might give it a hesitant thumb up. $15.99 is just out of this DLC’s price range.
Unfortunitly I can't give this content a positive review. You can only play the content in the campaign not in the challange mode which is a core game mode. So bassicly this is a waste of money for those who play the game for the challange mode, but not interested in the campaign.  I logged a support ticket, but the support team was simply unwilling to help.
Pros: The real dinosaurs are cool, even the spinoraptor is cool. The added stress and population control genes are a nice addition.  Cons: Story involves a lot of waiting. Its about 90% just waiting for long cooldown dinosaurs to pop out of the oven. That comes on top of the whole thing supposedly being a dark plot, but the music and atmosphere just don't match up. The Environmental genes do squat. the Two other hybrids leave a lot to be desired.   Over all I would wait for this to go on sale. 8 bucks would be the sweet spot for me.
I was going back and forth a lot on wether to leave a positive or a negative. It starts out strong but starts to fall apart. To make it brief:  Simply put, the DLC adds a lot of content the base game should have had. So while I feel like player -should- have the dlc, they shouldn't have had to pay for it, or at least as much. One of the two new islands you get is actually a really nice addition, it feels like a new adventure. The second locks you into doing super time consuming, particular missions where if you fail, you have to restart.   Without spoiling, a mission might be 'make three dinosaurs that take a really long time to make, load them up with gene mods so you have to take the increased viability option, preventing faster hatching, and then have them fight other strong dinosaurs. If they lose the turn based combat system (which usually happens because your mission dinosaur just sits there and lets itself be killed instead of attacking) you have to restart the mission from the beggining.  Aside from that, the new dinosaurs are pretty meh. Troodon is neat but the model and skins aren't amazing, the new animations it gets are nice though. Olorotitan is just another hadrosaur, pretty but not much else going on. The hybrids are all pretty meh, Stegoceratops is very cartoony looking, Spinoraptor just looks like a big velociraptor, and the Ankylodocus not only looks derpy but also looks like it could be a real dinosaur (The dinopedia even states this!)   So over all, lots of nice stuff but they shouldn't have put the gene parts in a dlc, it should have been added to the base game. The DLC starts strong but the infuriating end and relative lack of content mean I can't really reccomend picking this up for any more than 5.99 or so.
still not worth 15Euro  hmm this game is failing big time  every body wanna have this game to be like Planet coaster but nooooo  the DEv will not make that way
15 dollars for stuff that should've been in the game at launch 6 months ago for a game that already has 0 depth.   https://youtu.be/uuL6cJPz3Nk  I mean, the content is nice but it's not even remotely worth the price. Save your money.   Oh, BTW: Since you have to grind for hours to get the DLC's content, that means if you aren't satisfied with everything then there's no way to get a refund.
Can't really agree with this DLC. Not only should this have been in the game from launch, they are putting a pricetag on it. Not a lot of variety at all in the dino's they offer. People may praise frontier for staying and "working" on the game, and continuing to offer updates, but these updates are not what we asked for and not only that but so lackluster that it clearly should have been released with the game on launch, maybe then people would stop complaining about the games poor design and lack of customizablity options and content (doubt).  As a fan of the series I bought the DLC, and i can't recommend the purchase of it unless jurassic park is one of your favorites and want that healthy dose of nostalgia.
Get it in bundle with main game or on some sale - it adds about 30 minutes quest with new puppet to control - it's not much for a DLC tbh.

not worth it
Cheap assets from the Unity store re-packaged to try to rip people off.
I have no clue what to do. I've literally pressed every button on my keyboard and mouse, I can't seem to make any progress. I was able to buy workers and assign them to build a sawmill and whatever other mill it said I needed to build... but it's already showing I don't have resources to finish those buildings? However, as far as I can tell the only way to gather resources is using those buildings. So... how is that supposed to work? Furthermore, I can't move the camera at all... and there is no menu option to view controls nor is their a guide provided on steam. This feels completely dead in the water. I'm going to go back in and try to continue figuring things out, but until some sort of explanation or guidance is provided this game is a hard pass from me. Is this game listed in early access? It should be if it isn't. This is a horrible user experience. I plan on refunding if I can't get some answers here.  --Update--  So it appears that despite the game saying I don't have the resources available I was able to successfully build the windmill ... while I was logged out writing this original review its progress meter filled. So essentially this looks like a really bad click and wait game with no real guidance on what to do or what your goal is. It's definitely not a finished product and should be listed as early access if nothing else.  One other big evidence that this game is unfinished... there is no way to "delete" your character/account/save? Idk what you would call it because the game doesn't say. So effectively, you cannot restart. You're stuck with whatever first game entry you've created. I'm asking for a refund now. This was an extremely misleading entry in the steam store.
dont do it,its a trap
This is a scam, You get in, no tutorial or explanation on how anything works. The camera is at some weird angle in the distance, you cant move it, and it's inverted, There is no controls menu or options, just help and exit. I have no clue how to do anything, and the screen shots are very misleading, If you can even ever get to a point where you get to fight, I highly doubt you'd get to see any models actually fighting, I think you'd just be stuck in your villiage at a weird angle unable to do anything tbh. 0/10 would not recommend.
For those who are trying to figure out what this game is: a very low-production-value mobile-style timers-to-get-to-the-timers game. There is no tutorial. The UI made my eyes bleed. I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the assets are unity store flips based on how good the models look versus how terrible the rest of the game looks. I have no idea how anything works and I don't have the patience to work it out because this game charges money for a worse experience than mobile games.  Refunding and stay away. Just another case of crap games steam just pushes onto the store without a second glance.
Its kinda fun, i understand its still in development. i beat it in about a hour and a half, but after that there isin't much to do but replay the levels.
Terrible.  Unplayable.  Don't waste your money.
So far a huge meh. It's a puzzle game with "hitman" elements. So far it is boring.  The graphics are not textured for the most part, very plain and shiny.  The gameplay is limited to Kill X and Y. X I walk up from behind and I am presented with "Snap Neck." To kill Y I walk around until I find an object that say, "interact." Next mission. Rinse and repeat.
should cost 2 bucks not 12
Eh, only buy it if you desperately want more Overload in your life. The community developers involved get 50% of the money. That's right, this is content made by fans using the free mapping tools, integrated into the game and then sold as DLC. Might seem like some Bethesda type bs the devs are pulling here, but the maps are actually available for free too, if you care to download them manually. Those won't have leaderboards and other online stuff supported though.  The campaign levels have quite the difficulty spike straight off the bat, which would've been fine, if only I had my weapons and ship upgrades. The status of your ship and weapons from the original Cronus Frontier campaign sadly don't carry over - this would've been also fine, but as you would expect from community made maps patched together into a small campaign, they don't exactly have the pacing and polish.  It would be also nice to get some extra save slots for the new campaign. I wanted more for the Cronus campaign too anyways. I don't want to overwrite the cronus campaign saves damn it, I'm already on Insane+ :/ Devs pls.  Challange maps tho... those are awesome. Sadly still no coop, not even for the challenge mode, which is long overdue if you ask me. I'm not into soloing the challenge mode much, so that's why I don't recommend.
I can't make out with/gain items from the spittoon. What the heck actually. I haven't been this infuriated since the time Disney hijacked Stan Lee's Twitter.
Why's Yang so scuffed niba?
I was really looking forward to the timeskip outfits, but this was pretty dissapointing. Ruby, Blake, and Yang look alright aside from textures being a little fuzzy and Blake's ears being unreasonably large. Weiss seems to have less that half the texture resolution of the other three, her face looks like some weird doll version of her, and her inside hair textures (next to her face) look like they're missing or broken. With Jaune they didn't even bother changing his sword and shield. Overall, I'm just really dissapointed with the work that obviously didn't go into this.
I get the feeling that whoever wrote this was drunk out of their mind the entire time.
this is.... really a scary scary game

Terrible. Don't waste your money on this game.
This game is absolute rubbish!  You start off sexting momo and she comes over to netflix and chill, only to try and kill you!! You are forced to collect a bunch of crap and call the police until they show up, and once they show up, about 5 more momos come and kill you. There is no ending or way to win so save your $2..
If your monitor has ghosting issues, or just inst that great some of the game modes are just unplayable.
This always gives me a [i]bad time.[/i]  [spoiler]Get it?[/spoiler]
this game copied undertale
Wow you guys could try a lot harder then that to scare me like really the jump scares are just not even worth trying and things getting thrown at you like come on it's like you notice it but who cares.
No.  Here is what you'll get if you purchase this game:  - A feeling of nausea due to motion blur you cannot turn off in the settings - A game that has ZERO choice, is dark as hell, and can be fully beat in about ten minutes - No ability to crouch, jump, or run, even though the settings say those keys work, they do not - A game that forces you to move at a snails pace, so that it will take you a full ten minues to beat - A game that isn't scary in the slightest - A game made up of free assets and annoying sound effects  Here's my First Play on Launch Day full playthrough and review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Pu8ImTTUw&feature=youtu.be Just a quick money grab low effort mess of free assets and all of two lame jump scares.  Making a game super dark, move super slow, and throwing free asset chairs at the player is NOT "scary", sorry dev.  If you want a much better low budget horror game, look at Wick, Boogeyman, and Into the Gloom on Steam, all of which are at least 100 times better than this low effort and heartless mess of assets and cheap jump scares with the absolute dumbest ending I've ever seen in a game like this.  0 out of 10, avoid unless you want to feel sick to your stomach for no reason at all.  * Note:  My review was the first review for this game posted for this game
New/more factions were needed because the size of the map has increased and the game is finally well enough optimized to properly support more NPC factions, but this is a very low effort attempt at dealing with this. It's almost insulting.
DO NOT BUY!!!  This DLC crashes the game at the very start if you include any of the new Factions, and, although I asked for help to the developers, mentioning I had found many similar complaints from other customers, they limited themselves to send me a useless FAQ which said that they wouldn't do anything (?!).  I'm never again buying anything from them because of their lousy attitude!
Should had been just free because let's face it - it's just a promotion.
I purchased this product, installed it, and played it for 0.8 seconds, all for the sole purpose of downvoting it. For spite!  That's correct, my review is based on spite, and spite was worth the $5.39 purchase price. Sure, I'll have a karma hit to balance out, but it's not quite baby from a burning building level. Perhaps if I view one cat video and give some aging spinster a free view we can call it even. Although a quick glance at the content and I may be doing some a favour...  While I have no specific objections to stupid, jokey content that must have seemed hilarious at a drunken BBQ at Brad's house, it's arguably no less out of place than many of the star and planet names, named after randoms and fanboys. Though still naive, it's also not close to on par with blind blunders like Empire of Magic(?) or Fallen empire/heroes, or whatever those tragic games were called (not quite carrying the torch for Master of Magic, and no A for effort).  So my review rating is FU/10.
It manages to be very different without doing anything gripping or engaging. Liking the prequel will not mean you enjoy the sequel. Possibly even a detriment to play the prequel.
Just one big grind. Not very fun.
The most annoying space game I have ever played. And I played quite some. What is annoying, is that you can only stay a few minutes in space before you need to dock again. Only dock. Nothing else. There is no interaction, no game play element. Dock, undock, done. People are arguing that it adds to a survival factor, but it really does not. It is an arbitrary money and time sink in a game, that is already grindy as hell. You need to buy devices that make you stay longer in space, however, they are far out in the outer sectors, where you can only survive a few seconds in space before your ship explodes. You can buy "potions" that extend that time, which makes it a money sink, diminishing your already thin profits.  The upside is, you can turn this off, but I think it is just an unnecessary element in this game. However, there are a few people that the dev mostly listens to and they want this kind of stuff, just so they can mod it out, so there is no chance in getting a game that is actually fun.   Mining barely makes any money and you can't get the more valuable ores, because of said survival issue. In star systems where you have rarer ores, there are also no refinieries and no way to build your own. This makes the game annoying. Why can't there be at least jet-can mining? Sometimes you have to do 3 jumps back to refine the little ore you where able to gather in the few seconds you have in space.  Combat is also slow and unresponsive. You can barely hit the enemy.  Then there is the waiting until skill training in the University completes.  The dev wants his offline version of Eve, but waiting times in a paid game on PC are just plain stupid.  What's next? Pay to reduce said time? I can already smell the mobile "features". This is basically Godus all over again, except the dev didn't abandon the game. Yet. I am just waiting for the instant skill learning ability to pop up as a DLC or premium consumable. To be fair, it probably won't, but that is how this feels.  The textures are also very low resolution, I don't get why the dev wouldn't add textures for higher resolutions. I can see artifacts on textures all over the place, especially the ships. This is unacceptable. That is why the bloom is so high, to hide the ships in the stations, so you don't see the low res textures. You have the option to turn bloom off, so you can keep your eye sight, but then you get blinded by the low res textures. Even Galaxy on Fire 2 on mobile looks better and that game is from 2009.  Summa summarum, it lacks in quality, as well as overall game-play, since there is absolutely nothing to do, except grind for grind sake, rinse and repeat. I'd rather play No Man's Sky and that says something.
I bought this game because of the positive reviews. As I sit here and read them I have come to the realization that I should have instead spent the $15 on whatever the positive reviewers are smoking.  There are people complimenting the graphics of this game.   Let me be clear there. This game looks worse graphically than X3 which came out in 2005.   Don't take my word for it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810/X3_Reunion/   But hey whatever - I don't mind ugly games - I sunk 20 hours into Beyond Sol and it's not exactly a pretty game - but it is fun.  This game though? I feel like I'm playing Octodad in a space ship where controls are meant to be clunky.  The UI is abysmal.  Hell the very start of the game throws you in a horrible station with intractable dialog boxes that are supposed to teach you how to build your char and what factions to join - none of it makes any sense and the writing is horrible.  Targeting things is a nightmare, looking around is tedious, controlling your ship is awkward. The tutorial and UI are nauseating and the interface is incredibly confusing. Mining is even more uninteresting than in EVE as finding the 'right' asteroid to mine is harder.  Oh and combat is horrible. This is basically a space mining game. Don't take my word for it again as clearly I'm less than thrilled with this game:  https://steamcommunity.com/app/954870/discussions/0/1679189548069639096/  So what you have here is a solo space mining game where you can mine to get a better mining ship to get a better mining ship? It's like an uglier Elite Dangerous!   Just buy Starpoint Gemni:  https://store.steampowered.com/app/419480/Starpoint_Gemini_Warlords/   RPG elements, doesn't look like dog puke, UI isn't an example of how not to do a UI and your ship doesn't feel like trying to pilot an off balance washing machine.
It's like single player EVE.  Great!  Your turrets aim off in random directions and won't align or shoot?!?  This is a dumb mechanic.  Throw it away or make it not suck.  Not great.  Life support is a dumb mechanic.  Not great  There's no sounds when you shoot, get shot, get locked, anything really other than music.  Not great.  Every time you dock, undock, warp, the game resets your view.  Ok, zoom out... again.  Press 4 buttons... again.  Not great. 
This game has alot of cool features, but I could not get over the god awful textures. Its like they wrapped all the objects in sci-fi wrapping paper. Also it crashed twice for me during the tutorial, so they have some work to do.
What a headache! Just go play EVE Online!
does not let you load realtime, once you die , it doesnt load to saved game, you lose all attachments not really happy will be asking for refund:((((
Interesting Eve Online knockoff.  All broken as heck.  As of the last patch my new characters cannot dock.  Can't recommend until they get this basic bug sorted out.
Well, the moment I saw in some comments that the game was like Eve online but for single player I got excited. The thing is, I can't recommend the game in its current state.   The game has a lot of potential but being blunt, it's closer to a student project than a final product. I will come back in the future to see how things are.  If you don't mind expend 12.5€ go ahead, I like the idea of supporting indie developers, but be aware that you are buying an Unity game with a long road ahead.
I cannot recommend the game in its current state and I think it is because of the UI/UX.  Something feels missing when trying to play/learn the game that makes it feel like you are battling barriers left, right, and center in order to have fun.  The only thing I can really attribute that to is the UI/UX.
This game is full of bugs and not ready for playing. the rats are imbalanced, and the weapon of the ship somewhat consume its charge in unreasonable rate.  the dev team should have test the game before release.
Controls are a complete disaster, committing the egregious sin of clicking something on the screen will cause your ship to immediately abandon doing what you were wanting to do and instead swerve towards the new object, while also beginning the targeting process (taking up a targeting slot for this new item you indicated you were oh-so-interested in and forcing you to manually clear the target to recover).  If the dot in space you clicked also happened to be near another dot, guess what, you're now targeting TWO things unwanted!  The main view comes equipped with a narrow field of view, prompting you to desperately zoom out in an attempt to get some clue as to where you are in space and what's going on.  Whoops, now you're on the map screen instead.  Why would this be desirable? Who knows. One thing's for sure, now you REALLY can't see what's going on.  You'll be sucked into this failure-mode often, mind you, as even if you manage to carefully zoom out to the maximum allowed without triggering this UI-subversion, it won't last long as the game doesn't bother remembering what the player wants and will instead force its will on you the next time you transition to the main view.  "Well stop zooming out so much, nerd!" You unintelligently counter.  No, you'll be wanting to zoom out as much as possible, as swinging the camera to look around comes with a horrific amount of blurring.  Oddly enough, the blurring gets even worse in tactical mode.  "What's tactical mode?" You ask? Well, since objects in this game are lit based on not whether they're facing a light source, but rather on whether your camera is facing a light source!  Don't ask me why, some weird attempt at light adaptation in a game with no caves.  Short of it, the standard view is useless, as any distant ships or small asteroids that are technically known to the player are just a dark pixel on a background of dark pixels.  Enter tactical mode, causing every interesting object to light up on the screen, and adding dots for ships so they can be found and clicked on (but don't do that, you fool, unless you want to both target and start flying towards said unknown dot.  What if you want to know something about the dot on your screen, you ask?  Well, you could click on it, but don't do that, you fool...).  So far, so good, except for all the not good things.  Not to be content with a mode that crispens the viewing environment and allows for easy information gathering, someone decided objects in this mode should come with a mega-sized halo, bleeding color into the surrounding screen space.  Did you forget how I said this mode makes the blurring worse?  Don't forget that.  It makes the blurring when you move the camera around worse.  Yikes.  Everything in space is a mystery, waiting for you to go out and discover it.  Except once you do that, it's still a mystery, because the same space gates you finished targeting and perhaps even traveled through will happily remain mysteries on your screen the next time you come back, forcing you to click on each of the purple objects on screen to find out which one corresponds to which direction.  Except don't do that, you fool, because now you're both targeting it and abandoning what you were doing to head that way.  You're allowed to drive using some keyboard keys if you like, which is the first notable improvement on EvE's design (don't copy EvE's UI and controls, kids...).  Except I hope you don't like being in control of your gameplay experience, because as soon as you dare to not be holding right click while doing so, the game's going to put the camera where it wants instead.  "But I need to move the mouse around to be able to click things in this control scheme based on clicking!" You respond - and you're right.  But you can do all that clicking from the back seat, while someone else swings the camera around for you.  Good luck.
I recommend waiting for more polish.  I'm not going to refund this. I know what early access is, and I want to support the creator. I can see the potential in this game, and it's more or less what I'm looking for (PVE solo EVE), but right now it needs a lot more work.  In my short play time I ran into multiple bugs. The opening narrative text is rife with grammatical and spelling errors; it isn't game-breaking but it is a poor first impression. The character customization has an index cycling bug with the next and previous option buttons. Once on the station I tried remapping my keys (left handed), and found several mapping bugs in the clunky UI. After I managed to change it somewhat to my liking, I realized that the player ground movement controls are baked in (WASD), which is a show-stopper for me.  For the first 20 minutes of my experience, nearly every system and UI feature I encountered had issues. I wish the developer the best and hope they polish this up because I really want to play it. But for now I'll have to wait.
Sorry, don't recommend.  I was buzzed by all the positive early reviews and bought it. But don't be like me. The main game systems are in place and it feels like a polished game - my first 2 hours were fun and whimsical, but the missions are a crapshoot. I know it's early access, but wait until it stabilises, and wait until the missions have been tested properly.  I've only played a few hours, but wondering if I can/should invest any more time in it until it gets a bit more foundation.
Absolutely no idea what I am suppose to do in this game. I watched few videos (not devs) on YT and all people has same problem.  1. You are on some space station with hundrets of options from first minute of gameplay 2. You can not start new mission because you already have one 3. You do not know what mission you already have 4. You undock the station, just to fly arround little bit with no clue what to do 5. You check a timer... less than 2 hours, refund time  Maybe this game have a potential - i dont know. I even dont know what kins of game it is. Puzzle, novel, strategy, clicker??? No idea, you just have menu on some space station and no clear information what to do. I watched some videos on YT (not from devs) and it looks like other people have same problem. They stack on this station without clue what to do.
too short and the game looks like some moblle FPS games 
The graphics and overall quality are good, but still could be improved if compared with top games. My biggest issue while playing was no connection to the story and what was going on, was more like a casual game.  I requested for a refund and would probably not post any review or just post a positive one for the potential that the game has, but after reading a review about the developer admitting to stole assets, and searching in the internet to confirm, I cannot recommend this game.
The developer admitted that he stole assets from pirated sites. That's thousands of hours or more of hours people's hard work. Not cool...
I can appreciate a game being made by one person and I can appreciate a game that takes heavy inspiration from other titles. But what I don't appreciate is the sloppy feeling of the cobbled together assets and the dull gameplay loop.  I would only recommend "Bright Memory" if you've seen gameplay that intrigued you in the past and you wish to support future development despite the stolen asset issues. If not, I would wait until the game reaches a state of finality and has hopefully resolved most of its issues including; stolen assets and sound effects, poor UI design, unengaging gamplay hidden behind admittedly slick graphics and repetitive fight design along with an incredibly short length for the price.  EDIT: I purchased and played this game back in late-January of 2019 and requested a refund for my purchase.
tl;tr - the game isn't so much fun. Everything seems to be put together randomly with mixed quality.  + The graphics seem to be nice and polished at first, with fluent animations, - but are rather bad and uninspired in the second half of the game when you're indoors. No facial animations.  + I like that there's another game with abilities and you can unlock new ones,  - but they aren't as good as in Bioshock Infinite, Dishonored or Mass Effect.  + Fights are satisfying, but for how long? - Are there any real combos? You can throw enemies into the air, but it doesn't feel as rewarding as priming and detonating in ME3 or ME:A - There's nearly no cover, so the gameplay is pretty hectic. Hectic games usually have a higher FOV.  - In general the game feels like there were no own ideas. Some quicktime events and two puzzles à la Tomb Raider. - The enemy design is just all over the place: human clones without AI, wolves, manticores, flying demons from Doom and the other half is from Dark Souls. They're looking boring expect the manticore. + 2 of the several Dark Souls homages are neat actually. - There are rumors about stolen assets (see the negative comment from another user).  - The audio is in Japanese I guess and the texts are poorly translated into English.  - Story is on the same level as Dooms' story until now.  + New game+ - lame additional outfits  - This comment took me longer than playing the overpriced demo.
Poor story (Japanes voice small english subtaitels not interesting story), Short game (44 minutes), expensive (There will be like 4+ episodes 4*7$=28$+ for maybe 3 hours gameplay and story), not understandabels mechanics.  The only thinf that actually cool Graphics and that the game was created by 1 man.  nice game but ill not buy it again and i will get refund from steam.
I had big expections because of the very positive reviews. First of all I think the game play is nice, it is kinda mix of Tomb Raider and Doom. Controls are good and if you have ever played an ego-shooter before everything should be familiar. The setting is interessting, something like "time-space-travel"? I like it. However Graphics are not state-of-the-art but also not bad. For a Demo it is really okay. And that's the point... The current state of the game (early access) is just a 25 Minute Gameplay Demo. I read something like "it is a one man project". Well so I guess it took a while to put all of this together, and for this it is great... what I fear is that this is another "never ending development story" which will need several years to finish, if it does... I'm looking forward to more content.  If you interessted in 25 Minutes of decent shooter gameplay, and your are willing to spend 5,5€ go ahead. If not, watch the gameplay as video and wait for a later release.  So for now... I'm missing the option in Steam: "Do you recommend this game?: Maybe", since this is not possible, and I'm not that impressed... I wouldn't recommend the game at this stage. However this might change in the future!  Ah and one thing to the developer. Please add a FoV option, since the FoV is to small for my big screen and the high resolution... feels like 10 years ago (or on console lol).
I personally did NOT like this game.
It's alright, but it is very early in development, you can't even change key bindings yet. I'd hold off on it for now.
unfortunatly doesnt work with ultrawide monitors at all using the ultrawide resolution (3440x1440 in my case) makes half the screen missing using a 16:9 resolution stretches the the picture over the whole screen.
Impressive game for being made by a small team, but it does not appeal to me since there are way too many things going on at the same time. It's just a game of button mashing to dodge enemies from all angles, and then hope that you have some skill to stop time, throw them into the air and similar. Why are there even guns in this game? They feel useless.  Pros: * Cool concept. * Impressive graphics. * Audio is quite good and fits the situation.  Cons: * There are enemies _everywhere_. Your fingers will hurt from pressing crazy combinations of shift+WASD, Q, E, F, C, etc - _all the time_. * The FOV is quite strange. It feels like you see too little of the actual world. * Did I mention that there are enemies everywhere? Well, that in combination with the limited FOV means that a single enemy will be able to block your whole view - and that happens all the time. It's difficult to play when you can't see anything. * If you have to dodge enemies all the time, at least make it so that you can't fall down cliffs and such.  Not recommended for casual players. This is for people who love to play over and over again until they learn the perfect combinations to finish off their enemies and progress further.
rubbish!
I'm impressed that one guy put all this together. Looks beautiful and fast paced but didn't work for me. I'm more of a Dishonored/Far Cry type of player.
this game is great BUT REALLY SHORT  i enjoyed a bit playing this game but it has a big lack of features  fov slider key mapping (had to change to us keyboard settings to play and change weap) lack of skills - upgrades finished the game in 40min ( bought the game 4€ - even a 4€ game should offer more than that)  otherwise this game is butifull and has great combat mechanics, it is linear and focus on story *the two characters ... are well designed and the game offer some futurisitc elements like hud on weap.  if you want to buy the game just be awair that :   -it is unfinished   -it is Really short   -lack of feature   -in development 
I am not impressed with this "game" at all. All it offers is flashy gameplay. It's riddled with bugs and poor game design. Even though one person made this, it's no excuse not to iron out the numerous issues this has and also it's no exucse to downgrade the game after it has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from buyers. Why would one use stolen assets? To make a quick buck? Why did I say "game"? Because this takes half an hour to 40 min to complete, it's a demo, not a game. All in all there is nothing interesting to see here and I shall be requesting refund.
This is one of those games that makes me wish there was a "maybe" option for whether or not I would recommend.  There is a lot of potential here but in its current state I would not recommend buying it.  I don't really care if some dude made this game in his basement with pritstick and glue this game is just not something you should invest in at the time.  Gameplay is really samey and without all of the effects I'm almost certain I would have been less engaged than I was.  The skills are pretty helpful, so helpful in fact that I think they kind of disincentivize you from using your guns especially when you consider that there are 0 bullet drops and if you run out of bullets on a weapon you can no longer use it.  Enemies are not very smart and pretty much just run at you in a straight line unless there is something in the way including the two bosses.  Its a 4/10 at best right now not counting the waifu, 7/10 if you are.
This is a great tech demo to showcase what a single guy can do, but, even as an Early Access title, this doesn't qualify to have the name "Episode 1".  In terms of story, it is the first 5-10 minutes of an action film plot stretched over 45-60 minutes. Additionally, seeing how this is a game made in China it also features Chinese voice acting, which for English users we can only know what's going on by reading the subtitles. Unfortunately, the subtitles aren't always visible thanks to the light beams on your player's guns and light reflections on the floor. White subtitles with barely a shadow and a brightly coloured bloom background doesn't help readability, neither does talking (what could be important pieces of dialogue) during an intense fight, which in my case was one I could not take my eyes off for a single moment or else I would die (before I realised I had the following ability.)  The video clips in-game quickly suggest that there is only one way of playing this game, and that is not just hack-and-slash: flying hack-and-slash! The enemies are essentially bullet sponges until you start slashing at them with your sword. Eventually there will be too many enemies in the same fight as you and, unless there is enough room for you to run around avoiding enemy attacks to regen health, you will always die to them. That is why when playing the game, you should always buy the flying ability (although, I was under the impression that you will also stay airborne if you shot out of your gun, but that never happened so I was mostly reliant on slashing away.)  Still, yeah. Using up an entire bar of the swords' energy deals much more damage than an entire clip from the gun. This isn't even situational, this is always the case no matter who you are fighting against.  Also related to combat, the UI with the special abilities' cooldown timers sitting in the corners, I never get the chance to look at them mid-combat. They should be positioned next to the centre of the screen.  To the Developer, FYQD: I do hope you spend time designing the game and only fix critical bugs instead of doing all your bugfixing now. For example, the combat could use a lot of balancing. I will update my review if things change (and I'm there to play it).
Interesting game but I feel the movility and the way the enemies move is a bit extrange. For example when you use the blast attack with enemies a they are floating is extrange that some of them keep moving to you. The movement in battle dont fill very natural but If in a development state there are a lot of margin to improve the game.
Absolutely solid setup for a game. Graphics are absolutely beautiful, movement is smooth and flows with the combat, the combat is genuinely hard and fun, the combat revolves around boss battles and challenging enemy encounters. Boss battles are fun and challenging, but I would say they are just a tad too easy if you are looking for a Dark Souls-esque game, which I would like to imagine is the target demographic of this game. Just about the only other thing I can say is that the AI is somewhat dumb, but it is as good as it needs to be.  The reason I am leaving a negative review? I had a great time with the game, but I don't think anything can justify spending money on what a demo. If you are reading this, definitely put this game on your watch list but I would advise against buying this, that is unless you really want to support the developers. Keep working on this, and I will keep watch.
after seeing the reviews i thought i would like this but... - i cant find an fov slider and the guns shake the screen too much in my opinion - the enemies are bullet sponges and couples with inaccurate guns suck - too much un-needed visual stuff around the gun - just give me the xp c'mon - too slow movement for how many enemies they throw at you ( but i do like the movement) - WHY DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE CAMERA AWAY SO MUCH?!?!"?!?! however: -cool abilities -fun movement and combos
Stolen assets...don't waste your time here.

Feels like a mobile shoverware game with terrible level design. You reach spot - some waves of bulletsponge monsters spawn and then all is repeated few times with cutscenes. No correct ultrawide display support and can't remap the keyboard (I prefer Ctrl for crouch, not "C") Subtitles are barely readable and you have to read them because generic poor voice acting is not in English. Heroine swears but the expression in voice is lacking.  Weapons do not do much damage so you need to wait till your abilities get off the cooldowns to damage the enemy. Heroine gets knocked out like in every second cinematic cutscene. Level design is bad. Almost every time you face enemy on a small arena and have to shift+ASD away from it. In bronze ding room if you jump and look into windows - you will see that there not finished level mesh out there. I got a fatal error crash in this room while climbing up and had to replay the fight. (missing checkpoint?)  Dank dark souls joke.
It's a 45 minute demo.  There's something interesting here in the fast paced gameplay but all the presentation is pure cheese and the enemies are generic and uninteresting.  Also skeptical when I see "episodic" plans.  If you're excited to support indie developers then go for it.  Otherwise wait and see.   
I don't necessarily like being the contrarian in this situation but when you buy a game hoping it will fulfill an advertised premise, and then it just... doesn't, and there's not much else to fall back on, what else do you say? I can at least say I see why it's getting the praise it is, it does make the developer in charge of this project look impressive, the game looks nice, and the premise alone makes it worth holding on to some hope for it, I'm just not particularly impressed with the design of this game at this point and unless the dev pulls out some really clever changes in the future, I don't see it improving much from where it already is.  Bright Memory is an FPS where the protag gets some neat abilities, but unlike Bioshock where many of said abilities are made to interact with the environment, these abilities. are made to be able to string together a cool little combo, complete with a style meter and everything. It's a cool idea, I'm sure many people have dreamt about the idea of a FPS with Devil May Cry tier combos and other such cool things happening and it somehow not being a total mess. If there's one thing I can say about Bright Memory, it's far from a total mess, but unfortunately it's also far from being this cool system that will produce sick combo MADs for decades. Ok sure, it's far from being some DMC, Bayonetta, or God Hand, most games aren't so what's the problem? The problem is that a lot of conventionally good FPS design got the boot in this experiment, so once you've mastered what bit of a combo game there is here, there's not much to fall back on.  Let's start with what we're all here for, combos. The idea is simple, you use a bunch of different abilities, enemies get flung, shot, and sliced into pieces, game tells you about your Smokin Sick Style, everyone has a good time. That's the gist of it and to that end, the abilities in this game do serve that function correctly, they let a combo happen, but that's it really. Due to how keyboards are you can only realistically expect people to be able to access so many abilities (and with inputs like, press F three times and Q+E, we're definitely already running out of space) yet so many of these abilities are combo starters and combo extenders that the only other moves left are gun,sword(which is basically gun but better), and tether. So the basic combo looks like EMP(or some other floating ability)->tether->Sword->Gun, there can be remixes and extensions to this combo but when you have so little moves to work with and your position in relation to the enemy is barely something you have to think about when it comes to making sure the entirety of the combo connects (since all moves are projectiles and if you're in range for one floating ability, you're in range for them all) I can't see the combo game evolving from, Float->Shoot->Suspend Enemy->Shoot->Re-float->Shoot, you know when I say it like that it almost makes it sound like this game is one Infected Chopper away from being DMC2,but that would do the rest of the game a disservice.  Onto non-combo talk, there's a lot of enemies in this game that take the form of melee only skeletons. The visual telegraphs seemed fine for dodging them although I think they could use some better audio cues, especially considering there were many situations where they ended up behind me, but besides that these would be pretty well designed enemies in a game where the optimal strat to fight them isn't just backing up so they never hit you. It isn't all that wise to shoot them while backing up like this is some discount zombie game as they do block your shots, but they won't block if they are floating in the air which to do so is really only a matter of "Is one of my many abilities that floats enemies off cooldown?"The answer is yes, it's always yes. So these types of enemies are pretty much just combo fodder and nothing else which I guess is a typical "character action" thing to do (although they typically don't dedicate an entire boss to being combo fodder). Regardless there is one type of encounter where they do work. As long as they are paired with a with projectile flinging bats then you are given something which you have to avoid while keeping in mind the terrain and the position of any skeletons that might not take so kindly to you dashing into them. It does work but it is open to a lame ending where you take care of the bats and the skeletons are back to being a non threat, and you can probably figure out that this is the optimal strat to boot. In other words, these bones are gonna need some more "meat" on them if they're gonna actually work.  So we have good projectile flinging bats, skeletons that are... there, not bad but not really contributing much, I suppose it's only fitting that we have the classic bad, out of place, gun-toting soldiers to truly balance out the quality of the enemy design, it's like Half Life 1 all over again. Hitscan enemies need specific setups in order to make for interesting, fun encounters, with level design being the most important factor. To make a long story short and probably over simplified, you'd need more cover in this  game to make hitscan enemies work, but that'd get in the way of the movement that this game focuses on, so it makes the whole idea of these soldiers being here to begin with seem weird. The encounters they're in right now aren't too bad but they boil down to killing everyone before they kill you. For that reason I'd hate to see a version of this  game later down the line where this game is long enough to have an actual difficulty curve and these enemies show up the way they are right now. I can't see that being a fun time.  I suppose that's all the important stuff I can fit here. I'd love to be proven wrong because I did want to like this game, I'm just not sure where to find the fun in this game.
Since the game uses stolen assets, I have no choice but to give it a thumb down.
Dark souls fps ripoff. week 3 is just tedious af.
"A member from Bless Online development team[9] on Chinese video site Bilibili revealed Bright Memory had used pirated game asset upon release. The asset in question is ripped from released game Bless Online and Aliens: Colonial Marines, including weapons and most enemies in game[10][11].  Further discussions[12][13] revealed Zeng “FYQD” Xiancheng made false claims that Bright Memory was made all by himself. Other contributors including the composer were not listed in the credits. "
It's a good game, it just needs some more fixes. Especially the English language. The translation from Chinese to English is really innacurate. It almost looks like as if they used Google Translate or something.
Game looks interesting, from what I could tell of the slideshow I could get on my 1080TI. Certainly wish I could play it and the picture fit my screen so I could see everything that was happening.
I can appreciate that it was developed by one person. But the controls are clunky and isn't consistent. Sometimes I can knife attack. Sometimes I can't. I guess it depends on what you're looking for. It's a faced paced shoot em up that seems a bit unbalanced with clunky controls. I'm sure with some refinement it will be better.  Good that it supports many resolution options, but a FOV slider would be great. Ultrawide cuts off a lot of details top and bottom of screen.
Maybe it'll become good in time, but at the moment it's just a poor man's Bulletstorm. Thank fuck it's £5 lol.
Meeeeeeeeh
As was already stated, the game is beautiful. What I struggled with was the combat and controls. If you don't learn to time every single move, you are going to die... a lot! It can also be hard not to be overwhelmed by enemies. Typical bugs for a game that’s been out this early. I had issues with clipping into the last enemy and getting stuck. One enemy somehow got stuck in the ceiling and I was stuck in the cave longer. Pretty easy to find secrets, but I don't know what they mean yet. Over all, I guess pretty good.
I've never played a japanese action game like this so I have no idea if this is typical or an evolution or not but I wasn't really happy with Bright Memory. I've played a lot of western shooters and games like Dark Souls but this game doesn't really have anything on those games. The shooting mechanics are pretty bland and due to the high health of the enemies and the mediocre sound effects the guns feel pretty pathetic. The game gives you several abilities you can use to stun and leap about and some of that is fun to use but still especially pathetic on bosses. The game also tries to shoe-horn in some terrible platforming and puzzles which only serve to frustrate and take away from the better parts of the game, the combat. Lastly, the controls are kinda wonky, targetting abilities saying "invalid target" when I am definitely facing enemies, the extra jump is very poorly mapped out and feels weak, and the critical stun ability has a huge delay that feels out of a place in an otherwise fast paced game.
[b] TL;DR: Bright Memory is alright, would do well to give it a try but if you're looking for a full polished experience you won't get it. [/b]  Bright Memory seems to do a lot of things right, but also some wrong. It has a very cool premise that's executed a bit lackluster, although it has a lot of potential for the future.  In general, the game is pretty good. The abilities feel satisfying to use, guns not so much. Level design isn't much to write home about, but it serves it's purpose as corridors that go from arena to arena with the occasional puzzle thrown your way.  However my real problem lies with the games UI and combat:  The UI itself is cluttered and looks kinda janky. We have no idea what the orange circles in the middle of the screen are supposed to be, since they don't seem to serve any purpose and are never explained. Add on the various visual effects that shake and make the UI pulsate and you have a recipe for disaster.  Next, the combat feels incredibly samey, spamming the same couple of abilities (EMP/Time stop, then lightblade) and then dashing around shooting until they come off cooldown. This isn't helped by the fact that almost every enemy (except bossess and flying enemies) are vulnreable to the exact same things, and thus you just do the same thing over and over with the same enemies. The mobility mechanics such as the jump and the dash also feel very inconsistent on tops of this.  While the bosses are cool aesthetically, they consist very much of the same gameplay as regular mooks, and both of the ones currently present also throw a horde of regular enemies at you, which is a big no-no (especially at the second one, which has an incredibly small and restrictive arena with additional environmental hazards).  That, along with how little content it currently has sums up my problems with the game currently, but I'm excited to see what direction the developer is taking in the future.  Also as an additional note, expect a few janky translations here and there. Nothing too bad or noticeable, but if you look for them you can find them.
While the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is not. There so many bugs. Half the time when I press a button or click my mouse, nothing happens at all. The enemies are glitched too.  The price is okay considering the graphics, but if you're buying this for smooth gameplay then I'd suggest you spend the money elsewhere.
Ok, so you will see from my time playing the game that I cannot have tested the game itself.  So it's not a review  about playing the game, but a review about not beeing able to play it.  The reason is that there is no way to change the controls: I am physically not able to use my left hand for anything else than using a mouse. As you guessed it wasd (even with the azerty to qwerty fix) won't work.  So I usually use the numpad or at worse the arrow keys to play.  I know it will be added eventually and that's the reason I decided to take the risk and not refund.  So here is the bottom line.  If you can't for whatever reason play with a wasd or zqsd (if you have an azerty keyboard) don't buy it unless, like me, you want to support the author.  I wish it was written somewhere in the description,  that for now, the controls cannot be changed from wasd as it was written in game.  Maybe in the following section of the early access box: "How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?"  As I said, I will keep the game waiting for the full release to come with controls. And this review will be edited to a positive one if the page is changed to mention the lack of controls.  Thanks in advance 
I kinda regret getting this game from the reviews on steam. I thought wow, 96% overwhelmingly positive must be a no-brainer! Well, now I know steam reviews isn't metacritic. There are plenty of good reviews so I'll provide a negative review   It's way too short.   The game feels too generic. Yes the combat, mobility, action has been done well but there are other games that have done this. I wouldn't mind playing more of that except that with the incredible generic and clique settings and dialogues it gets really monotone.  In fact, even the gameplay was fun for the first 10 minutes then it falls off fast. The boss was just a mob with large HP and the strategy of defeating him gets reduced down to boredom.   Throughout the game there are no real dangers or challenges because you can just keep up your HP with each enemies killed and you have abilities that doesn't cost anything, have short unique cds that can be spammed. When there are no challenges or risks of failure, the gameplay degenerates into an experience akin to playing in a sandbox. Fun for kids, fun for a while, but gets old real fast for those who have played a lot of games.  However, mad respects to the creator because aside from areas that need minor polish like grammar, it looks and plays like titanfall 2 level of AAA game.
there are some underlying gameplay mechanics that could be interesting, however the atrocious ADD pacing/flashing lights syndrome distinct of korean "entertainment" kills any satisfaction or enjoyment.  Enemy spam, bullet sponges, inept level design amounts to copypasting every silly call of duty moment in a chain with no breaks.
Can't believe this game is 96% positive. Combat is holding down left click with endless ammo.  Cut scenes after every fight ruin flow to game.
No story,no nothing... Dark Souls with guns.... don't waste money.
What cringy weeaboo shit is this? Going for a refund! THis is just garbage on an ideological lvl. Those manlets dont know to write even something mildly interesting.
Load the UI for the First time *Turns Hud Off & Style Panel*  Load ingame for the first time THERE IS STILL A HUD The first dialoge I am lost. You're in this hallway where you come to a computer after defeating basic enemies. Once interacting with the computer, Ghost AI appear from no where, from where you just came and has a black hole type explosion.   You come to the first "mission" theses skeletons take multiple shotgun rounds and pistol round before dying. 3/4 of the A-R magazine is require to takedown the genaric enemies. QUICK TIME EVENTS. 2014 called, they want to be relevant, i guess?  Then a couple mini bosses spawn that have more health but way too easy to defeat. WAIT. DID I MENTION THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY SETTING?   I had to alt+f4 and request my money back before i felt like i was playing warframe. OH NO, THEY WON'T LET YOU REFUND. Developers know they did something wrong. I give credit to the developer but i could not find myself playing a new style game. And no refunds is just dipressing
bug
Don't trust the overwhelmingly positive rating at current time.  I get that It's originally in Chinese however It's pretty funny when they call a Dragon a Fly Snake, maybe they actually want to call it that intentionally but. https://i.imgur.com/FXLThSZ.jpg
I honestly have no idea why this has such a high rating on Steam, it's actually astounding. Is this game bad? No. But is it worth the price or rating it has in this current early access state? Hell no. It's like a poor man's combination of Shadow Warrior, Quantum Break and Bulletstorm. Or, picture Devil May Cry but Chinese and as an FPS. But the whole thing kinda sucks right now.  Here's a few reasons why: [list]     [*]FOV is way too high for this style of shooter.     [*]Player hitboxes are way too big, you get hit ALL THE TIME even when actively dodging.     [*]Hit scanning enemies. Just fuck right off.     [*]Can dodge left, right, left and right-backwards and backwards but not forward. Why?     [*]Iron Sights. Why?     [*]Weapons feel and sound like shit.     [*]Unreal Engine 4. Enough said.     [*]Damage sponge enemies are not fun. [/list]  There are abilities on constant cooldown like a sword, stopping time and launching enemies into the air and the game encourages air juggling, but it's just not implemented well right now.  Maybe in a year or so this might be worth playing, right now, it's easily one of the most boring and overrated things I've played on Steam and if it didn't have a big breasted Chinese waifu, I doubt anyone would be playing it.
Graphics are nice, pretty much tastes like a generic burger with a little extra toppings and seasoning. For $7 I'd rather have a burger.
$7 USD for a 1 hour episode. Probably 1/10 of a game completed. If you do the math, that is like a $70 USD game. The standard for triple AAA games is that it is $60. On top of that author is copying off Tomb Raider with SCI-Fi mechanics. He claims that he himself work on the game alone. There is no way that is possible. He has multiple voice actors voice for his games. He definitely has some unpaid Chinese people working for him.  Yes, the gameplay is great. Now the hype is done. Episode 2 would require tougher enemies and a more in-depth gameplay and bigger skill tree. Question is would you pay another 7 USD for Episode 2? Another 7 USD for Episode 3? How much longer is the game actually going to be?  Apart from that a few bugs...Bats dying and spawning exp in mid-air. Enemies caught in the wall. Freeze mechanics not going off as intended.
omg this is sooo buggy. its terriboe state! great potential. but right now its not worth it at all!
Really fun gameplay but $8 CAD for 29 mins of gameplay is pretty disappointing
I guess there's potential, but as of now it's buggy, clunky, and the enemies are so damn bulky that it feels like shooting them does nothing.  The game itself is an hour long and during that hour, I found myself just backpeddling from enemies, waiting for them to die or for my skills to recharge so I could use them, then go right back to backpeddling.  However, I soon found out about a skill that allows you to stay in the air by shooting.  Thankfully this nod to DMC also happens to be the most broken and easily exploitable thing in the game, so abusing it was pretty fun.  Other than that there's not much to say.  Bosses were just big walking pools of health you slowly scratch away at while flying around, the story is nonexistent and incoherent, and there are some really bad glitches from time to time, however I did not see anything gamebreaking and I never experienced a crash.  I'll keep an eye on this, however, since I do think there is a fair bit of potential, but it really needs some work.  Controller support may also be helpful.
A mash up of games that the developer liked. Notably Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and the Shadow Warrior reboot due to the movement options, gun feel and focus on combat. There's even a Devil May Cry-style ranking system and an unlockable ability that lets you float mid-air as long as you're shooting. For the environments and enemies it's really obvious they like the Souls franchise - there's even an unmissable reference to it near the end.   The plot isn't even worth mentioning since it's obviously unfinished and it starts so in media res that it plays out like a fever dream. Probably better that way since the main character's SOLDIER EXO-SUIT ARMOUR has such an absurd boob window that it's impossible to take seriously.  The combat is fun but it's in between a bunch of boring glitchy platforming gimmicks and a lame Uncharted-esque match-three puzzle and really at the end of the day it's so short - clocking in at 40 minutes - that you're better off playing the games it's trying to copy until it's finished.  Games like these make me wish Steam had a "mixed" button for recommending games. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't really like it either.
No control mapping. Hold jump to double jump instead of simply tapping jump again? Dumb.
WHY IS EVERYONE PRAISING THIS?!  Steam where the heck is my "meh" option instead of just "yes or no"?!  Gooosh... Okay sooooo... It's alright, but it's short.   It's Early Access and the developer, to loosely quote, anticipates about 2 more hours of gameplay and this was about 1 hour. I assume it was 30 minutes to play it once and 30 more minutes to play it again but this time finding all the achievements, which doesn't really count.  I could mention how the combat was really good or how the current price is okay if the game is ever finished, but RIGHT NOW the "game" is at the length of demo.  Just wait until it's out of Early Access. I might join the praise train myself when that happens.
I play a lot of first person shooters, and while this one shows potential by mixing the flavor of a character action game and FPS together, it doesn't quite work out. If you've played Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, you know what to expect: a story you're not going to pay attention to that exists to drag you through combat arenas where you'll fill enemies with bullets and dice them up with blades of light.  Oh, and there's a LOT of broken English in this game. Next time, hire a professional translator instead of Google Translate.  Right off the bat, the shooting in Bright Memory is bad. Guns don't have any real kinetic impact, lack audible "punch", and the arsenal itself is so generic (rifle, shotgun, pistol) that I was kind of underwhelmed, especially given how unique the powers are.  That's another thing: the powers themselves. You've got an air dash that feels nice, except you can't dash forward for whatever reason (even though Advanced Warfare, which the game's mobility is clearly aping, offered a forward dash option), the double jump only works if you hold the jump button while your feet are on the ground (so if you're airborne and decide to double jump, you can't), and sprinting itself feels off. I can't really describe that bit very well. There's just something to how the game handles sprinting in combat that makes it feel bad.  Other powers include things like an "EMP" (which it absolutely is not), which functions kind of like a radial version of the boot kick from Bulletstorm, knocking enemies in its cone of effect into the air and slowing them down for easy kills. That's really cool, but the windup on it is awkwardly long, leading to a frustrating period where you're unable to do anything but walk around while your character raises their hand to prop up the enemies in front of you. The light sword is a cool weapon that allows for juggling enemies (or even keeping yourself afloat if used midair), and is probably the best feeling ability in the entire game, if not for the fact that its upswing and downswing have really odd animations to represent them in-game, leading to a weird floaty feeling to what should be a devastating ground slam.  There's also a Bulletstorm-style tether that drags you to enemies, but it doesn't work quite so well. Often I found the visual feedback from the attack actually indicated I was taking damage immediately after impacting enemies with it, which is just plain silly. The game's lack of a clear UI for things like health and such is also confusing. There's a bunch of circles around my gun, but all they seem to be good for is obstructing subtitles, which are colored white. This means that subtitles contrast poorly with UI and viewmodel elements, making them hard to read. That's not a huge problem, however, considering the story is an afterthought and all the subtitles (translated from Chinese into broken English) are basically unintelligible.  "What is?fly snake it looks like it's flying towards teh beam." - A line written verbatim from this game. This is one of the more easily understsood lines of dialogue in Bright Memory.  There's also a lot of basic options that aren't available, such as an FOV slider and remappable keybinds. Some might say, "aren't you being harsh on a game that's released on Early Access? It was made by one person." I'll respond in kind: if they're going to ask me for money, then I'm not going to hold back on the criticism. Is the point of Early Access not to offer critique to help a product succeed?   Bright Memory has impressive post-processing effects, but janky animations, awkward controls, poor feedback in combat, a nonsense story with a literal nonsense script, and basically no explanation for anything happening ever (even in a bad story, I expect something to justify why I'm in a jungle crawling through ancient ruins filled with undead) leave a bad taste in my mouth. There's worse games on Steam that ask for $7, but there's better ones, too. I've played too many shooters to spend much more time with this one.
This game desperately needs gamepad support as there is a ton of abilities to manage which doesn't really work too well with mouse and keyboard.  I'd say if you're going to try this, bear in mind that you are getting a single level of the game.  Now for starters I want to talk about what doesn't work in this game: Upgrade system doesn't seem to work with full screen at the moment, maybe it doesn't work at all but I haven't checked. All I know is that I cannot click the upgrade option. There isn't support for button mapping at this time and unfortunately the dev has mapped sprint and dodge to the same button which is quite problematic, hopefully we will be able to change this later on.  Now as for bugs, i noticed that the tutorial for the blast move prevented me from using any of my abilties as it got stuck on the screen, once I progressed however the issue was fixed.  Another bug that occured was with the last boss of the level where he would get back up, my character was trapped inside his body and couldn't move.  Those are the main notable ones so far.  There are 3 weapons: Automatic Rifle, Shotgun and a Handgun. I never saw any need to use the handgun personally and didn't see any point. The Shotgun is great though as it has a fast fire rate and is satisfying to use, the automatic rifle is better from afar and is better at targeting weak points but I stuck with the shotgun for the most part since it really is the most satisfying of the 3 weapons.  I will say however that adding ADS is kind of a waste in a game like this. Considering the fast paced gameplay, a more accurate crosshair would be more preferable over the ADS option because ADS only serves to slow you down and in a game where you are fighting hordes of enemies, it feels like a waste. I think the RMB could be utilized better, perhaps a secondary fire would be a good idea or maybe the option to quick map an ability to make things easier like the sword so that I don't have to use the keyboard all the time would be nice.  The swordplay is pretty cool but so far it is kind of primitive which is kinda expected from an early access title. I think there's some great potential to be had with it though.  I just think that keyboard controls just do not fit a game like this at all. There's too much to manage and while I commend the game's flexibility, it is going to need a very tight control layout. While basic shooting isn't too difficult with the mouse controls, the abilities are very difficult to manage on a keyboard. If this was just a straightforward FPS this wouldn't be an issue but considering the fact that it's an Action/FPS hybrid, controller support is an absolute must.  Now considering the massive amount of options, the control layout is going to need to fit all of these actions in. Here's what I think based on an Xbox 360 controller. I think the face buttons of a controller would be the best choice to execute the abilities, obviously right trigger to shoot, left trigger to ADS, right bumper to dodge, left bumper to sprint, Left analogue to move, right analogue to aim, A to jump L3 to crouch, R3 to use the (Q+E) combo that was mentioned in the control options... even though I never used it myself.  Now do I reccommend this game? Do you want to support an indie dev? Or do you want a game to play. I'd say you should only purchase this if you want to support its development. The game itself feels very basic right now, there are a few projectile enemies and melee enemies to deal with and a few bosses too. So far the game appears to be all about backpedaling and shooting/slashing due to the abundance of melee enemies that DO NOT STAGGER WHEN SHOT/SLASHED. I think the addition of staggering with certain weapons like the shotgun would be a good idea to delay enemy movement... perhaps at a small cost of fire rate. Also, the game doesn't give any indication of headshots dealing more damage/giving bonuses. Quite frankly I'd rather the handgun be replaced with an explosive weapon like a grenade launcher as there are tonnes of enemies at times and it can be easier to use an aoe on them. While you have a close range aoe available, there is no long range aoe and a grenade launcher would be beneficial. The handgun... not so much. Why use a handgun when I have an automatic rifle and vice versa. Handguns are typically used as sidearms in FPS or they are used for stealth with a silencer. In a fast paces fps like this they don't seem to work too well.  This game was very overwhelming but as a demo, it's kind of expected to be. I think this game has some cool ideas and a lot of flexibility but ultimately this game is going to be a gamble. It all depends on the controls. I can live with ADS and the flashlight but if they are going to take up value space on a gamepad then they perhaps are the main thing hindering this game.  Here's hoping that it will end up being a solid game at release... if it releases. I don't really have much hope for this project to be honest, it feels way too ambitious and realistically speaking, a small team will not be sufficient for such a game if you ask me.  As such while I would like to reccommend this game out of principle, I think that ultimately this is a project that isn't going anywhere any time soon... maybe the developer will prove me wrong on that and I hope so but I think this game is just way too much work to deal with and ultimately it is likely going to be a flop.  Still, I do think that the fact that an indie developer can produce something of this quality is incredible.
Update 1/30/19: As of the other day mutiple reports came in saying the dev admited to useing stolen assets for the game. For that i will be changing my review to negitive but keep my original write up for the game posted still as i did have alot of fun. I do not support asset flipping or stealing other peoples work.    First off, I just want to say how great this game is. Obviously its not perfect, the entire game is made by one guy. I am not the first person who smashes Chinese games because as we all know 99%, they make mobile crap. This game is different I could tell they put a lot of effort into this and isn’t just some asset flip. It got its bugs and issues but holy crap I had a hell of a lot of fun and def will replay this game again. Looks like its just EP 1 and I’m sure it will get more later on. The core gameplay is where it shines. Once everything gets a bit more polished and a more stable framerate this game is going to be amazing. I wish him or her all the success. Buy this game and support it sure its short but for a price of a value meal from a fast food chain. You wont be dissapointed and will have a hell of alot of fun.
While I enjoyed Bright Memory for a short time, I ultimately will not recommend it right now.  It's currently very short, taking less than one hour to complete, and even in that short amount of time there is a lot of repetition.. The same 3-5 enemies, certain mini-boss like enemies being re-used as part of a later fight, etc.  There are a couple of puzzles, but they're nothing more than time-wasters to help break up the fights, and offer no real challenge of their own.. not even sure why it's in there.  The final boss would not be challenging in the slightest, if he didn't spawn gobs of minions, and even then it's pretty trivial.  The biggest chance you have of dying in this game is if you let yourself get surrounded by enemies, without any of your abilities cooled down to help you get out.  So keep moving around and you'll never die.  Visually it's pretty impressive, at least for an indie game.. there are some cool abilities that I wouldn't mind seeing worked into other games, but on its own it's fairly lackluster after you've been through it once.  Somehow despite all the action, I felt bored at what would be about the midway point, and only pressed on because I heard it wouldn't take long to complete.  I don't think I'd have very much fun playing the rest, despite the 'cool' factor of zipping around, blasting and slicing up enemies.  This could have been a free demo.  I guess the price isn't too bad, but if you're a hours-to-dollars sort of person then you're lookin at a 1h / 7$ ratio.  I don't solely judge a game on that parameter, but I do factor it in with other praises and criticisms like the ones I've mentioned above.  About 2 more hours worth of gameplay are planned to be added by the time Early Access is concluded on this title.. but as we all know, early access includes no guarantee of a finished product, so I am reviewing the product as-is.  Keys are currently not re-bindable either.  That's a bummer.  I'd expect that to be excluded from a free demo, but I expect key rebinding to be included when I'm paying, even if it's early access.  Bottom line, it's neat.. it looks pretty cool graphics-wise, runs pretty well on my system, and you feel kinda cool for a while after you get a handle on the controls.. but at the end of the day, would I feel good about revisiting this at another time to play the other 2 hours if they're ever done?  Probably not, unfortunately.
[h1]I want to love you..![/h1] But right now, I just can't. I put almost half an hour into this game, and while I feel bad because I don't believe I gave it much of a chance, I also understand that this game is a short experience. At first, the game drew me in. Great visuals, sound is top notch, UI is fantastic. This game screams triple A, and it's surprising that it was only worked on by one person. The gameplay style is similar to Doom 2016, Bulletstorm or Shadow Warrior. Rooms of enemies, kill them all, maybe solve a puzzle or fight a boss, so on so forth.  Sounds like it's all praise so far. Well, after clearing the first room of enemies, things started to quickly go downhill. This game is brutally difficult, at least at the start. There is a good number of enemies in one room at a time, and they're all pretty spongy when it comes to taking damage. You're given a lot of really cool abilities to use for fighting these enemies, and they both look and feel awesome to pull off. Until you realise that these attacks don't do a whole lot of damage. I mix up my attacks with a flurry of bullets, sword swings, and a downward thrust to deliver a finishing blow. Except, they stand back up after that. I'll have to do that one or two more times to actually kill a mob of enemies. No problem, I'll just do it again. Except your sword is on a pretty significant cooldown, meaning you will have to dodge and run away while shooting these enemies with your not-so-punchy rifle.   A lot of enemies in the game are capable of blocking, or dodging hits from your gunshots, meaning you will need to utilize your sword and flash (An ability launching enemies into the air, similar to the leash from Bulletstorm) a lot. But the game doesn't give you these tools often enough to be able to feel like the badass that it wants you to be. I pull off a sick combo with my sword and gun, the enemy stands up again. I need to use that sword some more, but I wont be able to for eight whole seconds. I end up having to run around the room like a moron because the gun isn't generally effective against enemies unless they're stunned in the air with a flash. I could try pulling off a flash to stun them, but the wind up for it takes a few seconds, meaning I take a bit of damage trying to use it. My best tactic was to try and run around the room, and dodge while my sword cooldown would end. That is until I got into fights with enemies who had guns. At that point, there's no running away without getting shot from all sides.  The best moments were when I was able to use my sword. When I could launch enemies in the air, jump up, and alternate between hacking away at them, and unloading clips into their head while floating in midair. That's when this game feels its best. But with an eight second cooldown? I found more often than not that I was running away, and getting killed repeatedly by the same mobs until I was lucky enough to get the entire group into a stun state.  The only additional issue I had with this game was performance. It seems like maybe I wasn't the only one with problems, but while my game would generally run at 60 frames, there was a lot of stuttering during the fights. My build I ran it on isn't the newest you can put together, but it can definitely handle a lot (i5-3570K, GTX 1060, 16 Gig DDR3).  All in all, it's impressive how much one person has created here. I wont deny that. However, when I play a game in the style of this one, I go in hoping to be a complete and utter badass. I only felt that way in this about 25 percent of the time. The other 75 percent was frustratingly waiting for my sword to finish its cooldown, shooting at enemies with large healthpools, dealing with choppy performance, and dying too often. I wish the best to the developer, but I wouldn't recommend the game in its current state.
it is lagging a lot, i have gpu of 1070ti  but still its lagging  i have tried lowring the graphic quality but still dont know whats the problem 
 This game turned out to be an asset flip which uses assets stolen from a failed Korean MMORPG  ___________ORIGINAL REVIEW____________-  At this price tag, this game is absolutely worth the price tag. Just buy it.  That being said, as a 3A-game developed by one guy using UE4, there is still a lot more to be desired. The voice acting is actually more than good (am native speaker), the gameplay on the other hand IMHO needs much more care to compete with real 3A games. The weapons are desperately unbalanced and I feel like I can beat the whole gaming by using E only (A skill referencing Castlevania ). My first boss battle was a DarkSouls clone, however the boss design in DS just doesn't fit a FPS like this very well and I feel like some minor tweaks needs to be done. And while I understand the whole in-game world design as well as the puzzles are probably the developer learning from TombRaider, those puzzles are a little bit mediocore, lacks proper guidance and overall not intriguing. The load screen IMHO needs a little bit of transition at the end so it doesn't feel like the game will crash at the very next second.  Overall I rate it 8/10
So... Alright, here's what I have to say about the game after playing it for about maybe thirty minutes: It's disorienting, extremely difficult to play right off the bat, and the game breaks itself on occassion. Now, granted, it fixes itself pretty quickly, but the game itself has some really off mechanics. For example, the earning of XP. I don't know who's idea it was to have the XP be collected by the player in the form of these little discs that you have to touch in order to earn anywhere between 6 - 20 XP. It's an interesting idea, but it's so impractical. There were instances where I killed an airborne enemy and the XP was out of reach.  And remember when I said this game was difficult right off the bat? I mean that it's DIFFICULT; I mean, we're talking almost Dark Souls hard. The enemies are nearly impossible to keep away from when they spawn around you in masses, and you can take damage from them even when you're not that close to them, making it extremelly frustrating when you're trying to stay away from the black and white screen. The first few levels shouldn't be this hard, especially for new players.  Let's also not forget that when you start the game, you have no idea what's going on; you're immediately thrust into the action without a clue as to what to do. The tutorial actually doesn't kick in until after you've killed a whole batch of enemies in the first "Origins" level. Also, who is this character that I'm playing as? Why should I care? Who's the enemy and their significance to the protagonist that you play as? These may be nitpicks, but they're accurate nitpicks.  I will admit that the game makes me laugh sometimes, especially with the Dark Souls reference that they injected in there. But are they necessary? No. I'd rather learn about the story and the characters and start the game easily and steadily work my way to a harder difficulty as the game progresses. But the game just doesn't offer that ease when you'd expect it, especially when you're just starting.   Despite all my criticisms now, however, I enjoyed the game while I was playing. But the game as it is now just isn't worth the $6.99 I payed for it, and I wouldn't recommend this as it is now. I'd give it about a week to a month before I'd actually recommend it to anyone else. But I wish the developer good luck in his development and hope for the best.
Is it impressive that one dude did this alone? Yes! Is it fun? Not really...  The game consists of going from one battle zone to the next, and beating several enemies and bosses.  The gun play is bland. The abilities are OK, but it gets repetitive quickly. The fights are quite hectic. Shooting at enemies is pretty useless. You basically need to alternate between your "F" ability (damage/time freeze) and "E" (blade).  Cutscenes need polish. No idea what the story is about. Subtitles are poorly translated and nothing makes sense. But I guess that doesn't really matter.  I don't understand the comparisons to Doom and other triple A titles. The combat feels nowhere near as satisfying. For 5-6 € it's comparatively cheap though.  I wish the developer all the best, but at this stage of the game, I rather spend my time playing something else.  Though I cannot recommend it, I am not refunding to support the developer.
Rubbish game, cant even finish the first big boss without dying twice and bullets are not enough. The second big boss is broken, you cant do anything about it and the space is too little. Also, in the first boss there are a lot of bugs, getting stuck in the wooden fence and cant move. 
Very simple, i expected something more, not just simple screamers... So disappointed.
Waste of money, i sat trough the test with a dissapointed face, the test took me inaccurate saying i was stressed when i was calm. Unless you get easily scared then don't buy this, it just get's boring.
boring asf
saw a couple of my favourite youtuber's do this so I decided to play it mayself before watching a video. was a mistake though. it definitely is not worth the money; not even the jump scares got me, and I'm usually a really easy to scare person. I really did expect more. it could be a fun way to pass your time, but 4€ for half an hour of not really freaky or spooky question (unless they actually hit fears the player has)? nah.
While I do think this game isn´t completely terrible (the ambience was good until the jumpscares came into play, the questionnaire was alright) it definitly wasn´t worth the money I spent on it. if it would´ve been maybe 1-2$ then things would've looked differently.  And just for the record I don't necessarily dislike it for the jumpscares, it's moreso due to the fact that it destroys its own ambience/mood with it.
As others have stated, this game is decent for what it is. However, it is too heavily reliant on jump scares to the point they are just annoying. The ambient music and sound is good and the game would be better if it focused more on that aspect. $4.99 is a bit too much for what it is, drop the price down a dollar or two and it would be on point. If the developers were to flesh out the hypothetical questioning so it's more involved and reacts to your answers (e.g. you answer a question and the game says such and such happens, what do you do next?) it would be better. A good game to have people who scare super easily play - watching their reactions would be more entertaining than playing it yourself.
Meh. Entertaining if you want to spook yours kids.
I mean, it's not expensive, but it's also about as scary as the goth kid at your local high school. Not particularly intimidating, but boy does it like to talk about things like it's trying to back you into a corner at Hot Topic. Maybe save your five dollars.
Eh, it was kinda spooky but I kinda expected more than just spooky sounds and jumpscares. I was excited but how quickly the game ended kinda let me down. I would have liked a bit more.
The game uses text speed for both suspense and gametime. It's an okay pacer, but after the first run, you're left feeling unsatisfied. There's very little "lore" or story to be had and there's a few jumpscares later on. For a horror game, especially in the current gaming environment, there's not much to be had.  Its writing is edgy, predictable, and bland. One notable "bug" (might be a misplaced feature) is that the timer continues when you use the menu in the second "test" of the game.  It's aesthetically in-line with its theme, but definitely not worth five dollars for 20 minutes of gameplay.
Joke of a game. You feel pretty tensed up at first because its building tension, in the most cliche way. Once it throws its first jump-scare at you, you've reached its peak. It just throws a few more at you and then its done.   Feels like this game was made for letsplayers so it could ride on its populatrity.  I'd reccomend watching some Youtuber and save yourself some cash.  Granted, i didn't play this w/ headphones on so alot of the 3D sounds stuff was lost on me.
For $4.99, I really can't recommend it.  If it were a buck, two bucks, sure.  I've seen and played better games that are free or less than this.  For what it was, it did do some things right; it's not complete garbage, like I see a lot of people saying.  Some of the ambient noises were effective, and if you are home alone, it is at least unnerving to constantly have your surroundings questioned.  But it's mostly too  heavy-handed.  The jumpscares got me a couple times only because I'm highly suscepitble to them, not because they actually frightened me.  I find jumpscares to be pretty cheap tactics, and they were absolutely cheap here.  A well-executed jumpscare need a lot more buildup in tension.  Popping up in the middle of the question or dialogue was simply hilarious after a while, and I kept finding myself chuckling.  I can see what the dev was going for here, and I do applaud them for attempting something different, at least.  This was far from meta, however, even though it continually tried to push the envelope.  Overall, though, I do feel like this was five bucks I could have spent on something else.   I wanted to try it for myself after seeing John Wolfe play it.  I'm pretty middle of the road on it, but can't recommend paying full price, even for curiosity's sake.  If you're even the slightest bit curious, just wait for a Steam sale.
Whole bunch of cliche and edgy questions followed by some jumpscares. Absolute snorefest.
Scary and cool i love it 10/10
A fun exercize, with uninteresting results. Some questions are smart, and I played it truthfully. But many questions suggest a narrative that just doesn't exist. You go from a list of questions to an actual narrator that has a beef with you, but nothing's ever explained or concluded.  Nothing felt threatening or scary. Jump scares, I'm used to that, it's just cheap. Banging on doors was uneffective. This is very much not worth the price of admission. It felt like the initial rampup to something that's not there.
Finished this shit faster than the Anglo-Zanzibar War.  My reflection this morning scared me more than this. 
I don't think it's scary. Rather a little disappointing. All those questions about lie, phrases about someone in my house at night, all that things looks like someone try to get in my head. Someone very naive))) Attempt don't deserve money.
Supercheap jumpscare at the end (which you can see in the image above), the beginning is kinda cool but at the end its more like a "wait for the jumpscare" thing, which is incredible disapointing,
The game is very meaningless... basically you answer 2 hand fulls of unnerving, kinda scary questions see 1 picture of a disgusting kaleidoscope snake spider thing then it builds up to a jump scare of a monster that shakes, then it says you completed the test with one more jumpscare just in case you werent scared by the first one then it closes the game if you reopen the game theres a new test and it asks you trivia and all the correct answers are wrong or not there except theres random jump scares after you finish a question then THE END THATS THE END OF THE GAME, this game had potential, i liked the idea of it, i liked the sound effects... but it was just boring
It's a great overpriced horror experience. The game can be finished under an hour. Sadly, it's a disappointment for that price. I can't recommend buying this right now. You should just wait for some steam sale. Right now: This game really isn't worth it.
Disappointing, not very interesting.
Although the concept is interesting, the game relies on jumpscares. The content is overall dissapointing as many of the questions do not provide adequate responses and the slow, choppy text speed is very annyoing to follow. This is not a game to analyze your fears, it is a game designned to force the player to have to focus on the choppy text only to be met by a few jump scares. I would only reccomend this to people who want to scare someone younger or someone who is easily frightened. Do not get this game if you are expecting anyhting more than a twenty minute internet personality quiz with a pop up here and there.
This review is provided to you by the lovely viewers of my stream. They have very high IQs, and most of you wouldn't be able to comprehend their intelect. Amen.  "10/10 I would masturbat3 to again"  "play that game with sans the underton"  "I wanna fuck the zombie guy that shows up, he is sexy as hell"  "I was expecting a package today. My Bad Dragon pleasure product did not come in but I can hear knocking on my door."  "I think this game was edgier than the 13 yr. who made this razor blade is."  "One of the weirdest most unappealing garbage fests I've ever seen. It's almost worse than the alcoholic super kid game thing. (Lesbian Stranger Things.)"  "Please fix that sentence I found it hard to word."  "this game had more aids than me and my uncle combined"  "I think the games screen was glitching, should check that out."  "I actually shat myself on the jumpscares, I was like a poop jetpack"  "I'm deaf and blind but even I could see that this game was utterly shit. I spent money to sit in a steamy bathroom with my Google provided, Google Cardboard VR and"  "The best part was when it fucking ended"  "comis sans from underhill would approve"  "Where did the stock photo of the spider come from?"  "the seizures you get from playing this makes it all the more scarier"  "10/10 would uninstall again"  "I was told to take these tests and was not provided with a grade I could use to acquire my dream job."  "this got me the big pp growth, I'm now 2inches :)"   "Instructions unclear.... got dick stuck in computer"  "Is there porn of this yet?"  "definitely jack-offable, more so than those hentai steam games"  "This was the saddest excuse for a game I think I have ever seen and I played Undertale."  "Stay away from this piece of garbage.... can I get a refund?????" - A man who didn't buy the game  "I'm not sure if this game is better than 76"  This concludes the review, once again brought to you by the brilliant minds who attend my streams. They understand the better things in life, of which the developer of this game could never hope to comprehend.
Well that sucked lol
Wish there was more too it.
Cheap audiotricks, pseudo-psychological questions that probably wont really affect the outcome of the game and finished off with cheap jumpscares.. sad i pain Money for this...
Short.  Cheap attempts to scare.  Don't waste your time.
For a horror game, this game is bad. It's well made, but sadly it relies way too much on cheap jumpscares than actual horror. It's also extremely short. I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless: 1 - You got it for free. 2 - You have money to waste.
Game relies on the cheap set-up-tense-ambience-then-hit-em-with-a-jumpscare gimick but it extends on 15 minutes. Waste of time.
The guy who made this probably thinks that he is hot shit. That's about it.
More, and more horror games are turning thier backs to jumpscares, and gore, and turning towards a better solution. Taking ideas that have nothing to do with horror, and making them scary. It happened with Doki Doki Literature Club, and now it has happened with The Watson-Scott Test. This game disguised as a personality test to help you understand your darkest fears. However, as you expected things go south VERY quickly. This game will scare you, and make you question whether or not you are safe in your own home. It very rarely relies on jumpscares. However, there ARE some throughout the game, but I will not tell you where, or when. The best part is that the tests are randomly generated, with diffrent questions, and scares for each playthrough, and a final test that will see how long you can hold in your fear before you snap.  PROS -Great Atmosphere -Good use of Sound, and Audio -Good Idea, with Great Execution  CONS -Too short to leave a lasting impression -Can get very tedious -Isn't enjoyable if you've seen spoilers, this game is best played somewhat blind  Final Score 6/10  This is the first review I've written on Steam, and I hope this was helpful towards deciding whether this game is right for you. If it was, give it a thumbs up.
I came in with an open mind and wanted to like it, but I don't feel it's much different from something you could find for free on the web, and didn't really end up being scary. Appreciate the idea though.
Honestly, despite all the negative reviews I tried to approach this game with an open mind but it feels like not even the biggest coward would feel scared while playing this. The jump-scares are far too predictable and the 'story' itself is just boring. Definitely not worth the price
The premise is good. It comes across as a brilliant idea for a creepy pasta style game, and I was initially hooked. I felt myself cringe heavily at one point, in the best sort of way, especially when asked about a picture that just...urgh...I don't want to look at it again.  Then it really fails to deliver on said promise, trying to amp things up and up but doesn't quite hit the mark with me, so it only served to amp up the setting without me being along for the ride.  Also, cheap jumpscares will always be cheap. 
It was doing well with the sense of dread and psychological horror, and then all of it was ruined with a jump scare. The best horror is making someone's body react on its own.   The slight sounds were really good, the unnerving questions gave a sense of unease.   But once there was the jump scare, all that left and all I felt was annoyed. Wasted money on this. :\
Like what everyone else said, it has a really good idea, but the execution is something that needs a lot of work.   What this game should have been was something that would be different for everyone, not a set of questions that eventually lead to "I'M IN YOUR HOUSE, OOOOOOH!" I think this would have justified investment into this game, because then you could go back and explore and see what the other options did. Get the audience more involved than 20 minutes of questions and pictures that are redundant and bland, and you could have yourself something. Sadly, this is not what happened.  Furthermore, this game didn't need jumpscares, which was the one thing that made me say "okay, this game isn't good." Since it's relying on my real life atmosphere to be the source of fear, it's a bummer when all of a sudden an ugly zombie thing pops up on your screen like an uninvited guest. Yes it did make me jump. However, that's the point of a JUMPscare, and it's used so much that it has become cheap at this point.  Overall score: 4/10. I loved the idea behind it, but the final product of "bluring the line between the screen and the real world" felt like every other indie horror game that tries to do something new but ends up just doing what everyone else does in the video game industry.  P.S: a 20 minute game like this does not need to be priced at $5. I have played other horror games for FREE that had much more content and better atmosphere than this game provided.
This game said I was "Foolish with money" and they were right. I cant believe I spent five dollars on this crap.
I'm not a big fan of this game. It had a nice premise, but definitely lacked in genuinely frightening elements. Mostly (if not completely) jumpscares. (Also the text was annoyingly slow to appear). I would not reccomend this game, mostly because I don't think the 20 minutes of somewhat repetitive content was worth $5 to me. However, I would like to disagree with the comments suggesting the description of this game was in any way misleading; the steam page is very upfront about what the game entails, showing both an image of the results page and explicitly stating the test takes 20 min to complete. Also, from what I've seen, there are "secrets" to be discovered by replaying the game, so if that's your thing, this game might have some potential.  Overall, it's just not really my cup of tea. But if it sounds like yours, I wouldn't discourage you from giving it a try.
I was drawn in by the prospect of psychological horror and a proper examination of my fears.  I was dissapointed by yet another jumpscare "horror" game.   Please don't make jumpscares a thing again, they're not scary, they're startling and there is a massive difference.
This game entirely failed to impress me in any way. This was Youtuber bait, pure and simple. I've played crappy flash games from the early 2000s that blow this out of the water. A waste of $5. 0/10.
There are cheaper games that have longer gameplay. 1/5
While I am a sucker for games with faux psychoanalysis, this game fell flat while also falling short. The flow of the game is formulaic. Build up of tension with atmosphere and ambience and then break that tension with a jumpscare. Rinse and repeat. That is the entire game. The entire experience clocks in at 30 minutes. As such, I cannot recommend it.
Jump scares, audio cues, slow typing. Been there, done that, got the scars.  Time to meta this tripe
I was interested in this game after watching one minute of a playthrough of it. The premise sounded very interesting. Basically a sort of psychological test that would be scary and at  the end produce some sort of test results. Unfortunatley it wound up to be not so great. If you are wanting to play this game and expect any sort of legitimate analysis at the end you should turn back now. Not that I do not recommend it to some degree, and think that it has a lot of potential, it just isn't there yet. they oversold the scope of this game by a lot. spoilers inbound  [spoiler] The game starts strong setting up a solid premise that you are now invovled in some sort of exceedingly frightening psychological test that very few people are able to take to completion. it quickly oversells this idea by claiming most test subjects experience full body paralysis and/or cardiac arrest during the test. This detracted from the fear in my opinion. it would be much for realistic and thus more fear inspiring if they had went with something like nightmares and paranoid delusions. the game then goes onto ask questions which are you make you suspect that someone or something may be in your home and is trying to kill you. at first this was alright but it jsut kept on, and on, and on. it was basically their only angle. There was even a question that asked if this was your IP address, and then listed an IP address. But it was the wrong IP. how much better would it be if they made it show your real IP? much better. it was basically just 20 minutes of odd questions and insinuations, the viewing of random images, random door knocking and banging sounds (presumably to make you think someone was in your house), and the occasional jump scare that were painfully obvious in their arrival. NOT SCARY. I finally got to the end and hoped that perhaps it had some sort of analysis for me. the only analysis it gave me was that the thing i was most affraid of was "clowns" that was the extent of the analysis. I can assure you the thing I am most affraid of isn't clowns. its a good concept but needs more work and needs to have more angles than the home invasion one. also the final analysis needs a lot more detail, like a full page of stats and figures and so forth. to do this real questions need to be asked. 	[/spoiler]
It was impossible to get immersed in the game with its use of achievements and cheap jump scares with bad graphics. I feel like if they wanted to achieve an immersive experience where the player felt like they were taking a weird personality test, they really went about it all wrong. Not to mention the writing, which fails wholly at being even a little creepy, and reads more like a child's writting. As a fake-out personality test, it fails at being scary. As a cheap indie horror game you find of Steam, it still fails at being scary. It wasn't worth the $5 investment and 25 minutes of gametime.
This game is ass  spoopy man scream loud  oh no im in ur house  ps ur next  oh btw i type very slowly it more spoopy that way  sanic420.exe
Not worth the price. Sounded spooky and intresting, but ended up being slow and boring. The idea is good, but needs lots of work. Needs more content. The scares were cheap.
Jumpscares? Check. Atmosphere? Kinda check. Depth of the game? Uncheck. Questioning why you (player) are doing this? Check. In all seriousness and even considering news page going like "Hey, look! We scared some Youtubers!" this "Test" does not deliver. If you are F-ing with me then F to a full extent (and devs probably wouldn't cause if anyone actually dies from this (as they "hint") then they are in serious legal trouble), If you are testing me then then test to a full extent (no joke answers, proper structure, crapton on questions). This "experience" only made me jump when it literally jumped at me (and that is no spoiler, we all see the "product" screenshots). Other than that - it failed. IMO what they could've went is - you answer "calibration" questions so game understands your room layout, whether or not anybody is inside your home (not house!) already and what is construction of your room (furniture that sort of stuff) OR the location where you would prefer "testing" to be undergoing (sex dungeon, I had to go with this). And then... do a proper testing with... that person. An actual testing, of course. Or "shortened" testing with branching (and after I've done mine I checked what questions were Youtubers getting and there's clearly no "intellectual" algorithm to this). Then maybe I would actually consider forking 5 damn bucks for this experience. Unless they improve the experience (I can't justify the "game" tag for it) this is a hard pass-by for most folks.   Unless you are alone in country-side house with maybe 2 stories to it and you don't live in there very often so you dont know what sounds your house actually makes.
If this game were free I would recommend giving it a shot just for the heck of it. But for $5 dollars? Absolutely not. You want the plot? Have it: This game is a test. Answer questions. Background image gets more visible. "Scary ASMR". Meta questions. Glitchy Text. Test Complete. *cue jumpscare* Get test results. It's not worth $5 even with the "bonus test" that bored me to death wasn't even worth my time.
As interesting as the concept is, the game really doesn't deliver on the psyche-digging that would be needed to truly break down a participant's fears like it claims. You would need branching questions based on the answers and dialogue trees at the very least, giving everyone their special kind of hell, but this game doesn't even have that. It's just underwhelming threats that someone's in your house, then a test of your knowledge on spooky stuff, and that's basically it, no matter what answers you choose. I'd love to see someone else try this concept, but as for this game, it's utterly dissapointing.
Was hoping it'd use my fears against me. It didn't. Was hoping I could speed the text up. I couldn't.
* Predictable and Weak *   So I saw it for $5, it's Halloween, what the heck right?  Sadly it's just another horror game with the occasional jump scare -- at least for me.  And the slow text is just irritating.  It attempts to pull some psycholocial scares but the clumsy, heavy-handed nature of the approach ruins the effect.  Probably approaching from a less bloody obvious way (pardon the pun).  It might effect other people but it didn't do anything for me.  While it claims to randomly generate the test, the general style of everything stays about the same.  You won't have your deepest fears exploited, it will be the same attempt at one regardless of responses, at least with my few playthroughs and a peek at some other people's after I did mine.  And I guess that's what's most disappointing.  Without really adjusting to the answers, the game really feels like doing a marketing survey with spooky noises in the background.  I mean...  could I get some ghosts if I request some ghosts?    In comparison, Paranormal -- a one person show -- was much more tense because of the random supernatural occurances.  It says ghosts, I got ghosts.  At the very least I didn't have to wait for very slow text to appear.
I really wish there was more to this game, but it's just not worth the price with the amount of content it has.
Wowie. This didn't even spoop me at all. To be honest, the options weren't always that great and the jumpscares were cheap. The 'tense' atmosphere it tries to create is ridiculous and I found myself laughing at the absurdity. I think it should have been orientated differently but with the same idea in mind, maybe leaning more towards something psycological rather than... Cheap. The actual content you get isn't worth the price of the game, don't buy it.  (I realised how short the original review was so here's an extension)  When you're attempting to create options for a game, you can't put words into a players mouth. Forcing options upon a player isn't being creepy, isn't giving the illusion of the player not being in control... We can close the game for gods sake. It's not like we're trapped. It breaks the immersion as you shut off any personalisation players have attributed to the game. POINT NUMBER TWO. The atmosphere. Phase one cannot apply to all players. Remove it out right. If you're going to make a game based on personalisation, make it so it can apply to a wide audience. It's not that hard of a concept. Phase two... Guh. It's not creepy to have screaming in the background, that's just edgy. I suggest the sound design takes a big step back from dramatics and tries a more subtle approach? Make it so you think you heard something but you're not sure because of that unsettling and quiet ambience... Not HELLO, I AM A BIG FAN OF SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG.   Overall, the concept and the actual gameplay doesn't allign but is contrasted. The untapped potential of this psycological horror is an absolute shame. This game would need some dramatic changes to scrap together something good from this mess. Please and thank you.
This game has a really cool premise and I was excited to play it. The psychological horror subgenre works by getting under the audience's skin, and what better way to do that than having them straight-up tell you what scares them?  Except that's not what this game does at all. The approach it takes instead could be summed up more accurately as "OOH I'M INSIDE YOUR HOUSE! SPOOKY!! I DON'T LIKE YOU. ARE YOU SCARED OF ME YET?". It's cheap and juvenile, and it ruins the suspension of disbelief because I [i]know[/i] the game can't get inside my house and kill me. When your premise, a personality test, is implicitly grounded in reality, you can't present a completely unrealistic threat and expect it to work. There's a lot of other silly stuff too, like repetitive stock audio of a man screaming, and some really cheesy writing that reminds me of stuff I made in early high school. Even at its best, the writing was just.. not spectacular. It felt like it could have come from any number of dime-a-dozen horror games that try to address the audience.  The only part of the game that really affected me were the jumpscares, which I hate on principle because they're more startling than scary and take almost no real skill to execute. They weren't even done that well, either - I saw the first one coming from a mile away, and the ones after that came in such quick succesion that I became numb to them entirely.  There is one good thing I can say about the game, and it's that (outside of the silly cgi jumpscare man), the visual presentation really makes the most of what I'm assuming was a very low budget. The parts with the fullscreen images were actually pretty cool, and even though the text glitching effect wasn't really necessary, it did at least look really good.
well i honestly thought it was pretty decent, UP until the point where we werent able to answere questions as honestly as possible because there are literally questions with all choices being the same answere for, shock or creep factor i guess but it totaly kills the immersion meant to make me FEEL involved.. this could have been two thumbs up.. instead.. im giving it two middle fingers down.. this turned out to be straight up trash. skip this shit homie.. only get this if youre trying to scare your easily scared gf or bf or baby brother and sister.. it was worth the 5 bucks for that i suppose but considering ive no younger siblings and my girlfriend is tough as nails.. im refunding this and getting a pack of gum first thing in the morning..
Eh, it was an okay game... basically the game asks you a bunch of 'creepy' questions and hits you with a couple jump scares. That sounds about right for 5 bucks. Personally I was entertained but not impressed nor scared. Maybe this game is better suited for children who frighten easily, but for adults this game is as scary as doing your taxes. Check out my Twitch channel for my let's play! https://www.twitch.tv/videos/329473559
This game only lasted roughly half an hour and then it was complete. It was enjoyable, but definitely not worth $5
no
Any game that has to resort to jumpscares to scare a player is shooting itself in the foot especially if the atmosphere it had before the abuse of jumpscares was actually pretty respectable.
It's a shit game that relies on basic jump scares that would've only been mildly disappointing were it free to play instead of $5
Interesting concept, but not much to the game itself. I would love to see more however. One gripe I do have is the actual "scary" part of the game. The concept of "spooky" computer glitches, a generally eerie ambiance through noise has been done hundreds of times, and has been executed better before. Pairing this with cheap jumpscares and blatant in-your-face "scariness" makes for something that feels more like a game that YouTubers will clickbait quite hard, and less of a true "horror" experience, whatever that may be.
To answer your questions: No, nothing interesting ever happens. Yes, there is a House of the Dead-level jump scare. Yes, I am very susceptible to jump scares. No, it did not make me jump.
Odd noises and jumpscares. It would be more fun if this was an actual test.
I hope you like jump scares spoopy noises because that's all this "game" is. Save yourself some money and watch your favorite youtube widly overreact to it, that's what this was made for.
This game is not bad , but i expected more from it. It isnt scary (some jumpscares).But my biggest issue with this game is that is short and that the analysis was half right. (sorry for bad english)
Sound effects weren't great, relied on a jump scare, and wasn't very convincing. I really tried to buy into it, but the premise just didn't do anything for me.
https://youtu.be/CNI7OSDJKQ8  Similar to Simulacra, the Watson-Scott Test has you aking if you are playing the game, or if the game is playing you. With a horror them that wraps into a steady narrative that tries its hardest to terrify you with plety of jump scares, random noises, and heavy breathing. Creepy, yes. However, the first of the two tests I took part of is the only one that really felt remotely fleshed out. The second was a bit weak overall.  If you know someone easily frightened by loud noise, this may not be too effective, but for a cheap Halloween gag it may do the trick. Other than the heartiest of laughs from me ever caught live on a twitch stream, and a few randomc chuckles from a sudden increase to bizarre levels, this left me bored overall. I can't really recomend this game at the time, as even some children will immediately see the game's hand being played well in advance.
I feel like this game is more of a "Test" in the sense that the developers were mostly messing around and it just happened to end up on Steam.  Pros: [list]     [*]Shifting images in the background added to the atmosphere.     [*]Use of stereo audio, such as the knocking, likewise added to the game.     [*]It's cheap. [/list]  Cons: [list]     [*]The pros that I listed were used sparingly, to say the least. The systems that are in place have potential, but they're underutilized.      [*]Use of jumpscares that are cheaper than the game itself, completely unrelated to your answers and with no real buildup. Very out of place and tacky. [*]Doesn't feel like the game actually took my prior choices into account as it progressed. I was expecting some kind of scare related to my input, but I encountered no such thing. [/list]   TL;DR It's not very good. It could be good if it was improved upon, but as it stands I wouldn't spend money on it. There are better psychological horror games out there for free.
jumpscare/10
Going into it i was excited and happy. I thought maybe now i'll get a horror game that actually scares me, but no. A few little "i'm in your house scares" and a few jumpscares (as per usual). So almost nothing new. The images didn't make me feel anything, there weren't enough options as answers: at times when something was forcing me to pick a scared option, i really wasn't impressed, i was in laughter. Not scarry, but i'll keep it to give someone else to play it, so they don't have to waste their hard earned money on this little "scary" experiment.
take a " test " with no real bearing or weight, with answers that you are pigeon-holed into choosing ( I said I don't belive in ghosts, and then he asks if I saw a ghost. Excuse me, I just said I don't believe in them, why would I then tell you i SAW ONE? sheesh )  the text scrolls at an INSSUFFERABLY SLOW RATE. so slow I thought the game kept freezing, in the middle of typing out a single word, it stopped twice. TWICE. I'd be fine with it, if I weren't rolling my dang eyes at how silly the first test quesitons are in the first place. I'm maybe not the target audience for this. I'm a little over 12 years old. I mean, I'm 34. So this isn't spooky to me, GHOSTS! SHOCK ! TERROR! SPOOP! i mean c'mon :/  I won't spoil anyhting for ppl that might be into this, but all I felt liek was I was wasting my time. It was never clever. There is a single solitary moment where maybe the game had somehting neat, and then i just pisses it away in my eyes.   so to sum it up : this is a rather boring and by the numbers spooky thingy. I am never bothered in the slightest by " horror"  games, but this is neither horror, nor a game. take from it what you will. 
i sleep 
Interesting concept, poor execution. It's supposed to be a pyschological-horror, but it ruins this by pigeon-holing you into certain responses and makes broad generalizations about what your deepest fears and anxieties are. To add to this, there are cheap CGI jumpscares. It would be better if they tried to be more atmosheric. The text moves unnecessarily slow and I found myself more frustrated with the pacing of the game than unnerved. It felt like the game didn't really understand what it was trying to accomplish but thought it did. A $5 price tag on something this basic and simplistic is outrageous. I expected much more. There are plenty of browser "quizzes" or similar ideas that can do what this accomplishes for free. Two developers and this is what they accomplish in a "short" period of time. To add to this, the addition of statistics without any actual data further adds to the immersion-breaking of this poor excuse of a game. I hope the developers can improve this game, otherwise, don't buy this. A waste of money.
It has really boring CGI jumpscares, and the second test didn't give me any results.
i want to die
This game starts off great! It's got a very Simulacra/Sara is Missing vibe that's got you feeling paranoid and uneasy. The questionaire is designed to make you feel like you're crawling out of your skin. There's some subtle effects that really add to the spoops.   Sadly, I'm a big fan of sound design and this game does not understand subtle audio. Things designed to make you feel uneasy are used too much and just become expected and obnoxious. Some of it was done well, but most of it was just bleh. I don't want to get too specific in the event you purchase this one for yourself.   No spoilers, the ending was very expected and you feel like your entire time was building up for that one payoff and the game doesn't even execute that correctly. Lots of potential that's unfortunately wasted by getting a little heavy handed in cliche scare tactics.
I thought this game was something more than just scares, perhaps actually have an element of "personality test" in it. Instead there were some cheap jump scares and sily questions in which it didn't rally mattered what you answered, probably matter only for achievements. Don't buy it, it's not worth it at all.
"Do you believe in ghosts?"  No.  "Have you ever seen a ghost?"  Obviously not..
Was expecting something great, but was rather disappointed. I like getting scared so I put on my headset and turned off all lights. Only gave me goosebumps twice, didn't cause me to jump. Told me my deepest fear is being stuck in an elevator, wrong. Literally nothing scary about that. Really weak jab at trying to be deeply psychological, weak, weak attempts at inducing paranoia. A few questions made me feel like I was talking to a cop, trying to make me choose an answer that would contradict a previous answer. Annoying with cops, annoying in games.  Sound effects- 6/10, sounded great but sometimes the coming sounds were way too obvious based off what the game was saying. (Asks if you think you're safe, while home alone, *cue obvious creaking door, foot step sounds, etc)  Jump scares- 2/10, Same thing like four times.  Actual questions -2/10, Far too many times it lacked having a single, remotely-close option, multiple questions with five options, while you only really have two because they thought it was somehow clever to make four options the word "Yes".  Oh yeah, and fuck off with the hidden achievements. Why the fuck would I play the same test multiple times if I have to lie, to game the outcome; in order to unlock achievements.  Could be good with a couple revisions.  Definitely will not bother opening it again and push refund in ten days if there are no updates.
This should be a $1 game if that. It's a neat meta concept with poor execution and relatively no gameplay. The Jumpscares are a cheap replacement for genuine tenseness and well-crafted horror. If they manage to add a plethora of content in the next few months that actually create a psychologically-horrifying atmosphere i'll come back and give it another chance, but until that happens this game is not worth your time or 5 bucks.
It was predictable, it had jumpscares, the speed of the text scroll is not adjustable and it didn't matter if i finished the second test before timer would run out. In fact, it seems that it is meaningless sans for one achievement. On the other hand, it is cheap. I guess if you have nothing to do and half a hour to spare...
This gave me an actual fucking seizure pls refund me thx
It questions and little glitches were pretty fun, but really really basic jumpscares. They were kinda predictable BUT The sounds were on point, love it for a creepy atmosphere, but would have been better if it spooked your mind and didn't scream or have a little boi pop up and scream at me. Silly kiddo, must have forgot this is [strike] Not	[/strike] a game
I could smell the jump scares coming a mile away. Jump scares are cheap and lazy. In any case, I can't be too harsh on it because I've spent far more money on far worse things (games and otherwise).  My comically long gameplay time is because I left the game running while I went off to work. I do that a lot.
I expected something interesting from this game, but all I got was pretentious horror tropes and writing with nothing but shitty jumpscares to reward your participation. I didn't bother going farther than the initial test because nothing much changed from the first question of the bonus test. If you're looking for psychological horror, you could do much better than this.
The hell is this
All the reviews already writter are true. Bad and poor game, no explanation.
Extremely limited at launch, barely any technical tools to use, the charts are extremely basic without even an option to adjust between time periods. The quantitative strategy beta is probably the best thing, is bery easy to use, but currently the API is extremely limited. It has potential but as of now its not worht the money.
Very disappointing! I hoped this would be cool, but it isn't!  Here some reasons: ---------------------  - No Stop Loss Limit  - No Take Profit  - Not even one chart analysis tool (No Bollinger Bands, No RSI, nothing... niente...)  Sadly every free Forex demo account offers tons of feature, but this program doesn't even have candle stick :-(  If you open a couple of trades, for example you doesn't even have an overall view of all OPEN TRADES. Every, really EVERY simple trading account offers this kind of feature.  In this "game" you have to select the currency again and than you can see the open or executed trades.  WTF... Very "helpful" if you have 10 or more open trades.^^  I need an overall view of ALL open trades to see on first view what's going on and don't want to search the currency from a list to see my trades or close an order...  I would really like to know if the developer used a real Forex account at least once in his life! (Guess no!)  - You can't see any kind of percentage changes of your open trades... (lol really???) Also the sum doesn't change.  If you execute a few orders and try to take a look into your order history, there is NOTHING...  The money you can invest doesn't change (even on realtime tab) doesn't matter if you win or lose money.  What's the rate of refreshing 1 hour or even more?!  You can change the language and 90% is still in english the rest is really bad translated.  Honestly if you want to play around with this you need another Forex account to make decisions.  So the question is, what's the point to use this?  I'm really frustrated with this kind of software. The idea is great and it's made sooo bad!  People should learn trading Forex with this? Really! You must be kidding!  No and I don't want my money back, this is cheap as hell. Maybe it's like this, you get what you pay for... (Also forgot to say, it had common Unreal Engine bug.) Had to add -dx12 behind the shortcut, otherwise it would directly crash after start...)
This is a joke. Better trade with real brokers on demo account. Seems like developers didn't even talk with someone who trade forex. Shame. I thought it will be an interesting game. Chart is useless you cannot even zoom in and out. There is not a single tool for analysis, no drawing tools so you can't draw a simple trend line, no indicators... nothing. There is only one chart style and it is a line chart, there is no candlesticks.... If they even talk with someone who have basic knowledge of trading they would do a better game than this. Have feeling like i was scamed. Will ask for refund.
Out of all of 100% OJ's character pack DLCs, I'd say that this one's probably the most underwhelming at this time.   I’ll explain why I think that by explaining how the two characters included usually are in game:   [h1]Mei:[/h1] Not a very good character compared to others and should pretty much just be considered a weaker QP with her 4 HP and 0/0/0, REC 5 stats with a worse hyper. Yes, Red and Blue gets around this and adds +1 to all of your battle stats, but depending on the card you start with (if the card is higher than Level 1), it will be nearly impossible to even obtain Red and Blue for the entire match, unless you happened to pack Bad Pudding, Flamethrower or Scrambled Eve to get around this in the middle of the match.  [h1]Mei's Hyper:[/h1] Her hyper, White Christsmasher, has some potential, but only in its stronger version, True White Christsmasher, which you can't obtain without having Red and Blue, and will deal 4 damage to any players within one panel of you, and if they’re KO’d, will give you their Level times 10 stars, and 2 wins, at the cost of 20 stars. The hyper is a bit too situational to see any beneficial use.   [h1]Other Thoughts on Mei:[/h1] I still wouldn’t consider Mei to be among the worst characters in the game, but she comes very close to that.   [h1]Natsumi:[/h1] In my opinion, Natsumi is one of, if not the worst character in the game right now, and just like Mei, is essentially a weaker QP but with 5 HP and -1/0/0, REC 5 stats, with again, a worse hyper. Her concept of healing the other players and gaining stars from it honestly does sound like a pretty good character on paper. In execution, that concept ended up being terrible. Even if you get stars from healing anyone standing on the same panel as you after your turn, it's hardly any stars at all (5 stars for each other player healed as of the Crossed Christmases update, better than how it was previously), and with her -1 ATK stat in mind, there's almost no reason not to bully her for the stars she carries. And she can't bully you back and chase you down like almost every other character can, because she heals that tiny amount of damage she does to you right back up. This is especially true when Natsumi's going against a character such as Flying Castle, a character that before this pack released, I considered to be the worst character in the game due to their crippling passive of not being able to counterattack. When Natsumi attacks Castle, that crippling passive becomes irrelevant due to the damage Castle takes from Natsumi being healed back up, and not taking any damage from her at all in the end unless she, in the rare event, deals more than 1 damage to them.  [h1]Natsumi's Hyper:[/h1] Her hyper, Cooking Time, is situational, however you'll usually earn more stars than you spent to use the hyper, earning 5 stars per HP recovered, and each player recovers your Level’s worth of HP, and the hyper costs your Level times 5 stars. The hyper however, doesn’t make up for Natsumi’s numerous shortcomings previously mentioned.   [h1]Other Thoughts on Natsumi:[/h1] Unrelated to how the character performs, but her two idle voicelines are said very frequently, and are very annoying (frequency of the random lines has been decreased as of the Crossed Christmases update), though this can still be dealt with by turning off her voice.   [h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1] Overall, I wouldn’t recommend buying this pack at all, or at least save it as your last priority if you plan on buying all of the character pack DLCs. The characters aren’t good, both of their voices are annoying, and have hardly anything to make up for their shortcomings. The Red and Blue pet isn’t worth it either.    Thank you for your time if you actually stuck around to read all of this.
Sorry those idles voices lines are kind of annoying . . and i dont want to turn it off !
This "game" is just a demo, it ends around 20 minutes in game with a screen showing "Thank you for playing demo".
I played for around 10 minutes then it said thanks for playing demo v2 and quits.  I thought this was a full game.
The screen is not optimized for Mac OS X no matter what resolution you choose.  Part of the bottom of the screen is off screen so you cannot get the map to scroll down once you scroll up.    ALSO, the game is Air & Sea units ONLY. No land creeps to worry about. It is VERY hard to place towers!!! You can only place towers on flat land which is random, so some maps you'll just quit and try a different map. It is so frustrating watching creeps pass by as you are frantically trying to find a spot you can place a tower on!!! Very frustrating! Terrible design choice and a waste of time and money IMO.
Played this for a very short itme, but instantly realised there are better free games. For some reason the maps I had were very limited as to where I could put any towers (the exact opposite is true for other tower games I have played).  I really could not recommend the game due to having played free games that are substancially better (and more developed in respect of game modes available... 1vs 1 , 2 vs 2 ,3 vs 3 , 4 vs 4, co-op mode etc.etc.)  
nice game من صج أنك قواد
Bad. Bad game. First of all. Timer - it's not ok. We are playing puzzle game. We want to relax and don't have race against time. Second. Background is fail. It's hard to see puzzle pieces and work with them. Third. YOU SHOULD'T have complete picture in your workfield. In my opinion this thing simply destroys magic feeling when you collect puzzle. 
A few things to note: - When picking up overlapping pieces, the game picks up the bottom piece, instead of the (visible) top one, which is very annoying. - The game uses a timer to give you a score between 1 and 3 stars. You can still complete the puzzle when the time runs out. - The time is not saved, only the amount of stars awarded. - The settings are not saved. Muting the game, only for it to be unmuted later. - The interface is very minimalistic with little customization. - Feels like a cash-grab, only upside being the gorgeous artwork.  TL;DR: Only for people who really like dark fantasy and jigsaw puzzles.
After a lengthy exercise in pacing and lengthier deliberation, I've come to the conclusion that I can't with good conscious recommend this to others as its faults in my eyes were too irritatingly glaring for me to call this a read worth the money. Let me start off by saying that Stronghold: A Hero's Fate isn't a horrible addition to the CoG roster, in fact it had the potential to be one of the greats. However this potential is lost in a sea of selective inclusion, political promotion and the poor execution of sound ideas.    The premise is you're a <profession> who happens to get kidnapped by a monster and by miraculous or mundane means manages to put down your oppressor which entitles you to your own plot of land to build the foundations for your own Barony ect. While I am in love with the Idea of raising my settlement with my friends from dust into a mighty Barony that enemies would think twice to trifle with, I feel that the way in which the initial land was granted looked more like an all too convenient deus ex machina to register as an achievement. I feel more time should've been put into the narrative lead up of such a grand prize.  My next issue is with the way religion is forced upon the Player. You have a wide inclusive list of gender representation and pre-history family parental makeups, but when it comes to deciding whether you worship the gods or not the author is quick to jump in and slap down any notion of Atheism. I chose I have no shrine to any of the gods in my home and the next line was the author blatantly telling me that while I have no shrine, I still believe in the gods. No choice of "Even tho you have no Shrine, do you still believe in the three", the author just straight up dictates to you, the player, with no room for argument, in a choice game what your personal religious preferences are. This selective inclusiveness made my brow furrow. Would that same dictation be appropriate with genders, romantic preferences and parentage in game? No of course not, so why there? I could see if being pious was central to the plot, but through my extensive playthroughs I've seen that the gods are little more than glorified decorations that grant mundane favors for mundane situations with no real consequences except a relationship bar hit if your stats for the situation aren't up to par to deal with it without intervention. I went through my first playthrough without attempting to curry favor with the gods or asking favors and still came out the end a legendary Hero with a Statue dedicated in my Honor.  No reason whatsoever to step on Agency except to project in that regard.   My next issue is the romance mechanic. While it is possible to marry 2 people at once, you are heavily restricted in who those two people can be. For Instance My straight Character wanted two wives which would be Mallosian and Ari. However for some very odd design reason, you can only marry another predetermined person that has been trying to court your first beau. In the case of Ari this was my childhood friend Ebbin, another man. Obviously the terms of this agreement didn't appeal to me so I told Ebbin to go kick rocks as quickly as possible. In another playthrough I made a woman and romanced Ebbin to see if anything would change and it seems Ebbin, the npc, can have 2 wives but the player, the lord of the land must share their woman with another man. Excepting if they are a woman/man, they can have 2 husbands with Cronos and Kingfisher. While if Mallosian is the one courted, they have to marry her and her alone even tho she marries another woman if uncourted. See there's that selective inclusiveness again. It's a great Idea, but very poorly executed. And furthermore, even if you do marry 2 people, spouse 1 is always seen tending to spouse 2 while you're little more than a third wheel. This is especially glaring when it comes to family which brings me to my next complaint.   Now let me start off by saying here that I never chose the adoption option as Man/Woman I wanted a scion born of my blood to carry on the legacy I built. My issue with this is each and every time it was 100% a girl. Now I don't have an issue with having a female heir, in fact it was quite a refreshing take on things my first 3 playthroughs. However here is where our Issue comes into play-- It seems the only way to have a male heir born of your blood is for your daughter to choose to become a man on her naming day (a day where she chooses her adult name). Now while the author has the right to build their world as they please, I as the player and consumer have the right to voice my opinion on how I feel about the content. For me the the bloodline heir felt like a very shoehorned noninclusive, disrespectful and inappropriate underlying agenda. When the child was born, there should've been a choice when you are naming it whether you had a son or daughter and on its naming day there should be a choice whether they choose to be identified as man or woman. I don't think it appropriate that the author make that choice for the reader in what is supposed to be the readers tale. Also your second choice for heir, the shoehorned protege is always female with no room for argument from the player. I'm not too vexed about that because I'm not going to choose a protege to succeed me anyway when I have a child, but yeah definitely some glaring statements better left unsaid that detract from the entertainment element of the game going on there.   My last complaint is with the way my personal family with my partner was portrayed in game. There was none. After my spouse had my child or I had a child in a love triangle, the other person/people had zero interaction with the child unless they were teaching her a lifelong profession in which they gave the same lines whether they were the parent or not as  if the child was a good apprentice. It was as if I was a single parent teaching my child the ways of the world all alone and what was supposed to be my spouse was little more than a delivery device. I mean there is a throwaway line right after the birth that your spouse is a caring mother or father, but thats the extent of that. The rest of the time you're always alone with the child, molding them to take your place or find their own way. I didn't like that, felt very disconnecting. It is a great idea, but very poorly executed. Should look at the Great Tournament 2 and Lords of Aswick to see how to do the family thing right.  But yeah that's the extent of my complaints on why I can not personally recommend this particular game as an enjoyable read.
While I have no problem with the "Play as male, female, or non-binary, gay or straight." line in the description, which is a recurring theme in the choice of game series, to each their own. Afterall you don't have to choose any of these options for your character.  In this game in particular this "Inclusiveness" feels forced to the point where one of the characters is an androgene and one of the possible love interests turns into the token lesbian couple. The reason why this bothers me so much is because in all the other CoG I've played this is handled with a lot more subtlety, rather than this on the nose display of how liberal we all are. If this is something you might struggle to read past, be warned.  Otherwise this is a perfectly enjoyable game with a ton of options for a customised playthrough, which are usually quite hard to find these days. Even if most of these options are just window dressing with no real impact on the progression of the game.
This is a extremely paper thin story, not only is there little or no depth to anything. You make like 1 decision then jump 7 years and make 1 one, continue until your old and tired. Most if not all choices you make are so completely meaningless. It taunts in game that you cant make everyone happy yet it was extremely easy making everyone happy.
Good idea for a story but well the story was terribly done characters where boring and annoying.
i have played through several times on other stories by this creator and the story element for this issue is just far too boring in my opinion. It made itself much harder to grasp attention and even though it had some creative language it wasn't explaining well enough for me to enjoy the beginning sequence unlike other Choose Your Own series they have done.
Death Collector is a very interesting game by Choice of Games. A 300,000+ word interactive novel makes for a story that can be rather in-depth and full of choices - telling us a tale worthy of being remembered.   Now see... Death Collector is memorable. The story has great depth and sets up an interesting world narrative that you end up thrust into... but it feels like it lacks in many aspects in more ways than I can really grasp at for particulars. The story is intriguing, the basis interesting and rather novel. But... the ending feels rushed and many of your own options feel like they don't make much of a difference. I felt as though no matter my choices the ending seemingly would end up the same. It also doesn't really make me want to replay it either to find out if that is the case.   The story is well thought out, has depth, and I just wish there was more angles to have taken for who you were to make yourself out to be. It is a good story, but personally not my favorite Choice of Games game. It isn't like Choice of Robots or Hollywood Visionary. Choice of Games has made many great games through this and Hosted Games but this just... it lacks in many areas.
Most of the choices are petty and insignificant. The charaters are unlikable. And if author wanted to put words in the players 'mouths and force out some feelings that just aren't there, at least make them feel they MATTER in this story, which this game still fails at miserably. If you want to have a taste of what kind of quality Choice of games and Hosted Games have stooped to these days, just try this game.
interesting concept unfortunately the choices are poorly worded and can lead to your character doing exactly what you didn't want them to do. it also so stonewalls you into doing choices that you didn't pick for example you are given the choice to not eavesdrop but end up being accused of eavesdropping anyway. also makes your character do things opposite to what you want them to do regardless. at that point why are you playing a choice game with no choice?
Not the best work by this author. Choice of the cat was excellent. This... This is just mediocre. You're stuck in an awful, soul-crushing job. Everyone hates you. Sure, there's intrigue, and sure, there's some interesting ideas, like the cloaks, but the whole thing is a bit of a mess. There's problems where things are just mentioned as [script error], or something akin to it, rather than just the normal spelling and grammar errors. What skills apply to what are completely unclear, and the game is damn unforgiving about it. A character can have a high relationship, but still call you an idiot. If you've had a crappy office job that involves some manual labor, that's this game, except in this game, people also cut people's tongues out. I recommend Choice of the Cat instead. This is just excruciating.
dont buy this game, such a waste of money
I didn't even need to finish the game to know that the message it's trying to send is dumb. Why would Steam even approve games like this? I do play mature-rated games, but unlike other mature-rated games, this one is, like, 95% sexual. No one should play a game like this. Ever.
Basic dress-up game that you can play anywhere for free.  Comes with a story but not worth paying for.
Be warned, there are long and disturbing r­ape scenes, some resulting in the victim's death or mutilation. The game does this weird tone shift where it's all cutesy one moment and then it's nothing but torture and screams the next.
"This title features mature content that may not be suitable for all all audiences, including fictional depictions of graphic violence, polygamy, drug use, hypnotism, assault, and incest; both consensual and non-consensual graphic sexual scenes between adults featuring men and women, women with other women, multiple partners, machines, and fictional creatures."  It blows my mind how mildly they explain the fact that there is rape in this game.  Not mention of rape, actual scenes featuring depicting graphic rape.  This happens multiple times, twice in the first two chapters.  It is excrusiatingly long and there is no option to skip it.  It is horribly disturbing and it is made worse in the world that the story is in where women who are raped either must marry their rapist if they were a virgin and were only raped by one man, or if they weren't a virgin or were raped by multiple men then they are excommunicated by the god of this world (for adultery) and are kicked out of society.  I don't normally throw around the term misogyny, but when you have this be the way that women are treated, but if a man become a knight then he can have multiple wives (no mention of any benefit to female knights), then I have to assume that the game creator truly hates women.  I don't know if it gets revealed later that the god is evil or not, but I cannot even attempt to keep playing this game.  I am getting a refund.  edit:  nice to see that Steam wants to censor me explaining r-a - p -e being featured in this game
ALRIGHT LOOK You didnt come here for story. Dont lie you perverts.  But when it comes to these smut games... i have standards. If you have the mindset that "sex is sex" You dont belong here. Go back to the filth online flash porn games. I understand that people dont care as long as it gets their rocks off.  Well not me.  Sure the story is a bit bland, characters have little to no growth WHAT SO EVER. but at least its got the sexy bits right?  No. There is a line that must never be crossed... And that is R ape. R ape scenes in games are glossed over or are protrayed as evil acts. In this game... they are HEAVILY featured. In vivid detail. Sure the main character says its a bad thing... but literally 99% of the rest of the world acts as if its not only ok, but its an every day thing that people have learned to accept as a fact.  Thats disgusting.  I can not support a game that so grotesquely promotes self indulgent tendencies, even if its from the antagonists point of veiw. AT LEAST ADD A WARNING/SKIP. But no, this a jrpg written for filth. And we cant have standards when it comes to porn.  This is why pornstars get such a bad rep. Because people associate this kind of filth with all porn. If you get your rocks off to r ape, then you are a disgusting piece of trash and you should be ashamed of yourself.
This game is boring as sin. The dialog is just 4 characters just saying the same thing over and over to each other. The characters are predictable, and all have the same personality. I read other reviews saying that it's grindy, but the real grid is the boring dialog.  The combat is boring and one dimensional. It's more of a chore than a fun aspect of the game
To much grind You cant just make any female character  
This game isnt exactly what I expected it to be.  Though I havent finished the game yet. There are things I do and dont like about this game. The graphics are nice, the music is good.  The story is good in some aspects and bad in others.  For example. As the story goes you become attached to the Characters and through the story they bond.  The downside is   You cant choose who you marry.  The game has set characters lined up for you to marry and you cant decline or choose.  The combat is to easy in my opinion, there really isnt much of a challenge to the fights.   My biggest issue with the game is the mature content.   I like mature content in my games but what I consider mature isnt   quite the same as the devs of this game.  The first wife 'Aster' aquires is by far the most mature. She looks like a grown woman, talks like one, acts like one for the most part.  I havent finished the game but as far as Ive gotten it seems like his wives only become more and more immature.  For instance.  The second bride looks, acts, and talks like she could be a young teenager.   Part of marrying the wives is to have sex with them and then the game considers you married.  Thats my biggest issue with the game.  Im not into kids, or teenagers and I really dont like mature content being presented as teenagers.  The game at the begining says all characters are 18 or older but they arent drawn that way. They dont talk that way,  they dont really act that way, and they dont sound that way.  Im not sure if I'll finish the game or not considering I found myself trying to get through the mature content scenes as quick as possible because the second wife seemed to immature and child like.  I wont go there, no apologies.     So over all the story isnt bad with a few exceptions, the graphics are nice, the music is good. The fights are to easy, and the characters in the mature content are not exactly 'mature'.  The lack of mature characters is the worst part of it for me.  So for now, I dont recommend this game. 
Very light RPG elements (basic stats an 3 gear slots) with a somewhat entertaining story. The core gameplay is repetitive, the combat UI is a nuisance (mouse curser placement gets resetted). Explicit scenes are presented via one picture (which is modified slightly over the course of the event) and text. The whole setting and experience is centered around the main character, every aspect falls into place to justify his actions. No NPC is jealous or protective of their relatives etc. The gaming experience might be worthwhile if that scratches your itch, for me however the cheap way to justify very questionable and unavoidable actions of the main character ("she is no human, so it's OK", "she secretly likes it, so it's OK", "she just looks young, but is actually way older, so it's OK") sour the overall impression severely.
I liked this game, but the biggest turnoff for me is the insidious social justice taking place in its plot. It's like a meat eater profusely apoligizing for eating a hamburger, no, for even wanting to eat a hamburger. It's sad and really makes me want to just close the game and give up. There's a reason people play H-games and it's to enjoy a fantasy, not be told that the fantasy is wrong. This game is so rote with social justice, such as, "I wont have sex with you when you tell me I can, not unless you say you like me too." Really? So consensual sex isn't alright anymore? This runs alongside some deeply disturbing non-consensual scenes. And all along the game keeps reminding you that the hero is like the villains, but not a villain, because he is socially conscious. It's so apologetic, after awhile you're like, why did I spend so much on a game to moralize to me? Especially a hentai game? Why? Does it help the developers sleep better at night? Let it either be a H-Game or regular game, but don't try to be both. Trust me no feminist is going to play this game and advocate it as being elightened. The developers might feel better, maybe they can look at their mom's without feeling guilty, but it's not changing anyone's mind on why people play H-Games. There's a reason men play these games, to have a liberating fantasy. The reason why I finally quit this one is because I don't want to be preached to about how having a fantasy is wrong. I just want to FAP to some risque stuff. This is my private pleasure. No one else needs to know and I don't need someone advising me it's bad and telling me I have to think good thoughts. My advice, move along to something more Hentai and less holier than thou.
Lame
Evenicle is an odd amalgamation of a game. On the surface, it's a harem anime with the small twist that those involved in the harem actually want to have sex and deepen their relationship with the main character. Below the surface, it's a game about human desires and how they're both helpful and harmful to the human condition, providing a (mostly) thoughtful look on the nature of desire and the role it plays in human society. Beyond that? It also touches on some sensitive subject material that it does not handle well.  At it's core, Evenicle is a JRPG that takes a lot of influence from the Dragon Warrior series. Combat is turn-based with a turn-order bar displaying who is going to take their actions when, and in combat you only see the monsters and the attack-effects of your characters instead of their models. Instead of mana, your actions expend a resource called BP, which charges one point every turn and carries between battles. Skills can be equipped and switched out with a point based system, and you gain more points to use more skills as you level up.  Perhaps most surprising is the lack of any real healing in the game. The healing items you get are essentially limited to full-heal elixirs and the more you have in your inventory, the more they cost in the shops. You don't get any healing abilities until about a third of the way through the game, and even then it's a one time use per battle and costs a significant amount of BP, making it far more efficient to simply damage race all of your opponents.  Ultimately though, the combat is dirt simple with very little in the way of surprises. At most I could say there were two bosses (both optional) that required a bit of thought and smart use of skills to overcome, but the random encounters rarely amounted to more than using auto-attack, and most of the story and mid-bosses fell quickly so long as you came into the fight with full BP and unleashed everything from the start.  That said, an RPG is almost always held up by its cast of characters and story, and Evenicle starts from a pretty interesting place.  The main character, Aster, lives in a world with rules enforced by a divine power that allow you to marry and have sex with one, and only one person. However, on the island where Aster grew up, he was taken care of by two women who both want to marry him. As that isn't possible, the only way he can make that dream a reality is to become a knight, which will allow him to take multiple wives depending on how many promotions he receives.  Along the way, he get embroiled in a complicated plot about a secret society working to overthrow the established governments of the world and has encounters with a colorful cast of villains, but amusingly enough, Aster's first and usually only thought on his mind is accomplishing enough so he can marry more girls. That's not to say the story is shallow or uninteresting, because it's neither, but it's often of little consequence to Aster himself.  At his core, Aster is a shameless and blatant pervert and makes no secret of his goals. However, because of the world he's in, his type is actually a bit of a rarity, thus making his attitude seem charming and sweet towards the girl's he's courting rather than creepy as he would normally be the case in a traditional harem anime.  The characters he meets along the way and those who join his party are nicely varied even as they fall into traditional harem-anime stereotypes. You have a tomboy type, a shut-in smart person type, a princess type, and a 'we swear she's of legal age' loli type. The party dynamics are fun and interesting and the characters all play off of each other pretty well. The fact that they're openly interested in sex and don't hesitate to engage in it with the main character is kind of refreshing in a sense, considering how often the harem genre tends to be all fluff and no substance.  But what about the sex itself?  Unsurprisingly, in a 35+ hour game, there is a lot of sex. The art style of the erotic scenes range from passable to great, and with ten different romantic options to pursue, you're more than likely to find a character and scene combination that works for you. Most of the scenes are fairly similar though, both in their dialogue and their pacing, and I found myself skipping parts that got tedious and repetitive. There were, however, some outliers.  One of the core 'rules' of the world is that anyone who kills or has sex with more than one person gets a black ring on their finger and is branded an outlaw. As an outlaw you can't have children, you can't harvest or cook food, and anything you try to 'gather' will produce nothing. Naturally, outlaws make up the majority of the villain’s foot soldiers, but the world quickly shows the 'flaw' in this outlaw rule right at the start when an outlaw gang kidnaps a village girl, drugs and rapes her, forcing a black ring on her finger before Aster manages to save her.  On the one hand, it's an effective way to set up the central conflict of this world. On the other hand, it's also the first scene you see in this game, and it's far from the only one. Six times you're basically forced to sit through these rape/gangbang scenes. They're not preventable in-universe and you can't really skip past them, either. Two of those six times result in a rather grueling and bloody death for the one being raped, and all of this is in incredibly sharp contrast to the otherwise lighthearted and erotic theme that the game sets for itself.  The ability to stomach such things like rape, blood/gore, hard vore, and castration (thankfully not visibly shown) is going to vary from person to person, but all of them were a very sharp departure from the game's normal tone and really affected my enjoyment of the game itself, leaving a bad taste in my mouth even after I'd finished it.  To be minutely fair, they do try to take the subject of rape seriously, showing the paranoia and trauma of the victims in the aftermath, and in a way, the black rings the victims acquire can even be considered symbolic of how real world victims can be ostracized by society just as much as the perpetrators, but they don't do enough with it to justify the gratuity of the scenes themselves, and more than a few are simply there for shock value rather than being significant contributions to the story or the world. The vast majority of the scenes are romantic, lighthearted, and (mostly) consensual, and Aster himself always takes the view that sex should be enjoyable for both parties, but that does make the times where things veer into darker territory feel all the more out of place.  Unlocking all of the scenes in the game is a surprisingly easy task. When it comes to going back and finding things you've missed, Evenicle is generous and resets all of the flags you could have bypassed the first time through so you can get them once the game has finished, making multiple playthroughs unnecessary. Moving at a steady pace, completing everything in the game took about 45 hours, so I would say that it's worth the AA pricing. There aren't any real choices in the game so to speak of and the few choices you do get tend to be pretty blatantly 'right' or 'wrong' and picking the 'wrong' one ends the game prematurely before bringing you back to the choice.  In conclusion, Evenicle is a stock and standard RPG propped up by a clever story and engaging characters with some tasteful sex sprinkled throughout, and brought down by some deeply uncomfortable sex scenes, poor handling of sensitive subject material, and a rather shallow combat system that was more of a chore than entertaining in its own right. While I didn't regret the purchase, I doubt I'll be returning to the game anytime soon.
This is a better game then it should be but...  The game's far too elaborate and long for a porn/hentai game. Like it takes at least 2 hours between each chapter for you to marry n fuck a character which holds the most minimalistic and barebones sex scenes ever (still images describing more than you see) which doesn't even have dubbing!  https://youtu.be/WgViSEK5XuU  The game's strangely all 3D, the story'll leave you confused of where to go and thanks to the lack of an objective screen you won't get much in-game help.  The monsters are weird and lame, the story's convoluted n dumb with fake choises as in after you pick the wrong one it'll play out a scene (usually kill you) then revert back to the moment just before you picked the wrong one, forcing you to do the right one.   With the sillly plot of you needing to marry everyone before you fuck 'em you're very limited in who you can bone in the lamest positions as well. Since the game didn't have the balls to let you become an outlaw and try to fight the pathetic reasoning that someone that bones multiple people before marriage is some pure evil being with logic to redefine the lands laws instead you're out trying to stop a war.  Also half the people you bone in the game do not look legal and they're bleeding because it's their first time. Like I don't wanna see that. The good thing about hentai is supposed to be the fantasy, right? Not the realism so you should embrace it and not have women bleed on their first time all the time coz no one wants to bone a woman on their period. It's not hot.  Though on the bright side the death screen's nice (though not explained well) and is quite forgiving, making the games complexity not very brutal on you.  Like you can play one-handed even though you won't be seeing much "action" throughout the course of the game
This game has a lot of potential that, in my opinion, falls short of being great, or even good. The RPG mechanis are decent, but equipment and ability build options are non-existent, so the build comes down to "you got a better sword, so equip it." It's not a bad RPG, really, just not really good. The fights are super simple but grindy so the game does feel artificially slowed down a bit (not that that is anything new for RPGs).  For me though, what really ruined the game was the writing. As you may have guessed the main character is your generic harem protagonist, except he is agressively perverted. That one sentence describes every character interaction between at least the first 4 party members (I haven't gotten any farther than that). All of the female party members basically see this protag who says he wants to touch their chests and they naturally want to have sex with him and don't care if he cheats on them (which he does or tries to do just about every 5 minutes). Unfortunately, none of the party characters have any more character than this, and the few mildly interesting characters are small side characters that have little presence.  The game is decent (even if it progresses slowly), but for me the lack of any writing for the main characters kinda ruined the experience. If you care about characters or story I would say avoid this game. If you are more interested in a mindless RPG and the "plot", then you may really enjoy this game.
[b] The Writing Kills It. [/b]  Man this game is damn weird, bad, and cringy. It's like netori but its not at the same time because the characters just don't give a damn if the MC fucks someone else and they're just unnaturally attracted to him for calling them cute. Also the writing is so bad *dramatic music* "I think what you're doing is great. I love you" Despite meeting a few days ago. The guy doesn't even have any redeeming qualities for fucks sake. I'm sorry but I can't see how anyone could like this considering you're supposed to take some this seriously. I get its harem but at least make it believable.
Bought for VR.  Yes, it works with a gamepad but awful wheel support and no in-car cockpit view kill it for me.  Hope this gets sorted as it could be a great arcade racer for VR fans.  VR is the only way to play driving games now in my opinion.
I wanted to like this game. I really did. I grew up on arcade racing games, and I'm a big fan of VD-dev. They did some amazing black magic on Nintendo handhelds, all the way up to the 3DS. But this game's otherwise fun handling model has a fatal flaw: if you turn just hard enough in a corner, you can spin out with no way to counter-steer out of it. Given the difficulty and behavior of the AI, you'll probably never catch back up if you didn't have a big enough lead. The cups are structured very lazily, too. The first cup is 9 races long, and it doesn't look like you can restart from the beginning, which brings me to yet another problem: the clunky menus. Who thought selecting an option, then holding A to be able to make changes to an option was a good idea? If there's a way to restart a cup from the beginning, it's not intuitive or prominent.  I seriously hope it's not too late to make changes to this game, because I think it'd have some real potential if they polished it some more. But as it stands now, I can't really recommend it.
dogshit
This game is nice in graphics and in tracks, BUT The REALLY CRAPPY cars the game gives you either allows you to turn a little eaiser or speed up a little bit more quicker. YAY for beginning of the game.   I have gotton through one championship and the second is really challenging, I am giving up at this point. the turning of the car's just make this game HORRIBLE to play.  Its like playing a racing game with car's that do not wish to turn when you get to a corner.  Im putting a negative on this game as the game works hard to go agenst the player. You can win if you choose to only speed up on the right type of track but this game Its annoying me far too much.   Uninstallling and forgetting this forever.
The game is OK but needs lots of improvement. Starting with lack of content and there is no map editor. The User interface  could use a major face lift. I'm sorry but since these issues haven't yet been addressed I won't be playing this game any time soon. In fact I have already uninstalled the game and will not reinstall It unless the gameplay improves.
I have played many, many city builders. This game is not ready for play testing. There is no in game info to explain how to build up an economy. Even things that should be obvious like how to build a selected building are very counter intuitive. I managed to plop houses a farm and a mill but the rules for placement of beyond houses needing roads are a mystery.  Bugs like a freeze-on-load I can forgive.   Zero explanation as to where buildings can go beyond that they must go on ground (as opposed to on water?) + most buildings not plopping down with no apparent reason why... that combo makes this unplayable in its current state.   Some serious upgrades are needed and I hope the developer follows through with them because I would like to see a city builder in this style. I do not recommend purchase even for play testing until a lot more work is done here.
A game without content, solid evidence that a single joke doesn't make up for the absolute lack of content. It also doesn't even look nice, this shouldn't be on Steam... (It's boring as fuck.)
Ужасный геймплей, ужасный интерфейс, куча багов! Это даже не альфа версия! Как это вообще можно было выпустить в продлажу?!
Stolen freeware! Don't buy!  This game is free on rpgmaker.net and has been stolen from developer AmandaJackson.
I'll admit; I had high hopes - not because of the pornography, though. You see, I'm a huge proponent of strong security. I avoid websites that don't use HTTPS, I ensure all of my passwords are compliant with very high standards (sometimes even combining xkcd's password advice with standard "best practices" to wind up with beasts of a password! If only more sites would accept them...) So when I saw this game titled "Pu*sy Password", my hopes were that it would fall under the same standards for vagin*l communications as I have for most things - I'm talking using nothing short of TLS v1.3, high-grade elliptic curve cryptography, that sort of stuff. And, of course, with strong passwords as well, nothing shy of full compliance with Department of Defense password strength standards, at the absolute minimum.  So let me tell you how disappointed I was when I discovered there was none of this. There was no encryption, no strong password policies - not even any letters! All the passwords were just numbers, and the password hints basically gave away the passwords! I was able to crack most of them without even using a calculator! And the lack of encryption was absolutely unacceptable - a Man in the Middle attack would've definitely showed anyone on my network all the vagin*l communication that was occurring. The amount of effort that went into the pu*sy security here was abysmal, and it's unfortunate how the product suffered overall as a result. I was hoping to receive a product that could be praised for its strong policies on security and encryption, but instead I only have another example of how security is often overlooked.    ----------------------------- OK, serious review: it's a cheap asset flip and you can find better content for free. Also difficulty randomly spikes and fluctuates at times which makes for a discomforting experience. The achievements are also broken as well. All in all, meh.
Shame on you Steam. Why. i mean what the actual f****? 99.9% got achiv 1 and 0% got one of the other? .... seems to be broken if u ask me...
Achievements are broken. Not worth the money.
[h1]Broken Pu55y[/h1] So I cracked each of the math exercises which are available in this game. But only 1 f*cking achievement popped. I wonder how dev created that storepage video with the complete Hentai Gallery unlocked while mine only contains just 2 pictures. Seems dev went on silent mode, game is broken as hell, level select does nothing. Refund is worthless if already 1 cheevo unlocked. Dev, do something!
No nudity with explicit content (Hentai),No Topless Girls (Ecchi),No suggestive content. Just only calculate and 2 boring picture. Still i like “Hentai Puzzle” those games. Worst game. 2/10
this was the worst one
Reminds me of similar flash games, only worse and not free. Visuals are so bad you can't tell foreground from background half of the time. Oxygen is limited so you have to go fast, but even slightly touching a wall means death. Also, lots of aggressive fish.
This is a big letdown considering that the first game was a good and challenging puzzler. No challenge whatsoever in this one so dont waste 3 hours of your life.
Very fun game, can be beaten in 2 hrs but after that I can't get to the menu when I launch the game. Sad. (If you are mad about repetitive music don't ever play this game.)
This game looks like a first game after some tutorials.  First 3 levels are totally the same. You can rush through them without killing enimies. The final boss can shoot only in one direcation so if you will stay behing -- he will never damage you.  Even grenades have no range damage!  this "game" should not cost anything.
Pretty graphics, crappy gameplay.  Has potential though.
need to have tits or some clothes gtg
One of the worst and absolute LAZIEST snake games I've ever played in all my days (and I've played a ton of these snake games in my years)  The game has NO OPTIONS and EVEN NO WAY TO EXIT THE GAME!  You literally have to ALT-F4 Hard close the game just to exit the game!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D3TD6adg9I&feature=youtu.be  There is NO WAY TO DIE..   ..THERE IS NO THREAT.  ..THERE IS NO SCORE.  THERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT ZZZZZZZZ until you decide to quit.. and then the most action you'll get is needing to forcefully close the game to beat it!  You just closed the game!

the combat system needs some reworking because you simply cant win on some paths, even if you follow the dev guide to the letter.
This combat system is utter garbage. And with that i mean ITS THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN. Before I want to "play" such a shit combat system I rather click thru dialog all day.
I purchased this for more t1ts & a$$ than actual gameplay, & I got more gameplay than actual t1ts & a$$.  I mean it's okay for those that can figure out attack patterns & exploit weaknesses in them in turn based combat I guess,  but I came here to f4p, not think.
Since 4 if the 6 endings are inaccessible (even following the developers' player's guide), the play trough time is less than an hour. The player's guide created by the game developer provides incomplete details necessary to reach all 6 endings. While following the guide exactly as written, only 2 of the endings could be achieved.  Hence the game cannot be recommended unless you are satisfied in purchasing LESS THAN an hour of play time.
Same developer Same crap game as Demon King Domination:
The Good: I learned some fun facts about the occult. Interesting concept. The game requires you to close it a few times/talk to Yuno for the plot to develop, which is kinda neat (but gets annoying after the 4th time). For a full length game, I could see a forced break as a way to add emphasis to major plot points or ideas by letting them marinate in the player's mind.   The Bad: 'Chat' as a feature is a bit of an overstatement, and the game is (sadly) not funny. The dialogue manages to beat into the ground the fact that Yuno likes the occult, but I finished the game not really able to describe her or with any attachment to her. We actually physically meet another character, but... never see them again? What was that about?   In the weeds: I like to buy games with interactive gimmicks, but this game is a bit more on rails than most visual novels that don't advertise on that aspect. I'm not going to expect even hobbiest-grade AI at the price point of $2, but, unless I'm missing something, 'keyword entry' is even a stretch (it's really just a canned list of 60 exact match strings). I totally get that typing allows the interface to filter down the 'conversation' options (versus the player clicking from a list of those 60 topics), but.. how do those chats really contribute to the plot and character development in a real way? And why is the player going to ask about alchemy or tarot cards specifically without her prior mention of them?
"Ultimate Offroad Experience" is not found here and for the price its an epic flop you can get spintires original for about $15 or under and its way friendlier on fps. too this game had some great promise but failed on delivery  if you want the real "Ultimate Offroad Experience" save yourself some bucks and have more fun and just get spintires
I bought this game on the day of release following the hype surrounding it from the developer. Unfortunately this game is not even at early access stage let alone ready for release. I requested a refund and got it within days, why, because this game falls short of my expectations, and they were great. There is no button mapping, no immersion, the game looped at start of tutorial and was unplayable. Really dev team you need to make sure that a game is playable before you release it, Would I ever try it again in the future, doubtful actually, given that there have been 2 patches since release and the reviews have been overwhelmingly negative.  There was an opportunity to create a great game in a niche that is missing and the mark was missed by a large margin.
I've never felt compelled to write a negative review until now.  This game feels like it should be free to play on a mobile platform. Perhaps I expected too much, having played Spintires, but I was sorely disappointed with the lack of free-roaming and seemingly pointless game mechanics - having to feed your driver a short distance into a very restricted trail being the most obvious.  The first refund I have requested on Steam.
Bigger let down than Celestia Vega's Christmas Porno. I'd rather spend 24.99 on Mexican food and rocket it out 30 minutes later than play this freakin game.
i have nothing good to say about this game work ever
I Honestly dont like it Refunding not the way they make it to look in the ads very bad deisign for the game...
I was really looking forward to buy this game and I did it. There aren`t many offroad simulators out there. good things :  good map size  some cars to chose (look good) the idea of collecting stuff (to eat, repair,...) suspension good simulated  bad things  bad physiks (ground has no real physiks for mud or rocks,...) bad car physiks ( dirving reverse is slow and weak)  no difflocks, winsh, choise of 4wd and 2wd you can`t get stuck nothing real to do  boring map  The idea is very good but there is a lot missing. The most importand things to work on would be realistic ground physics so that going offroad is a challenge. The map should get more varity. the cars should get stuck at some point. The trails should be diffrent difficult.  Maybe don`t work on the right look of fliying mud and so on. just that the tires spin in mud. mud has to be differen difficult.   Laiter on you (producers) could work on things like how real mud flieys and so on... Work at the basics That is my advise if you are not already doing that what I think.  For "customers" of the game: sorry for my bad english and wait with buying the game  At first i felt really bad for buying the game. But now i kinda don`t . I still belive, that this game is going to be great. Probably the team is very small. I hope it gets bigger. I would enjoy working on it when i have finished school. Good luck for future work Ice Torch Interactive... 
Not initially as advertised on date of review.  Definitely  a work in progress.  Graphics aren't bad but zero realism at all.  Controls are clunky and can't be remapped.  Why must one chase floating pizzas, fuel tanks and toolboxes?  Similar concept to mobile games.  There are better alternatives.
The game looked great on the videos and screenshots. Truth is its not the game I was expecting, audio far to loud and no matter what I did setting were never taken. No real support for any controller, Driving game using a Keyboard in 2019? Really? very limited play. Can imagine getting bored very quickly. Shame as the game originally shown promise so not sure how the made the promo videos as it not the game I've just tried. Do NOT waste your money. Hopefully it will get better with further development........
Waited for this to be released, man, I wish I hadn't. It isn't a Simulator, it's an arcade power-up based driving game. It isn't open world, you are pretty restricted on where you can go. The soundscape is horrible. It doesn't even look like the videos and photos on the store page. Seriously, unless this game is remade from the ground up, it will never live up to it's title. Read a few other reviews, and then go get Spintires, because that's the game you are inevitably looking for. I've never bothered to request a refund for a game up until I bought this.
Not a simulator game. Not the game they claiming to be. This was a total waste of money.
Not impressed with this game at all.  Gave it 15 minutes and ran to Steam support to return it.  Needs a lot more polishing before you waste your hard earned money on it.
It is not open world, its a 3d phone app game where you race to next gas can with a fuel consumption rate faster that 10 top fuel dragsters... and for some reason you must consume floating forest pizzas at a faster rate than your rig consumes fuel. Stay on the path or your truck doesnt move, no driving over rocks, through trees or making your own trail. Controls are not xbox style controller friendly. Needs to be either an open world sim game or arcade but not try to be both. Needs some big changes but i will hold on the the game and give it another shot at a later time if it gets some changes.
0% simulation, 90's arcade game chasing floating pizzas and gas cans to stay alive???? what in gods name were they thinking.. its only $7...just a pity its not even worth $2
This game is a huge disappointment. The controls are hot garbage.   For a driving game to not have adequate controller support is a joke. I was hoping this could be some fun competition for MudRunner. Ultra Off-Road Simulator 2019: Alaska lets you drive in the snow and other weather, which is something sorely lacking in MudRunner. This really had the potential to capture an entire fan base.  If the devs can't be bothered to include driving controls that have been standard for the last decade and a half, what's the point in making a driving focused game? Sure you can play with a keyboard and mouse, but for a game that requires precision driving to omit proper analogue support is a disgrace.   Driving games with bad controls are like VR with a choppy frame rate. You can still play the game, but why the fuck would you?  Quick edit: Holy shit these guys have published a racing game and they still can't figure out driving controls
Early access game. Not complete. Not worth $20 (not even the $15 I paid for on launch day). Not even close.
ok, i do regret getting this game.. its the nothing like the title would say it is. trucks look cool but do not feel like real trucks at all the sound is not so good at all either. it took me literaly 2 mins to judge this game. i tried to give it a chance but geez.. we all wanted a sim off road that we thought might compete or take over mudrunner.. well no matter what you do that isnt going to happen and that whats pisses me off the most. I usaully wont buy a game if there isnt a good footage of the game play is this is why..,, the map looks good but there isnt any digging into the ground. no mud. hitting a rock like a wall in places u should be able to crawl up easily... option. well there isnt any. maybe that because u just released it idk.. cant use my controller for some reason,,, camera is only rear of truck unless i missed something that moves it... then the dang pizzas and all that stuff just turned me off, there isnt anything simulation about this game.. theres no truck mod options, theres no gearing when driving.. i was actaully excited about this game too, kept checking on it.... its a damn shame i fell for the false advertisement.. you guys wont make it period if you dont change that title to arcade...
I didn't see anything on the steam page about updates in upcoming patches like the developer talked about in others reviews.  I guess he assumes everyone is going to read everything about his game from the forums and understand its a work in progress.  A ridiculous thought and shows a disconnect from the gaming community as a whole.  Also the developer seems to be a little on the unprofessional side with his comments to reviewers.  He seems insecure and can't help himself from reviewing the reviewer.  Just another reason not to buy a game produced by this guy.  As far as the game itself goes it is rough and needs lots of improvement.  I'm not going to go into them cause other reviews already have.    Most annoying part of the game right now is the sound of the engines.
Wow! What a steaming pile of crapola!!! Possible "diamond in the rough". But the "rough" is ROUGH!!!! To the Devs: Ask somebody who knows what an offroad game should be like. Then make your game like that. You can still save it at this point. It's got a lot going for it actually. You just need to get rid of some of the crappy gameplay and polish it up a bit. Actually...get rid of everything except the graphics and the physics(which are decent), and start over from scratch. Implement standard driving game controls. Redo the sounds completely. Remove all the stupid "grab this and that to keep going" dumbness. None of that simulates any kind of world, real or imaginary. I don't know what else to say. Other than you'd have to be a real idiot to screw something up that could actually be pretty good as badly as you've managed to screw it up. Good job dumbass!!! :smh:
Wow.... just wow, Game is horrible. Wanna go explorer nope cant climb this hill, oh look rocks maybe i can rock crawl nope its a wall, Car audio sounds like it was recorded in a garage (for all vehicles) game plays like a ps2 game, runs like a ps2 game, looks like a ps2 game. Its a ps2 game lol. would be worth 2.99 maybe 4.99 not 14.99. Sad i followed this whole thing just to be spit on. i lasted 7 mins. Couldnt take it so bad
Played 9mins of the game and quickly noticed its not a good game at all. Don't bother spending your $15 on this one guys and girls its a waste of time and money. Many other better off road games that would be worth spending money on. I had hopes because the video reminded me of Cabela's off road adventure or Motorm4x but nope nothing like them..
Very repetetive game, unrealistic and menus keep freezing
basically, off road 3d trials, set track start and end, 1 route, multiple levels. Not what I would classify as an actual simulator.
Looks like they're updating, but still can't recommend till it checks basic simulator boxes or changes the name to arcade. We'll see the direction they take.
The video and images led me to believe this was a driving simulator.  Instead, it is obvious that this game just about chasing tokens and collecting power-ups in a narrow band of terrain while being subjected to substandard audio, video, and controls.  No meaningful graphics adjustments, no sound adjustments, and a lack of ability to remap controls make this game unplayable at this time.
nope do not recommend this game it is utter trash good idea badly done its more like an early alpha then a full game no control settings in game can not turn of music and it is ear rape nasty trash music  not able to pan the camera around just point and drive no mud deforming etc played 3 mins was like pfft to this
First, I want to say that the graphics for the terrain are very well done, and there were moments when the game was enjoyable. Unfortunately, those moments where very few and far between.   The control mapper is very limited when it comes to using controllers. Using the PS4 controller for reference, you can’t assign functions to the R2/L2 and D-pad buttons.   Your resources deplete way too fast for you to actually enjoy the game. Trails lead to dead ends all too often. If you dare to go off the trail you end up stuck between trees or some rock. This totally kills the open world vibe the game wanted to set. Even with full beams night mode is still too dark see in.   The only time the game is actually fun is when you collect enough resources to drive around leisurely, but even then, the game doesn’t have enough appeal to hold your attention after leaving such a bad taste in your mouth.   It makes you wonder if the programmers ever play tested the game or even played a video game before.  
Cant believe i waited all that time for this garbage , THANK GOD there is a Refund option!   Ill stick with Mudrunner Thank You.
wow !!!  this game is disappointing at this point   !!!!  A+ for concept. F + on  execution !!!
Oh dear. what a disappointment. Maybe some point in the future it will be ready but its not at the moment.
Not really a simulator, there are better games for off roading.
(UPDATE) they did improve the steering wheel input which is nice still seems a bit  off like not much to do or really point maybe adding a first person view would help a lot i believe i do enjoy the mud look an damage you can cause its got lots of potential but still as of now doesnt seem much of a full game i know its still new but with some good updates there is hope for it   well i dont play on keyboard but when i see a "Simulator" game id imagine it to feel like a simulation. absolutely no way to change any controls it even says in loading screen change gear mode to manual in settings this game is so broken on many so many levels unplayable with a wheel very Disappointing maybe playable on keyboard i didnt try but if your gonna use a wheel do not bother to buy this game unless they update this
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// SORRY DEVELOPERS.....do i can know why after 15 re-edition of this EEP many version like this suffer of the same problems????????????????????????????????????????????. I have spent 53 euros for to see the same problems i have got with EEP 13????? When you lay down a track on a surface that you have prepared using editor the piece of track become pratically unmodificable cause a very annoying question about the angle of the piece.....but my god ,why in the EEP 12 i have not this problem and now i find it another time into EEP 15 ??????? It is possible that noone of you have noted this error?????? And now what i can do ? I don't want my money back i want this EEp 15 working right...is simple. I WANT THIS EEP 15 WORKING LIKE EEP 12...it is too much to ask??????? DO SOMETHING AND IN HURRY PLEASE.I cannot accept this error after so many EEP versions.
I hope you'll understand. This is good software but...I was trying to learn how to use it with eep videos on youtube and found that most of the models from those videos (eep 11) are missing. And I think that it is because those models were moved to shop on their site. Simple greed I think :( Hope I am wrong.  PS: Buy EEP13 instead it is much better. PPS: Succesfully imported all models from EEP13
It should be noted that the majority of the missions are only available if you have purchased the Nevada and Persian Gulf maps
You buy what you pay for.
I’d probably go with a mixed review if I could. It’s not terrible, but it isn’t that great either. I kind of liked the artwork, but it gets a thumbs down for the actual gameplay.   The game works like this. Complete a 5 X 4 jigsaw of a woman in a skimpy outfit. Skimpy means bikinis for the most part. There is no actual nudity. When you’re finished with the puzzle, you don’t just see a still image. Instead, the woman jiggles a little bit. There is a sample of this at the end of the video on the store page. The store page mentions 21 levels, but there are only ten women in the game. There are ten levels with a gray background image as a guide and then the same ten pictures are repeated without the background guide. The final level is the phrase, “Anime Pixel Girls.”   These are the problems with gameplay. When a level is completed, the game then starts the next level automatically. There should be some sort of pause so the next level doesn’t start until you’re ready. There is no gallery available. There should be a gallery available when a level is completed. There is no option to adjust the size of the pieces. It’s always a 5 X 4 puzzle. There is no ability to start from a selected level. You have to start all over from the beginning each time. In addition to all that, there was some sort of bug, so I wasn’t able to take screenshots using Steam. Not a major issue, but that’s something that should be fixed.  Final verdict. Not really recommended, but if you want to try it, wait for a sale. I got it on sale for 59 cents. That’s about what it’s worth.
The game is very SHORT. There are only 6 (SIX) CGs/Hentai pictures in the game. Also these scenes are EXTREMELY SHORT (they lasts exactly 1 sec) because there is not any text at all - just the picture. Also, despite that the game supposedly caters to female domination crowd - in fact that's a false advertisement. Developers just don't understand what this fetish is about (humiliation of man!) so the protagonist behaves just like your typical brazzers actor - as  a proactive and popular stud. There isn't even any footjob scene at all! Therefore this auditory is bound to be dissappointed as well. All in all this is very amateurish piece hastily made in tyranobuilder - and their audacity to ask for that any money is disgusting.  There are lots of works available for free with much better art and amount of content than this after all - which I would recommend instead.
Worst game ever.
Cheesy, short, and just kind of bad. If you just want a few naked pics, this will be ok. Don't even think of paying full price.
Too casual. Story without intrigues. CGs do not impress 
i am confused... wtf...
So.. This game was almost good enough to get a reccomendation. Love the pictures and the constant moaning. The style/humour of the game is just awesome!   But... It's so lazy put together, there's nothing to recommend sadly, even for the cheap price. The puzzles are there, but there's no progression or anything. No score screen, no overview of the puzzles on what you've completed or anything.. Just finnish a puzzle, bam next.. Nothing inbetween.   This makes me sad, as if there was actually some heart put into making the game a bear minimum of... A game. I would reccommend this without a doubt!  It's so badly put together that I won't even gift it to friends as a joke.
barf
Big fan of the series ever since I played the flash game as a kid. This however falls way too short for a positive review. It's 1 hour and you're done with virtually no replayability. Maybe with some updates and content addons it could be good, but until then, don't buy.
So..... Here we are...... 8 months later and no content to speak of. What the fuck did i pay for? They clearly have no intention to deliver this or they would have at least made some announcements around it. Getting retarded i love IO but this is a scam currently.
Kind of worthless as they don't contain anything. You get two co-op sniper challenge maps. I for one hate the sniper mode and don't even play it.
Sniper Missions are not full levels quit being lazy IO
This is fucking shit, spent money on sniper mission, better to go play free online sniper than this.
My account is not connecting to this game and i cant play this game too. What is the purpose of buying all this.....?
Bad joke.
i bought this! why can't access the new map?????????
First off this expansion is advertised as "The Expansion Pass includes two Expansion Packs that offer you new Missions, new Locations, new Sniper Maps, new Challenges, new Weapons and new Outfits". Notice the "Missions" part. Okay, so plural words mean that it will contain more than 1. Well seeing as Hitman 2 retails for $60 and includes 5 maps, that's about $12 a map. So for a $40 expansion pass advertised as "new Missions" we can expect about 3-4 new maps right? WRONG.   The new expansion pass will only offer 2 new maps. What a waste of $40. I should have just bought the legacy pack for HALF the money, $20, and would have gotten like 5 or 6 maps. So thanks IOI for tricking me into buying this expansion pass under the pretense I would receive new maps that were anywhere close to the price you were asking. Part of the blame is on me for not doing more research. The other part is on IOI for being as technical as possible instead of just  saying "HEY WE'RE ONLY GIVING YOU 2 MAPS FOR $40 LOL". They probably realized people wouldn't buy it. That's why they just advertised it as "new Missions".   If you don't have legacy pack yet, just get that. Its March 25, 2019 at the time of typing this and I haven't received my 2 $40 valued maps that I am expecting to be the size of the Wittleon Creek map. You know they're not going to be big maps. They're going to be nice and small and lack tons of value this way they can have a bigger profit margin :(
total bullshit got nothing added but took money
This costs way to much for just a small expansion like the first game had. They mostly used already existing maps. They could atleast let me kill Sean Bean. But no you rather hire an expensive actor to have the mission limited for 1-2 weeks... I will update this to a positive review if it's more then i expected. Or if you hand over Sean Bean to me right now.
Where is first season? WTF?
IMO you do not need the expansion pass. Just buy Hitman 2 Gold edition since the expansion pass is included in it already (atleast, this is what it shows in my DLC items in my games library). Im really loving the game, but the store page is just confusing for new players.  P.S. Hitman 2 Prologue is free, which grants people who own Hitman 1 the "remastered" maps from Season 1. It does not include any of the new Hitman 2 maps, so you will need at least Hitman 2 Standard Edition to play some of the newer content. But since the basic edition's content is very limited and the Basic + Expansion pass costs more than the gold edition; just get the gold edition.
can someone please tell me when this will achally come out.because if you get the pack it gives you weapons and stuff but not the levels
This is what you can buy if you click "Get Access" in-game. It doesn't give you story missions, will download and install maps from season 1, will give you some useless stuff.   If you want the actual game, this ISN'T IT. They've put it in that menu only to sell it (They're hoping that not everyone will refund it)
i got hitman 2 and the expansion pass and i did not receive any maps
CANT PLAY THE NEW MISSIONS AFTER DOWNLOADING EXPANSION PASS! HELP!
Despite the purchase, the new missions don't get unlocked
Purchased and still cannot play campaign for H2... Frustrating
Claims I don't own the pass...
boring and akward to play, many better games out there
It seemed alright but it was glitching for me and I didn't like how you can't stack (especially air and navy)  I returned it.
Not worth the price I paid for it.   Cons:  - Cannot stack armies... one Hex should cover about 100/100KM.. no way you can only fit one army in that space.  It gets very crowded in Europe, almost impossible to execute a blitzkrieg through ardennes - Airplanes require a hex of their own: very unrealistic... airplanes depend on airfields, it should be implemented as such: hexes wirh airfields from where you can launch raids  - Aircraft carriers are seriously underpowered. In real life a carrier is much more potent than in this game - Bombers are seriously underpowered, the ability to creata chaos and disorganisation by tactical air raids is not taken in consideration. Any artilerry position is very vulnerable to air attacks.  - Transport and operational transport: I seriously doubt that you need about 10% of your national income (20mpp) to transport an army between two points - Tank attacks are inneficient against surrounded infantry. No lessons learned from Stalingrad?   All in all not bad, but not worth the money, I expected something more than just a clone of the first strategic command.
If you like playing Axis and Allies or Risk, you may like this game. If you play World in Flames or strategic command: war in Europa there is a big chance you will not like this game. World map, Turn length, production and research, the hole game feels like a bad and cheap mod of sc3: war in europe. No worth the price You cant play on the pbem server with more as 2 players.
i will Buy it again if i Hear about the controls/ scrolling smoothing out a bit .. feels just to clunky when all i want is Compfy   its almost the perfect ww2 game (for me) .. but just a few minor things holding it back   - I will update this review- because i want to like this game   
Lots to like but in the end I can't enjoy a game that takes 2 min21 seconds for all the AI factions to have their turn.   Pity.    If that doesn't bother you you'll likely enjoy.
When I caught a first glimpse of this game during an Agrippa Maxentius livestream, I was very impressed at the graphics, and especially the fact that a player could take control of a single country at a time for either the Allies or the Axis.  I was stoked.  I waited a few days after the release day to see the initial reviews, and they were pretty much all good.  So, I jumped on it and purchased.  Unfortunately after about 2 hours of intensive play, I have to say that I came away completely wanting.  I am going to first ignore the fact that unit counters have no unique unit names labelled on them (such as "Grossdeutschland", "Panzer Lehr", "1st SS Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler", I could go on and on but I am sure you get the picture here ...).  The counters themselves are nicely rendered, I must say.  It is too bad that combat feels so weird and clunky, turning a blind eye to the fact that you are conducting battles at the corps and army level only.  You could say a lot of this game is weird and clunky.  Requisitioning new units feels the farthese thing from intuitive, and I end up feeling like I am talking to that weird uncle at a family reunion, in attempting to purchase an extra tank.  I think I'll go back to my John Tiller Kharkov '43 Gold, and see if I can recapture Kharkov yet again with Liebstandarte AH, Das Reich and 6th Panzer Division.
Because the game randomly places pieces rather than mixing up a solved board, 50% of all generated puzzles are impossible to solve.
This is a waste of time and money. The idea of a NEET simulator is the best part about this game. There is absolutely nothing to tell you what things are or what you're supposed to do. Once you do begin to play to try and figure things out, you very quickly realize that the game is even more excrutiating than watching an actual NEET spend his day doing nothing.
No way to change resolution. The game is very tedious. Watch as your "NEET" plays games and earns money. That's it really, just watching and listening to a typing sound.  https://youtu.be/9ymFYUXn9C4
Actually it is a wonderful tool,and l have to say it is easy to use it to crate pictures.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ But l meet some awful bugs .l can't save my project and i can't export the gif.

Good software, but works VERY slow on MacOS, can't even draw things smoothly.
Very cool concept! Also, very frustrating. Concepts are simple, yet this program works VERY VERY slow with my tablet and pen. Drawing is not smooth, the modes of drawing change constantly back and forth (free hand vs a point-to-point type line), and some times a line drawn is not registered at all. Undoing an action can take multiple clicks of CTRL Z when it should take one, and there is no Redo option as far as I can tell. Program crashes when you add too many layers or spend too much time drawing one object. Drawing one simple thing with a tablet pen can take hours due to all the bugs in the program. VERY VERY frustrating, because this program has so much to offer and shows so much potential.
Impressed with it so far. I have always wanted to do pixel art, but struggle to find the patience. This seems to speed up the process quite significantly.  Update - Seems pretty much abandoned.  This is a good program if you want to draw a stationary pixel art image. I wanted to animate a smoke explosion, but you can't make changes to the drawing mid way through. You can only animate the position and rotation of an object.  Sadly, this makes it pointless for me, so I'm changing my review.
HAHAHAHAHHAA this game is S*** it might be ok if it was free but its not even worth .10 cents
Absolute garbage.
I hate to say this. This early access game was not ready for release. The screen size keeps changing as I access things. All I can do is run forward or sidways. The alt key that is supposed to let you have freelook does not work. The guide needs work, as when the guide to me to access craft. I would not go off my screen after I did. As with all early access games, I expect some issues, but to be unplayable is not aceptable. The developer needs to get the game working alot better.  I would suggest not buying this game at this time. Give the developer some time to get the game more playable. I was going to do a first look for my YouTube channel https://goo.gl/r2uYrg  but was unable to do so based on the issues stated above.  Jadiwan
Mouse look doesn't work. Can't interact with the, mostly empty, pointless, environment. A waste of everyone's time, hilariously overpriced. Early Access garbage.  https://youtu.be/1YAXGxWxGFg
I wanted to find a game so I could masturbate with my friends, I had high hopes because the game cost money and I put my whole monthly pay into it, but this is like pornhub but worse because the only thing that came out of my snake were tears... How do I refund?
I'll ignore the actual gameplay for now, since there is too many problems with this game in order to actually try it out properly. This game is barely playable for more than a couple minutes. There are numerous problems with it, and it is rather worrying that it wasn't released as an early access game.  1. The game starts right off the bat, giving you no story, objective, tutorial or anything. You simply have to start playing. And when you lose, the game just starts over with no scoreboard or story. 2. The building tooltips can't be properly viewed. They are at the bottom of the screen, and everything except the name of the building will be outside the screen. This means you have no idea what the buildings do, nor how many crystals they cost. 3. The warrior bugs are hard to control, and will often ignore your commands to go scout on their own. 4. It is possible to start the game surrounded by enemies, resulting in an instant game over. 5. There are no options. You can't change resolution, cap the framerate, or run in windowed mode. 6. Thirteen minutes in the game started freezing every other second, forcing me to use task manager to close it.  7. The game freezes every time I try to exit it.  8. Progress doesn't seem to save, so you can't continue after exiting the game. You have to start a new game if you do. (This could however be because I am unable to exit the game without using task manager. IDK.)  For now, I cannot find a single redeeming quality about this game, and thus I cannot recommend it. At all.
[h1]Dead game[/h1] Developer could not solve simple errors with it in the time he was active.
I feel like they were really trying to make a good game, but the skill was just lacking.
bought it cuz its so cheap. turns out its so cheap its terribly done. guess that's as much as it should worth. first 3minutes into the game and i regretted this. WHO MADE IT?!
Pretty much unplayable ... couldn't save progress.  Cheap but still not worth it.
This game is clunky, has a very unfinished feel, and is overall not fun to play. Skip this and keep playing Day of Infamy for all your ww2 FPS needs.  
This should be early access and mouse is not supported as a controller.
Difficult to play. Feels unfinished.
I really wanted to like this one due to being a promising single-developer -game, but the character's awkward movement and frustrating gunplay were too much for me.
This game is... Painfully bad. Like seriously bad. For a solo development game, the character models look like garbage, dialogue does not match the text AT ALL, easy to bug out of the map, UNABLE to save during points in the mission, FORCING you to restart over again and again.... No just no.  Unless this game gets some serious love, avoid it.
No.
I liked it at first especially given the super low price. But after a few hours in, it just become too tedious and frustrating and rather boring to say the least. Just not enough here to keep my interest. The voice acting is truly awful and the game just feels flat and increasingly repetitive, with some of the mechanics proving just too cumbersome to give it one more go! Sorry.....
[h1] Front Too Far: Normandy  [/h1]  [b] Update: [/b] With no comment from the developer about this game, it is safe to say we shall not see any improvements at all for a while and to avoid the developer until their reputation improves.  [b] TL;DR[/b] The lack of attention to details often portrays the problem with solo development. The mundane everyday task of working on a project creates a lack of ideas which leak into view when the project is released.  Modern fundamental gaming options such as having an options interface in the main menu have not been included.   [i] This review will contain spoilers [/i]  [h1] The Review [/h1]  [b]Gameplay[/b]  The enemy AI is often hit and miss, with detection often obsolete or exploitive. You can be 100m of the enemy and have them not see you, or you could be behind bushes and they would still be able to see you. Enemy AI is extremely aggressive when in numbers and will rush you regardless of the situation even if you try to suppress them. Coupled with poor controls and this quickly becomes a nuisance. Weapon accuracy becomes another problem as both weapon condition and the lack of hit detection makes the even most elite of players doubt their skills. You will often find yourself using all of your ammunition in combat due to your shots missing even though the crosshairs are lined up and your weapon condition is above 90%. Since the only way to hit enemies is by luck or close quarters, you will inevitably be shot. Interestingly enough, there have been instances where enemies ignored me outright in the middle of a firefight, to perform a turn and then continue to shoot. As your health goes down, you will be notified that your health is low, and you should use items. The problem with this is that there is no quick selection or quick heal key and therefore you will be paused in the inventory whilst the game continues, with enemies rushing your position. The developer has stated that this is intentional.  For any friendly NPC, there are a few instances where the AI makes you feel like you are surrounded by stormtroopers, forcing you to expose yourself to enemy fire or not have to engage the enemy at all due to their ability to engage without taking damage. At times, you may not want to shoot at all as it is difficult to tell the resistance apart from the enemy. For instance, the character Zoe wears the same black clothing which is indistinguishable from a distance to the Nazi uniforms.   Missions are extremely repetitive and continue to expect them to be as the map appears to be quite large. I am 8 missions into the game, and it has been only fetching quests and ambushes. I honestly would expect a mission to defend the camp, however I can no longer play as I have encountered a mission which I believe to be the most ridiculous out of place mission yet. The mission is related to Devil Hill where you are forced to defend the area from 3 waves of bunnies that are each called “Evil Bunny”. You may ask why this is the case, however the NPC who gives the quest states that the hill is haunted, and this is the only explanation so far as I cannot find myself to finish this mission. The bunnies have red eyes and are completely black, however this does not make them scary at all. It is the sheer frustration of the number of bunnies, lack of ammunition, inventory management, and weapon inaccuracy that makes this mission impassable. The bunnies hop high enough so that you miss and spawn close to your vicinity in amounts of 10 so you will find yourself out of ammo and dying throughout the quest. This is made further frustrating with the poor saving system. Saving is extremely obnoxious, you are only allowed to save outside of missions which can be annoying as some missions can be large and you will be forced to start again.   Navigation in missions is confusing as you have a map, however there is no pointer in the map. You are given a compass however this is useless anyway as you cannot find out where you are facing. You have the choice of several vehicles to use to get to objectives most commonly the car and the motorbike, however these are difficult to use as they have no suspension and no third-person view. Furthermore, you cannot see the handlebars of the motorbike which limits responsive turning. The field of view in the vehicles feels quite limited and thus causes a lot of crashing.  The game features a trading system which is extremely expensive and thus obsolete. It is understandable that supply lines are probably cut-off, however items sell for very little compared to the price of buying. There is a lack of balance and you are better off looting weapons from the enemy. Some items do not even sell at the store and you are forced to drop them. Jasper’s maximum carry weight is 25kg which is fair, considering that it is a solo mission and you need to keep moving. This allows you to carry a fair number of weapons though it must be known that quest items have their own weight. When you are carrying too much weight, you will move slowly and will be forced to drop items that could be sold, however you are restricted on what to sell. Some survival elements involve a hunger system which comes into play later in the game. As of yet I am unaware of the dangers of having your hunger low, however I can probably guess that it will affect your health over time.   I was intrigued to see different weapon attachments and different weapons from the time, however these can be quite rare and easily missed. The most annoying factor is that weapons cannot be individually striped of ammunition but only the bodies of dead enemies, which leaves precious ammunition lost unless you pick-up the weapon. Weapons have a condition feature that affects weapon accuracy and take a fair bit of time to reduce condition, however it is annoying that you have to pick up the weapon to see the condition rather than see the condition of the weapon before picking it up.  [b]Atmosphere[/b]  When assaulting your objectives, you are presented with gleeful music which reduces the experience, especially since you are alone and surrounded by random Nazis spread across the map. Instead of feeling a sense of fear as if I could die at any moment, I felt as if I was in an adventure film.   Voice acting is very inconsistent and if you are attentive you can tell that it was outsourced, as the voices from different characters sound like they were picked up from different microphones. Zoe’s voice actor definitely is a culprit of this, as the voice sounds as if it has been picked up in a room whilst Jasper’s voice is quite clear. The French voice actors are hilariously bad, whilst the Germans sounded quite tactical which was interesting.   Graphical quality is budget and understandable due to it being a small project, however even with render settings on far it is quite clear that grass and trees render when you are at least 20m in front of them. Even more so, if you pay close attention to enemies far away, they are not even animated. On the other hand, I believe this was for performance issues.  I was surprised to see wildlife in the form of cows of which have been slightly animated and given sound effects. However, I have found that Jasper (the main character) has the ability to understand cows or that the cows have the ability to speak English as they all have the same statement that says “I don’t trust him…” which is the same statement made by the enemy when you get close enough.  [b]Conclusion [/b]  The story is very bland with retrieval missions and no obvious character development. There are quests that honestly subtract from the experience of the game, such as Devil Hill. I honestly wish that the developer will take ideas and implement them into the game as I like the concept, however the poor execution leaves much to think about for now. Noticeable bugs such as AI getting stuck or which music has been selected at the moment reveals the rough, unpolished interior.
Fuck this game.
I love this game, and this update is an awesome addition, but there's a part of it that just overshadows my experience of it and ruins the whole thing. Its about Zoe. Her character is great overall, but the way they kept talking about the topic of transgenderism just had me and my friends constantly roll our eyes. It was very, very preachy, and it didn't help that the opposing side of the arguments were presented by a character who was meant to be hated from his inception.  But this isnt even about my opinion of transgenderism or transgender rights or whatever the game brought up. It's how the game did it overall- the dialogue for all the transgender related events felt forced and cringey to read. Very little of it seemed or felt natural or consistant with the characters.   This is limited to a few events, yes, but every time i think about Monster Prom or boot the game up, i think to myself, 'ugh, am i going to get those events again?' Feeling reluctant or annoyed when i boot up a game means there's something wrong with it.
I love the base game. It's quirky, fun, unique, but most of all it has heart. This DLC seems to take all that care and throw it out of the window. From the get go, it shows, when the basic grammar is terrible with mistakes popping up in every other line. That shows how little care was taken. That seeps over to the writing as well. The base game is funny, and entertaining, whereas this drags on and on without a hint of comedic timing. In the base game, I love reading all the prompts, I don't speed run for endings, I just enjoy the fun. However, in this DLC, even I had to skip through some of the benign text that felt like it had been copy and pasted from somewhere else.  The art is on point and very much in keeping with the game, it's just such a shame the care wasn't taken to continue putting the love into this project that it originally had.
I really wish there was a middling option for rating.  For those who don't want to read a wall of text as to exactly why, from a critical standpoint the writing for the new routes seems more hit and miss than it was in the base game. The issues outside of that are minor.  But onto the main portion.  One of the more minor issues deals with some of the new voiced lines for the Coven. Certain lines make it clear the quality of the mic used changed. Outside of that there are a few cases of misplaced spaces, lack there of, and a handful of typos. However that is more an unfortunate circumstance than a rating dropper.  The writing. As I stated before it seems to have altered, and I'm not talking about the kappa sized elephant in the room. Not yet, at least. The interactions can be good, but are just as likely to come up short. Calculester is the best example of this. Too many scenes just seemed like altered repeats with different characters with him. Now the secret endings? His are fine. The item endings as well are mostly fine. As per the lunch scenes with the side characters those need work. Dimitri's lunch scenes, and scenes in general, are flat. One-noted. At least the Prince in the base game had some variation if you sat with him, which honestly made me grow to like him as a character. A kind of mirror to the player character since we ultimately are going for similar goals. Dahlia at least shows some variation, and the abusive relationship representation of a character shows how toxic that can be without preaching. That latter bit I respect.  Which leads us into Leonard. He's a strawman, yes. Those people are the extreme minority unless on certain sections of a website, yes. My problem with him is that there was too much success in making him the most hated character. It makes the Zoe routes a chore to get through. Honestly I just skipped the majority of Zoe's scenes if I already read them once due to him. I understand why the devs included him, I saw the comment on the discord. There are crazies out there and they wanted to bring shine a light on what was referred to in that comment as "neckbeard culture". His personality isn't quite just that though. It's an amalgamation of a number of different groups, and some of which happen to be at odds with each other. I get they feel they need to discourage certain behavior what with FBI statistics showing hate crimes being on the rise. I really do. But is a comedy game the best way to do it? It's a rather jarring shift when these scenes appear.  That said Zoe's route does show a decent way of resolving at least one of these issues and still keeping with the overall theme by means of the Wolf Pack in one of her secret endings that I will not spoil here.
why the fuck would an eldritch horror care about gender politics, im so dissapointed
I played the first game for so long. I’ve seen nearly every event in the game. I love the characters with all my heart (especially Oz, Valerie, and Damien).   I adore their personalities, designs, and uniqueness. I even find the simplistic, cutesy art style of the game to be just as perfect. Still the same fun, adorable game it used to be, but I now find myself cringing with every other event I play.   I really wanted to like this DLC, I really did, but the political themes in this are ten times more present than before (and I find all politically charged games to be this way, no matter what opinion it is.) They are nearly impossible to ignore this time around. They are so forced, obnoxious, and stupid.   Don’t waste your money, unless you like to be talked down to and told how to think with no subtlety, variation, or nuance.
I was fine with the casual push of political humor in the game but this DLC is getting pretty uncomfortable. I just want to flirt with an eldrich horror not get into fucking gender politics in video games inside of a fucking video game.  Plus it's not much content considering it costs half the amount of the base game and offers way less content.  EDIT:  TL;DR Leonard is low hanging fruit and just discomforting, Prince and Pack have redeeming qualities and fun interactions, Zoey's character is kinda clever but is just too surrounded by politics, and Valerie>Calculester.  ALSO WHAT WORLD DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO COMMENT ON THREE NEGATIVE REVIEWS?  Holy shit guys I can't believe a few negative review was enough for the officials on the discord server to comment on our (apparently other people think this dlc ain't great either) crap on a separate discord server, now when I first saw this I thought it was from some third party discord talking shit and would hold no ground in my review  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525805656930910208/547583743112642604/hmmmmmm.PNG [quote]3.  If you have liked the DLC, remember to give us good reviews on Steam:  https://store.steampowered.com/app/958370/ So far 93% are good reviews!  And surprise, surprise: the few bad reviews are because now there are more "political themes". And since it is not as if we were discussing tax policies... it is pretty clear that means some people don't seem to like the Zoe/Leonard thing either because  a) we punish so blatantly some very hideous attitudes (which to be fair we did before very clearly with the Prince's attitude or the Wolfpack's attitude... but maybe this time has hit a bit too close to home for some people?) b) we are so open on gender politics in regards of Zoe. This is interesting. We purposedly kept Zoe identity theme tied to one of her secret endings and kept it very low-key on the rest of events (so there are some mentions, same way it is sometimes mentioned Vera is adopted or Liam used to be with the Coven). Why? As long as it was something very important for us to include, we didn't want to define Zoe over her gender identity, as it seemed limiting. It was essential to treat the topic, sure; but it seemed unfair to make that her focus over the things she loves. So this is the interesting point: statistically, only 3 events (a plotline) really focus on this, from 150 events. And some people complain for bringing too much "gender politics". I don't know what to believe... but if you see smoke, there's normally a fire somewhere, u know?  So help us! Help our grrl Zoe! Give her love there to bury those comments! Just to be clear: if you want to leave a bad review, please be our guest. And we have no issue with bad reviews. You don't like the humor? Fine. You find the art uninteresting? Sure. Some reviews are a bit absurd (I don't like the game because there's too much text.... maybe don't buy a text-based game?). But these ones are a bit worrysome to us, as they hide a dangerous subtext to them. [/quote]  First off, no shit you punish blatantly bad attitudes, you aren't clever though, the prince was a chaotic neutral creep with a magic wang, the wolfpack is very similar and also has a side of being good boys, they both have something unique to them either way. Leonard is a caracature of maybe 1% of gamers where every situations answers are state the obvious, or state the social justice. I got to shoot bees at the prince, where is the shoot bees option for Leonard? No I just get to tell him "Oh people can enjoy the game their own way" or "Y'know you're kinda sexist." He's just sexist, elitist, duck boy and I hate him. As for the whole Zoey gender identity I don't give a damn, I just don't I haven't seen that ending but the idea of the idea that this cthulian being is actually trans is kinda clever. I just wish the rest of the dialogue was that clever.  Also you gotta love how I haven't nor have the devs brought up Calculester, he's a good boi but god I think he would have better served as a side character. As a side note I never liked any of the original political jokes like the wage gap joke, I just tolerated it a lot more because the ratio was more balanced. The main game has a lot less of the blatant politics than this DLC. The devs are actively begging for upvotes for their steam game, if this was fucking youtube people would think they're pathetic. They had three negative reviews and they just react like "Drown out the hate."
I love this game, the new characters are adorable.   But...  I do wish that they hadn't been so preachy with the Zoe parts and the Kappa.  It may have been bad luck with RNG but every part my friends and I had with Zoe had Kappa show up for a long wall of text relating to personal identity.  I was expecting one such scene, it is an important part of who the character is, but it completely over shadows the other parts of her.  Towards the end of our play through we were sighing and skipping past her scenes if Kappa came in.  I get he is a joke character but he pulls the focus away from the focus of the game, that being the cute monsters.
the has some problems and needs improving but overall i give it a 7/10 p.s the is not worth a high price wait for a deep sale
Was expecting a VN with some FPS elements, couldn't do either very well.  Got a refund since this is driving the Sex Sell market hard.
So I bought this game as a joke for myself and a friend. I love FPS games and thought that maybe some fat tiddies would make my favorite genre of game even better. It wasn't awful. But it wasn't good. I know it's a porn game and all, but that doesn't excuse the game to be crappy. It doesn't get a free pass to suck just because it has sex in it. Not worth the price of admission (I payed 10 USD). Just go play L4D with PHub playing on your second monitor.
It's censored. Also, the game straight up doesn't work for some people and apparently doesn't support ultrawide monitors. Also devs completely abandoned this game and moved to making another piece of garbage that will also probably look like 3d animations you'll find r34 websites.  Don't waste your money on this.
Not sure why this game has so many positive reviews, except maybe ANIME BOOBS?  Other than that, this game has horrible, clunky controls, terrible AI, pathetic weapons that handle frustratingly badly, and above all IT DOES NOT PROPERLY SUPPORT ULTRAWIDE MONITORS.  Everything about this game is frustrating and badly implemented.  Stop feeding money to devs who release already-abandoned games in a state of messy half-completion.
all the zombies have identical models, aiming feels slippery, the girls look tacky, some guns iron sights dont line up with where the bullet goes and last but not least the only challenge this game offers is pressing w and left click. its a great idea in my opinon and idve loved to play this long term but now all i can say is im glad i got my refund.
The 2D Art is really good, but the 3D Models really need an update, that why I refund :( If the 3d girls looks so beauty like the 2D Art I would buy it again.
The Steam version is censored... Why? The orignal version of the game, that is called Rape of the Dead is uncensored.
Trust me when I say this, you'll get more bang for your buck if you just skip this rubbish and buy Blood and Bacon instead.
This is the dumbest game ever made.  Created purely to make money off all the fapping little boys out there who are too young or too awkward or too lame or too ugly to get a real girlfriend lol!   Anyone who tries to review this game as having ANY merit whatsoever is just a joke.
Pro: -steam refund system  Contra: -the shooting feels like shit     -mousespeed while scoping is 2 slow -too easy -boring guns, stages and enemys
no no non nononono nonono
The gunplay and the hanky panky are just plain terrible. not worth it even half price, theres better games on flash sites..........
this game is in my opinion wierd i can not decide wether to be negative or positive. the game is definetly not for children with content in this game, the game works fine i had no issue with it, hoowever i feel like the content is a little repetative, in the story you prettymuch have 3 kinds of missions either survive hords, defend till dime out or reach a desination while beating waves at checkpoints. as a game it works but with little content the game was complete in 3 hours on easy and even then it was a chore to the point that i was just finishing the game so i don't need to play it again.
So on paper, and in reviews as it seems, this game is decent. In reality, everything this game does it does poorly.   I'm going to start off with what this game is mostly composed of, which is combat. And let me tell you, combat in this game is surprisingly awful. All the guns feel, sound and look like toys. Recoil while ADSing with them makes me nauseous, half the time I was trying to just hip fire to make it less unpleasant.  Guns in this game, sadly, are incredibly bland and generic as well. They all feel pretty much the same with the distinction between ARs, SMGs, Pistols, and shotguns. And only the last one feels somewhat powerful (sometimes). I guess it wouldn't be such a big downside if this game wasn't so reliant on constant, repetitive, wave-based combat. Now granted there are some "progression" missions where you progress through a map, but they are just as tedious as all the environments are incredibly boring and bland.  You also get 3 girls that "help" you in combat, but honestly, the only reason they are there is so that you can have secks with them to replenish HP of both you and the girls. Alternatively, you can wait for their HP to drain completely and watch them get abused by the undead if you're some sort of a weirdo.  When it comes to sexual content this game is brought down by the lack of any artistic design, and what we're left with is awkward animations and textures straight from oblivion, on top of that this game comes with complimentary censorship that is pretty bad. I suppose one positive is that there's a fairly decent amount of different scenes, and animations with different actors, like if you're into watching an anime girl get impregnated by a giant worm and then have her head smashed you might like this, otherwise it's just kinda weird.  When it comes to story from what I gathered there's a zombie virus that makes girls have secks with you to "heal" themselves or whatever, but to be fair I just skipped 90% of the dialogue.  And I finished all of the content this game has to offer within 2.3 hours.   To summarize this, as fun as it might seem at first I'm fairly certain that most players will find the content of this game to be simply quite boring. I struggle to really picture the target demographic for this title too; it's for people that like to read a lot, like to shoot guns, like to "work" for secks, and also fantasize about having secks with undead and giant worms. On top of that, they must be oblivious to the existence of porn online, since I can imagine that you could easily find much better quality content on there, for free.
As a joke game, in all honesty I would have said this was alright. Like an anime boob game meets left for dead or killing floor... but it said no where in the description that there was rape as the zombies are all trying to rape your party, not like the expected eat, and will grab your party members and start violating them and you have to shoot them off... I don't like that personally and I'll have to give it a thumbs down since they don't state it anywhere on the store page. Honestly otherwise for like a shameless boob game (I love senran kagura so believe me i can appreciate a good one) it was fine and I feel like I would have had fun with it but, for me personally, this game was too far with that aspect.
Yep.... 2D Look Good. [I like it too] BUT 3D Look NOT SO Good.  Well...That a refund for me. 
Game is censored and dev doesn't seem to plan on releasing the full version.   Refunded.
TL;DR, Shitty zombie shooter but with hentai.   Do not read believe any of the positive reviews claiming this to be like "Left 4 Dead" or "Killing floor" because that couldnt be further from the truth. Unlike this game, L4D and KF actually have responsive guns and fun gameplay. This game on the other hand is just your typical poorly zombie shooter but with sex and barbie doll waifus plastered all over it. The gameplay can't even manage to be more fun than any other free browser games. I wouldn't even keep playing this game if I got it for free. This is a warning to anyone who sees the positive reviews; [h1] DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME [/h1]
This game Is not good It is very shallow even with some of the more preverse games out there at least there is some sort of knowing what or when the next part of the game will end it is not trying to hide what it is but it does not do what it is meant to do well very mediocre would not recommend to anyone
Characters look like melting barbie dolls with nipples drawn on. Gunplay is passable. Kind of feels like a mobile first person shooter ported to PC. Not for the faint of heart the original title for this game was called "Rape of the Dead" and by golly does it live up to that name. the sprite models are well made but the 3D ones can only be laughed at. I cant imagine this game tittilating anyone but as a joke game its a unique experience. consider buying multiplle copies and sending them to your overly sensitive steam friends as christmas presents
It is very bad. For the most part it seems to be an asset flip, the only added thing above the very mediocre shooter mechanics are the sex minigame, though it is super basic(just basic timing).  The sex scenes aren't much better, whatever appeal there might have been is pretty much ruined by the ugly models. If you want to fap, there is alot of better material online that you could use. The story is very basic, the typical zombie story but with no depth(due to the low length of the actual game and the quality of the writing).  Personally, this does proof that sex indeed sells somewhat because if it wasnt for that, nobody would care about this game and call it what it is, an asset flip. I think that you can make good games with sexual content AND gameplay but this isnt a good example of it since it does neither of it very well.
At least it's better than Wolfenstein II.
[b]Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead and Silent Hill had an Anime baby. Plus you have sex with girls. Too bad the shooting feels like hot farts.[/b]  Full video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chLIbekqaLk
Decent game with good "Material" ruined by mosaics. Wait on buying this until the devs release a patch. If they won't I suggest staying away from this one.
Seriously - this is absolute rubbish.
sick game  - animation poor  - model make me cry
there was a uncensored patreon patch, pls add it!
Not worth 10$ 
The hitboxes could use some work and the gun spray really goes wild with all the automatics. Also my dick could be bigger.
Rather than calling it "The Eternal Arena", I would call it "The Failed Arena".  This is definitely not what I had in mind.
Updated review after playing for 30 hours. MASSIVE GAMEPLAY SPOILERS ahead! If you want to figure out the game for yourself, go to TL;DR at the bottom!  Let me start by saying that I still think this is a great game. Then lets establish some basic facts:  1. A standard turn has an allowance of 2 action points, unspent ones convert into Fate. 2. The Noble gives +1AP/turn for 12 Influence, with a 10% chance to end unless a further 12 Influence is spent on The Inquisitor. 3. A certain rare item and a certain starting operative give +2 free moves permanently, while a certain common item gives +2 free moves for one turn only. As the name inplies, these moves may only be spent on move actions (duh).  Having established this, lets get on with it:  MY PERSONAL JOURNEY  Having unlocked all stories, starting operatives and cults, I was very much looking forward to playing the game casually by experimenting with different combinations of the aforementioned parameters. After playing a few games, it quickly dawned on me how much I had relied on "cheesy" tactics to beat the game. Having the right starting operative for the job, and having prior knowledge of the cult and story decks, is a massive part of beating the game - perhaps too massive.  WORKER PLACEMENT  A big part of this game is making sure your operatives are standing where they can utilize their skills to harvest resources. To facilitate this, most operatives are recruited in locations where their skills are common in the corresponding adventure deck. In addition, scattered around the map are recruitable Townfolk that allow you to fast-travel to a preset location by spending an action point. When events conspire against you howerever, making a critical relocation can take the entirety of 1, 2 or even 3 turns.  THE AP SINKS  Your first starting operative, Virian Spellbinder, has the ability Contemplation of the Arcane that allows him or any other operative to spend 1 Lore and 1 AP to reduce corruption by 10. The game tells you that this, together with his tranquility, allows him to cast spells more often. This is simply not true. Contemplation of the Arcane has not been used by me a single time so far. By the time loosing 10 corruption seems like a good use for an action point, the game has almost certainly already been lost in all but name.  I could lengthen this already over-long review immensly by bringing up multiple examples of items, spells, and townfolk who fall into the same category, but my overarching point here is that there is a lot of content in this game that simply cannot compete for an action point. Especially because of...  CULTIST MOVEMENT AND THE TICKING CLOCK  Cultist spawn and cultist movement are governed by the story and cult decks. When a cultist movement card is drawn, all cultists get to move simultaneously. This is often a blessing in disguise however, as they will often leave their shrines and so reduce the rate of cult activity buildup. Cultists and cult shrines, like operatives, will continually effect the location they are in, spreading influence, increasing the rate of cult activity and threatening operatives with health damage and cult-specific debuffs. While cultist hunting is often a solid strat, the cult activity will always increase at a minimum of 1 per turn. Every time the meter fills completely the cult deck is replaced with a more powerful one, significantly reducing your chance to complete the main quest. Overinvesting AP into cultist hunting at the expense of pursuing the chapter objective is the bane of many runs.  THE STRENGTH OF RUSH STRATEGIES  Picking the operatives that can complete the Chapter objectives by spending the least amount of action points, wether through resource generation, free moves, or sheer iron dice power has so far proved to be the most effective strategy against all opponents. Each AP spent on cultist hunting is very often an AP that did not get spent towards the current Chapter objective. More importantly, cultist hunting only delays the failure state of the game, it does not prevent it. Working towards the final chapter goal is the only way to prevent the failure state, resulting in a victory. Having one socially skilled operative camping the Cathedral District while another hunts for cultist cloaks is a powerful strat but has a set-up time of several AP while leaving the cathedral camper exposed.  THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND THE DIFFICULTY OF COMEBACKS  This is the big one right here. At the end of the day, this is a game where a lot of dice are being rolled. A common game theory tells us that any increase in randomness favors the underdog. Other game mechanics conspire against this principle however. A status ailment being inflicted on a key operative, wether Exhausted, Mark of the Beast, or Cursed, will lessen your ability to complete further challanges, in turn suffering additional penalties. While your operatives are frantically spending precious AP trying to recover from this downward spiral, the Cultus Arcanum does not suffer from randomness: they steadily increase cult influence and activity each turn until a critical mass is achieved.  CONCLUSION  While I've had a great time playing this game and look forward to any upcoming dlc, I must confess I am a little disappointed in the lack of potential for casual play. Trying out suboptimal builds and getting stuck in a downward spiral where each turn lessens your chance of victory is simply not fun. Ideally, after a major setback it should be a dramatic and desperate race against time to beat the Cultus Arcanum on the finish line. The tightness of the AP economy sucks the probability and tension out of that scenario and make you feel like you are wasting your time.  I applaud the devs for their vision and bravery in designing a game like this to have a baseline of only 2 global action points per turn. But as I've explained at length now in this overly-long tirade, I do feel that a lot of potential gameplay falls by the wayside simply because of how massively precious AP is as a resource.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR  The core game mechanic just doesn't work. I would still recommend this game to any fan of digital board games, especially those that enjoy a rouge-like challange of trial and error and figuring out optimal strategies. Just be aware that the returns drop noticably after unlocking everything. If you are a glutton for punishment however, trying to complete stories with suboptimal starting operatives will greatly increase the lifespan of this game for you.
[b]tl;dr:[/b] Do not play games that do not respect your time.  Honestly, it seems great at first, but the longer you play, the less thought out the whole experience seems. It starts as you unlock new "threats". One of the first, the Gates, is basically unbeatable without extreme luck. At its end, it has you fight a Cosmic Horror, which has about 60 combat to begin with, and each 1 you roll gives it an additional +5. So not only do you have to roll 60 with only three tries, but every 1 you roll increases the amount you need. As a comparison, normal enemies have 15-30 combat, but allow you the same amount of tries. How many dice you can roll is determined by your abilities. Your standard abilities let you roll 1 die... So forget about them. You get new abilities (and become stronger) only by going to places and hoping that an event fires which will give you a new item/ability/whatever. All of which is fully random - or if it isn't, lacks any explanation. That's right, there is not a single reliable, repeatable way of gaining spells/abilities/etc. in the game. You'd expect stores or teachers, but... nope. The only repeatable actions are increased income of the various resources and conversion of these resources between one another.  What this all leads to is that you send your operatives around in the vague hopes of collecting enough items and abilities to beat the boss. All while the global threat level rises - which is supposed to be threatening, but barely matters - until you lose when it reaches max. In other words, 90% luck, 10% skill is required in order to actually beat the game. If you get lucky and get all the right buffs on one character, easy game. If you don't, impossible game.  Add to that that you only can do two things per turn (independent of the number of operatives you have, wtf). This can be increased by 1 at a certain location, but really should be dependent on your number of operatives, each of them should have two-three actions.  The only viable "strategy" is to get as many operatives as possible and have them in as many locations as possible, to maximize your "event harvesting" and knowing which operatives should be where (it never changes, so once you know it, you're good). So what you do every single time is to first get 3AP per turn, then maximize the number of operatives, spread them and do the "quests" and pray to the RNG gods that this somehow results in one of your operatives being strong enough to face the boss. Of course, you cannot fight with multiple operatives, even if they are at the same place. That would have made too much sense...  In addition to that, the UI and gameplay flow is just bad. Why by all that is holy are there still developers out there who do not bind "end turn" to Enter, Space, etc. AND have non-rebindable keys? I want to slap every single developer who puts out games without rebindable keys. Why do you have to wait for animations to finish in a BOARD GAME?! No, I'm not kidding. Why do you get a popup telling you about a location when you visit it for the first time IN EACH GAME? The map is static. That's like showing a tutorial every time you play.  Honestly, if you want to play a board game on your PC that respects your time, play one of the many others that are actually thought out well and offer a UI experience that won't make you bang your head against the keyboard.
Massive potential here.  As noted by others, lack of a manual is deadly.  Why, for example, are operatives red and unrecruitable?  This seems a pretty important resource for the game to leave unexplained.   Now, some have called for a tutorial but for my vote, the gaming crowd for this kind of game would prefer an actual manual which is much easier to do than a good tutorial which is actually quite hard.  Or, at minimum, keep working on more useful tooltips.  On a very practical note, the game opens in a very confusing way.  It took me forever, for example, to figure out where my action counter was.  The shame here is the number of people that might get lost instantly.  The encouragement from the developers to "explore" is a bad cop out for a poor starting experience.  Hoping to give this a thumbs up down the road.  I want to explore this game once the core mechanics become more transparent.  Let's face it... this is a flavourful board game.  We need to know the rules.
Had to refund it as the game is bugged and for sure incomplete! I was that upbeat for the game I had even joined their discord group which had nobody bar the developers which was a clear red flag! The Game didn’t register my left hand. Developer said I needed to remove the 3rd and 4th cameras but still the same issue. It looks nice but the single player is a wave shooter and with 1 hand obviously it’s terrible. It jumps from wave to wave erratically too. Multiplayer on the trailer looks awesome but couldn’t find a match after multiple tries. A lot of fixes need for this, so I had to get a refund. Seems like they invested a lot with the marketing and actors and my feeling is that they ran out of funds as the game has been released before the scheduled 2019 date and it still needs a lot of work. I’d say for everyone to wait until there are significant updates and improvements before buying. I will keep my eye out as it has potential to be great...but as it stands it’s just a big disappointment
$6 for a game manual? I get that the bundle discount of $12 essentially negates the price, but this manual should be free for everyone, not locked away to artificially increase the price of the digital deluxe edition.
So, issues with the game, it's made by a french bloke, that's enough isn't it? :P  Seriously though; There's no english audio and the subtitles flash by a bit too fast occasionallly, which wouldn't be a major issue if it wasn't for: The translation is not up to par, it's going for a bit more academic language which just looks horrible when not translated correctly - this is an exact quote from the game; "The surgical repair of your brain injuries is still fresh".  The mechanic of grabbing and dropping the box leaves some to be desired as grabbing may not work, if you move too fast you may drop it, having it roll over when it shouldn't, all of this has nothing to do with puzzles, the puzzle should be the problem and not if the game decides that the box should roll into the water even if it is square...  Options are odd as well to say the least - with that said, you are allowed to rebind keys for mouse+KBD as well as controller, big thumbs up for that - "Gamepad face button bottom" is what's usually (on the Xbox controller) referred to as "A"...  I do believe there might be a nice story and maybe even a good game hiding behind obstacles such as me not speaking French, I won't refund it as I do believe it is a work of love - and unlike Identity RPG I could actually check the settings without crashing the game :O - but I can't recommend it to anyone that doesn't speak French...
This game is really nothing else, but frustrating. The art is nice, however it's not nearly enough compensation for the trouble you go through. It's exaggeratedly difficult, especially when you're approaching the final levels.  In more detail, it's buggy - sometimes I literally died from nothing when the level just started and you can also pop entire big bubbles on the top if your shot was precise and well-timed. If you lose all your health points, the game goes back to the main menu and you have to start the level from the beginning, although it's probably one of the most irritating things in the world. It's just a total waste of time.  When you're in the gallery (because of course you wanna see the "prizes" you get from completing the levels), you can only select one picture at a time. So when you want to check out the next one, you seriously have to press Esc key every single time to go back and choose another picture...  This game's not worth it. These little problems may not be so bad, but Gothicc Breaker is a much better choice in my opinion.
Terrible game. Bought for a joke and usually love meme games but this one is just bad
fuck you
Just out of curiousity, mainly because there is no trailer and i like to try new things, i bought this game. It is right now nothing more then a small sandbox with three tiny maps (but one is not working because you start under the map) where you can beat and shoot enemies. It is all very barebone, the enemies looks all the same, the main map is empty with a few huts and you can fly a bit in a helicopter. I do not know, in which way the dev want to go, but right now, it is not fun. The whole game is in chinese, but you can play it without knowing the language. There are lots of buttons in the main screen which do nothing, maybe the dev adds cool stuff in the future. Until then, i can not recommend the game, but i will come back, when there is more to do.  Gameplay-footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjoJJ5XOEdA 
Played for about ten minutes. Most of which was scrolling through page after page of fairly pointless text. I am guessing the point of the game is to gradually conquer the entire map one province at a time. The final straw is the combat system.  Am army of puppies that you need to micromanage....  I can't see the games appeal and have requested a refund.   
Terrible game.  Really terrible.  If my kid hadn't purchased this a while ago I'd be refunding.  Stay away.  I couldn't even follow the tutorial to a point where I created my first sword - unsure whether this is because of the crazy controls, a bug or because I've just missed something.
Alright, as most reviews have said, this is very much proclaiming that I can't recommend the game in its current state.  I understand that it's early access and that bugs are going to happen, but the number of bugs and glitches feel very disproportionate to the appearance of the game in my opinion. It actually looks pretty good, and I freely admit that the gameplay is actually really damn fun; I'm going to keep playing the hell out of it because it's a blast to design and make swords.  That said, this game needs polish in the mechanics instead of in the beauty that it seems to have gotten; it's a really pretty game that doesn't work very well. Just tonight, I've had the already mentioned issues of not being able to pick up parts, getting locked into screens, and earlier I lost a really damn expensive sword that I was proud of because it just blinked out of existence when I tried to cast magic on it for a customer. I tried reloading to see if it would magically (pun intended) come back, but it didn't; not only did the sword remain vanished, I lost all of my supplies in the forge room as well. It's just not very playable for the cost in its current state.  Now I'm really confident that it'll get the polish and fleshing out that it needs, and it's going to be a really good game when it does. I'm legit excited to see it finished. But I cannot recommend anybody pay money for it and try to seriously play it as it stands. Developers, please fix the mechanics before you do anything else to the aesthetics.
I played for 7 hrs I like whats happening in this game but I can not recommend it at this point. Crashes way to often no save function that I can find other than exiting game and coming back.  Customers will come to the door asking for you to do a thing you say yes and get locked in a screen. I have resorted to just auto selling swords and ignoring customers all together   I like this game but it has to get better before I can shill it to my friends
This is like someone's Ludum Dare project. Idea is there, but almost impossible to enjoy.
While this game is a work in progress at this time i cant recommend it.   It is just chocked full of bugs, like losing your billet cause it fell through the forge.   Also the screen shots show nice looking swords with fullers and sharp edges.  Yeah... ingame not so much, no fullering, no nice sharp looking swords just things in the rough shape of a sword.  I will say the Damascus looks nice and well done, but it still lost when you realize its on something that looks like a nerf sword made of roughed out metal.    Also if I run the game on full anti lasing for to long it blue screen crashes my PC, havent had a blue screen crash in like 10 years..... so thats impressive in a way.   Also when someone comes to your forge to buy, a whoooooooole lot of them have requirements for things that arent even possible in the current build.  Like I want a Silver sword with a beautiful handle that costs over 200. Sure ok, cept there are no beautiful handles ingame, and there is no sword handle part that costs over 25 let alone 200.  This makes the game seriously frustrating to play because you have a wall of swords but cant sell them unless you want to do the instant sale option and lose -20% of the value every time.  Game has potential but it should not have been sold yet, even as early access.  Early access means the game is 95% complete, this feels more like 60%.  Its a good 60% but 1/2 a game is still 1/2 a game.
The game is great in serenity and though it has its bugs there is just too much wrong with it even though it is in Early Access. 20% of the time you are actually making swords and the other 80% of the time is waiting to sell 1 sword at a time. You have 8 slots to sell weapons yet you only have enough coins to make 1 at a time. If you like watching paint dry.. good game. I can't even play it at the moment since there is nothing to do in the game. Don't get this game till it is fully polished. Go see a movie for 8 bucks. Its better 2 hours of your time.
My initial thoughts after 10 hours played.  This game is to early to be released as "early access".  Seeing old discussions with issues from beta stage that still isnt fixed going into EA, leads me to believe they desperate need money to their team.   Game was released on march 8:th, first update relased march 9:th and second update on march 13:th.  Now we're at march 18:th and no update or fixes on urgent issues is here.  From my experience from other EA games it is not unusual to recieve more than one update/day in the initial stage of releasing an EA game. As a matter of fact it is very unusual to NOT recieve frequently updates (1/day or every second day) the first couple of weeks after an EA release.   Cool game with potential, but way to soon to be released as an EA. Should still need time in beta imo. Would not recommend buying this game in the stage it is.
At the moment, game is unplayable.Way to many bugs and game crashes. Will try and get my money back and then wait about 6 months. So in its current state NOT recommended.
It needs more fixing on the anvil and forging the ingots. There are lots of impurities after forging the ingot into the shape of the design of the sword.
I really wanted to give this game a positive review, because as a concept its brilliant, but i cant, because its just too buggy, the amount of times i have had to Alt F4 for the game (Mainly in the constructing the sword screen) i have lost count.... The developer needs to listen to the community to sort out the issues, so it can be a more enjoyable experience..... I accidentally dropped my tongs in the cooling barrel, and thats it, you cant get them back, i had to buy new ones..... The people turning up for swords are asking for damascus steel ones (i have only just started....so i am no where near that stage yet), so it makes selling your Bronze swords difficult, as no one wants them, therefore you dont make any money and cant upgrade your blacksmith shop to make iron swords etc, i appreciate this part is perhaps very RnG, but could do with looking at.... Some of the spelling isn't brilliant.... but its a minor thing, i get that the developer isn't native to English speaking. Once the bugs are resolved and its more playable i will change my review to positive, but i cannot honestly recommend the game in its current state.
blacksmithing simulator turned waiting game ... wherever have u seen a blacksmith working on the fly? that's a weapon store ... a bs work on WORK ORDERS. learn it.  also ... why in the hell would u put an elevator in a forge if u'r never sending anything up? have u ever heard of a shoot?   i am terribly mad at this game! it could be the best thing for me yet ... but it really ain't worth it yet!
Woo. I really wanted to like this. It's a game type I love and I was excited by the idea of it. But it's just not there yet. I'm not saying it WON'T be there. I think it will. It just needs more time. I refunded it but will try it again in the future, no doubt, as long as the devs keep working on it.  My major complaints right now: I repeatedly ran into a bug where my hammer would suddenly get stuck in front of me, out of my hand, and I'd be flying backwards and up. No kidding. It happened several times.   Tool swapping is honestly a pain. You should hold the tongs in left hand and hammer in right, and it should just be a thing where you hit a button and pull them out, hit another button to pull out your thermometer, etc. Having to stumble around for my tools on the floor all over the place was frustrating and frantic. And with the game's poor hitbox detection (what a thing to have to say about a game about forging swords) I couldn't reliably grab a pair of tongs and put my ingot on the anvil again before it was too cold to hammer.   The therm would actually be better just built onto the forge itself. Having to try to point it at the tiny sliver of sword in the forge seems silly. Or just make the glowing color system more readable and forget the tool. It doesn't work too well as is.  I despised the minigames. Trying to click right when it hits the right area for handling was... really dumb. It goes so fast I can't even gauge it. It's completely luck. Please give a better system for grinding and handling than really simplistic and stupid, totally immersion breaking minigames?  So reason I quit: I ordered parts and when they got in, I put the handle together on the handling table, then went to forge the blade. When I got the thing ready, all the parts had vanished from the table. Sigh. So I went to order more handle parts... can't. You have to make a whole new sword to order more parts. What?? Neither of these things should have happened.  Also, you start with so little money, ONE messed up sword means you don't have enough money to get more. So there should be some odd jobs. Fix horseshoes, mend swords and stuff. Make pots. Idk. Smithy stuff.  Use that to make some money back to go on making new swords.  I want to love this game. I hope the devs will make it lovable in the future. For now, I can't recommend it because it's just... not finished enough to even really be more than an alpha demo.   Good luck devs.
I play a lot of EA games but this is the buggies one of all. I think it will be a very good game eventually but not right now. Unless you just want to help the Dev. make this game I would say wait. It is still fun, but frustrating. I'm giving it a negative review because I don't think the average player will be very happy with it the way it is. I hope to change this review soon
Good concept, bad implementation. On its current state I don’t recommend this game, it still needs polish. The controls feel buggy. The tools are easily lost. The tutorial isn’t great to get started. The best thing is to give some time to developers to fix current problems and then give it try.
While this game is still in early access, there are A LOT of bugs that really put a damper on the experience. Primarily, there is a lot of erroneous hit detection which sends objects flying in random directions resulting in you needing to return them to a proper place for the first process. Having to switch between tongs and hammer manually is rather slow and cumbersome, which allows the metal to cool too quickly before you can really begin to work the metal properly, which means another trip back to the smelter so drop the hammer, pick up the tongs, drop the ingot in, find the thermometer and try to the find the spot where the thermometer picks up the temperature, which typically is no where near the ingot. Frankly, I would prefer either a mouse wheel rotation, or a button press to switch between hammer and tongs so those precious seconds aren't lost between forgings. Also, attaching the thermometer to the forge itself and using a method of color on the ingot to determine whether or not it is ready i think would be a much smoother process in the long run.  All in all, the game really captures the concepts of forging quite well, but I think right now it is just missing the mark on transitioning comfortably between tools and awkward hit detection. Should shape up to be a solid game in the very near future.
Critical bug or mal-mechanism found, The anvil is useless, simply bring the hot ingot close to the hammerhead in, like, anywhere, and wasd around a little bit. Keep 'rubbing' the ingot against the hammerhead and the blade would then be forged insanely quick. NO ANVIL IS REQUIRED ACTUALLY.  I had a very high expectation for this game. But now it seems that a hell lot of work needs to be implemented.
Ive seen worse with some polish i can see myself spending some hours into this game. How ever there are a few bugs Like when you try to put away your hammer and it becomes sentient and pens you to the ceiling. and the fact that most of the game is waiting for people to buy your stuff. if they buy your stuff. I can't recommend the game as it is now maybe later after some work.
want a refund
Bugs for days. Tutorial is not good.
This game does not deserve to be sold yet. this is good and well in its infant stages of beta. Don't waste money on it yet.
It's a good concept for a game but it's just too buggy to be enjoyable at the moment.  Lost my tongs in the water barrel, tried to put my hammer back and ended up floating around. Lost my crossguard in the tutorial.  I know the devs want to add new features but in my opinion they need to polish the current game state rather than making a bloated buggy mess.  tldr - don't buy now, wait and see what happens.
First of all i must say, I'm not going to refund this game since there is quite the potential for a really good game here. You have to plan the sword beforehand and have to purchase the materials. Then you just make the sword. Simple but an idea that can be quite interesting and fun.  But since it is only early access there are quite a few bugs. Tools vanish at random and the controls feel very unpolished and clunky but ive seen much worse.  I would not say you should buy this game at its current state, BUT if you think that this game has potential you maybe could buy it and give the developers the little money this game costs to help the developer polish the controls and fix the bugs. I certainly will follow this game and hope it becomes a nice little indie game that people can enjoy.
Very buggy, not ready for early access.  The physics and collision detection are not working properly, your character and stuff will fly all over and get stuck on things. Most of the time you have to click multiple times to pick something up. The hammer will constantly get stuck in a state where you can't reach it and have to reset the game. I don't think the assembly of the sword works at all?  Update 2019-03-18: With the latest update, the hammer and the tongs are gone so you literally can't play the game.
I know it's in early acces, but at this stage the game is pretty unplayable. Maybe in a couple months I'll give this another shot but for now it's getting removed from my library.
nice concept at all but too many bugs that cause the bad game experience. tutorial is to simple, not able to guide player how to play this game  since it's in early access...wish it will be better
This game could be good but it is SOOO early, it needs music, it needs lights cuz it's so dark, if you drop something, good luck to find it. The concept is good but wouldnt buy.
Tested out this game, i think the concept idea for the game could lead to a fun game in the longrun. Graphics are simple and ok! The biggest cons as of release day is bugs, and the devs need to add some more guidelines as to how to progress. Bugs: The bug i encountered thus far is a bug in movement, you suddenly out of nowhere start to glitch around the forge, and loose all control of movement.. This needs to be patched before the game is playable. Can't recommend it as of now, but it can become fun.
...terrible interactive design. I even cannot press "exit" on the initial interface with that bloody hand.
Couldn't play this for more than 10 minutes tbh. ...Let's go over the pros first tho:  - Graphics - They are amazing in this tbh. - OST - Really chill imo, but that always seems to be the case with games that have tranquil graphics like this.  And that's it if I'm being honest, not to be an ass.   Cons:  - The texting system - Really slow, a bit complicated, and just all around unecessary imo. This put me off a ton. - No voice acting, even though the trailer had some. - A LOT of dialogue to flick through, which can get boring. - Bugs - For example, I could scroll through dialogue in the intro whilst having the game pause, but with silence. Why? - Lack of sense of direction - After the intro it just feels like you're all over the place tbh (might be just me, but still).  The potential for this game is there, definitely. As it stands right now though, not for me. Sorry.
Full of bugs, pretentious dialogue, characters and plot, the bugs can cause you to start a new game. It's also really boring. Like, spectacurarly dreadful. You have to wait to do everything and everything by itself in this game is monotonous and expectable, also "deep" and "philosophical". Did I mention there are a lot of bugs? "Early access" doesn't mean it's nearly unplayble, it means it's an early build that is supposed convince the public. Not this thing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWf_bOkgNXw
not even worth a single dollar.
So, I've played quite a few of the games published by Kagura Games, but this one seriously falls short of their typical level of quality. The combat is bland, the H-scenes are more cringy than arousing, but the dialogue of the main character is easily the worst part, with his (your) dialogue being almost entirely cringe, with him stuttering like a mentally disabled person every time he thinks of doing or saying something pervy to one of the many female characters and aggressively questioning them with multiple annoying rapid fire questions followed by three "hmms?!" Seriously, that, and the strange control scheme they went with, make this more of an embarrassment to play than the fact that it's a H-game.
Soooooooooooo Boring Game // เกมโคตรน่าเบื่อเลยเสียดายเงินที่จ่ายมาก
Not much time on the game, but I don't like it. With this title Kagura seems to be going to the way of the Sakura and Neko Para games, and away from serious H-games. The mechanics of the game remind me of ancient early rpgs from the 1980s, way to outdated to be fun. The positive reviews confuse me, because this is not the kind of game I would want more of. I would like it if Kagura would give us more details on what to expect from the game, because I really wasn't interested in a light hearted tail of harem lust. I don't like playing the fool or having no direction in what happens to my heroes and heroines.
Unfortunately I'm going to have to down vote this game. I really wanted to play the game but right when I load it up i get black lines all over the place and cant do anything without seeing them everywhere. Trying to play it on windows headset so I'm not sure if that's why. I had a similar bug one other time on richie's plank experience and was not able to fix it. Will have to refund if I can't find a solution.
Terrible and nothing seems to work right. Multiplayer was non existant.
It's very boring, at first I had trouble because I couldn't change the position. However, once I fixed that problem the game wasn't very fun as I hoped it would be. : ( It might be little more fun if you played with someone else?
I really, really want to love this game. I'm a huge fan of Cooking Fever and was siked to play something similar with a friend in VR. Unfortunately, the videos do not set realistic expectations and performance issues plague this game.    Multiplayer is the core reason I purchased this game, but with a single game mode and fairly simplistic gameplay, there's not much here to keep you coming back more than one or two rounds. We also experienced really terrible frame rate drops the longer we were in the multiplayer experience. This gradual loss in performance gets to a point where the game is sickening. Support in their Discord channel was non-existent for this issue (for a month now). Don't expect to successfully throw (or block, for that matter) objects as shown in the video. Aside from hitting your A.I. server in the face with objects (which is brilliant), you've got a 1 in 100 chance to throw something and hit your buddy.   Single player features 30 missions (IIRC) that slowly increase in difficulty. Unfortunately, with performance issues and some clunky control mechanics, this just becomes frustrating to play after a while. Getting items off of a plate or layering them differently is maddening. Liquid physics for the drinks just seem broken and pouring fries into the fryer is just...unrealistic. There are also very obvious bugs like condiments not applying correctly when the plate is placed on the left side of the table.    Making all of this worse is the slow rate of updates coming from the small development team. Announced in the general chat in the Discord, the devs mentioned they're upgrading to a newer version of Unity, working on two new single player game modes, and rebuilding their menu design. Sadly, the core game mechanics need some desperate attention before I would even consider touching anything else.    All that said, no refund for me...I'm along for the ride and will hope the devs deliver. Just don't expect much if you decide to drop $20 on this unfinished game.
Very broken refunded instantly
The game looked like allot of fun. but sadly its not. the mechanics in the game is beyond awful items no colides and its no freedom on cutting things you have to cut the food by an guidence line. And it stutters even when you take too many burgers out (like 6 of them) jezz what a garbage game. the screenshots look nothing like the game, ingame grapichs looks like garbage just no
Poor gameplay. Looks and feels like 1990's Jill of the Jungle with a sprite overhaul. Very bizarre aesthetic. Haven't even figured out the premise of the story. If it was already presented, I lost it in the sea of poorly-written dialog.
You can call this a first impressions review if you'd like, as I've only played about 18 mins.  I want to like this, but I just can't.   The story is muddled for one. I started up the game and the woman starts talking like I walked in during the middle of a conversation. Why is she talking to herself? Who the fuck is she talking about? I've never heard of those people yet. Who the fuck is she talking to?  While I like the art/spritework on the main character and a lot of the enemies, the work on the environments is just plain horrible. For instance, I'll be walking and am able to walk behind a pillar. Later in the room I'll encounter another that for some reason I can't walk through. Like it looks the same but is somehow now in the foreground.  *shakes head*  The game also isn't very clear where you should go. For example, there's a room that's basically only a bunch of green boxes you jump on. When you jump on them, they fall (not to mention the controls are not as tight as they should be for a platformer... with an XBone controller at least.) So I'm jumping around these boxes and constantly get to the same place in the room where I get stuck, so if I'm doing something wrong, I have no idea, because the game doesn't lead you or give you any indication in any way. This just causes repeat failures and frustration.  I've played much better games in the same price range. This game seems like it was a student project where they just kinda said, "fuck it" and sold it without putting in a lot of effort into it's design.  I'm not going to return it, because to be honest, I paid less for it than I did the beer in my hand. While the beer in my hand is much better than this game, at least I get a little Steam level XP for having it in my library. For anyone looking for a solid platformer though, I recommend looking elsewhere.
I beat 3 bosses so far. They are pretty hard but reasonable. But the platforming is torturingly hard. I quit the game after dying too many times in the same level, and I think I am just at the beginning of the game too.
Store page states full controller support. I guess not.
My disappointment with this title is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.  I was expecting to be able to stream this game, however, I was unable to do so. The only thing that appeared on stream was a black screen. Nothing could save me, or my experience. Not even changing the broadcast settings to "capture all video from this machine" managed to fix it.   I will gladly change my review once this issue is fixed, so far though, I am forced to give it a negative review.
It's a good idea but the artwork is terrible.

PSA: THIS GAME IS A SCAM! They purchased a pre-made template from the Unity Asset store and changed nothing, not even the name, and are now selling it. They've also been stealing games from the RPGMaker forums (that are free) and are selling them.  PROOF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3wfh9J2MQA
absolutely shit
Sorry to report, but it has been brought to my attention that Sky Flight (and possibly many more by this developer) are very likely not legitimately produced games, but rather, asset flips. I'm refunding.  https://rpgmaker.net/forums/topics/24256/  Thank you, and sincere regrets if I mislead anyone.
Nanoswarm Watch my video: https://youtu.be/mCJZ1cZ1vfI  Art Style: The art direction of this game is simple yet pleasing to the eye for the type of game Nanoswarm is.  Story: As for a story and lore to the game, there is little to none. The game is basically just round after round of gauntlet for you and your tank against other nanobots.  Gameplay: For me, the gameplay was not fun. The controls don't feel the best and within seconds you are over run with ten or fifteen other bots. I think the game would be more fun if there was more "strategic" fighting rather than RUN FOR YOUR LIFE AND SHOOT!!!!  Difficulty: The game is more difficult than it should be. Yes, I am not good at the game but it is also very hard to survive past a few minutes in a level.  Worth the Price of $4.99: No 
Is this some kid's school project? If so, keep the $0.49
Can't believe I had to refund a $0.49 game. I wouldn't even waste time writing a review but there are no english reviews at this time. They're trying to pawn this off as a $5 game and it shows the blatant lack of knowledge and true intent of the developer. This thing is more of a proof of concept than anything else.   Don't be fooled by its description, "The Gameshow" is a single player battle-royale NPC hunt that will lead you around a barren map for an hour trying to hunt down the last 4 enemies.   There is no collapsing storm wall to focus enemies into a tighter area, which makes you hunt around endlessly, listening for gunshots until there are so few enemies that they can't even find each other. Seriously, I was going to attempt to win a game but noticed they don't even give you an achievement for your wasted effort. Guns are totally unresponsive with no visual hit indicators for yourself or enemies. Inventory management is simply "drop", with no ability to stack or move items (not that there are even enough variety of items to warrant an inventory system). The map doesn't even show POI's so you will continually run around wondering if you've seen everything or not. Development appears dead in the water, so don't even bother.  This concept could be a fun little time killer if they reduced the map size 50%, reduced the NPC count 50%, reduced the price 90% and added more POI's. However the gun play and AI would require massive improvements which is probably too much to ask for.
dont buy its Fairy Tale Adventure with a lot less content
Felt incomplete and rushed, some sections were poorly thought out and didn't make sense. About the quality of an old newgrounds flash game. Art was good but inconsistent (especially the backgrounds). Story was all over the place and hardly coherent.
Not for me personally. Rather boring but again, that is my opinion.
fsdfsdf
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA TAG UP FOR SEXUAL CONTENT? REALLY?
can't play WHY ????
I'll be honest, I only got the DLC when half off simply for the music and the unit skins.   The "features" are not worth anything: the expanded mission trees should be a free feature since they are a core game mechanic, the flagship is flavor but that's all, the naval bombardment you'll never use and kicking out minorities is only fun for roleplaying but since it's limited to a handful of nations, it's worthless.
Summed up in 1 song: Do what you want, 'cause a pirate lives free,  YOU ARE A PIRATE!  Yar har, fiddle di dee,  Being a pirate is alright to be,  Do what you want 'cause a pirate lives free,  You are a pirate!
Sh.it
Lost my dutch campaign because spain has permanent claims on my land 6500 kilometers away in the netherlands for no discernible reason and went to war for it. If they didn't get the burgundian inheritance why the hell should they have claims on the lowlands? Every immersion pack just gives more power to the countries that are already extremely powerful (Spain, Britain, Russia) god help us all when they released a french immersion pack that gives them free permanent claims on the entire HRE and italy.
Even though the immersion pack delivered the promise, it missed many opportunities. As an Iberian expansion, I would have rather seen more touch on colonization mechanics and how native Americans (mostly Totemists) function. Instead, we got pirates and ships.   Overall a DLC worth purchasing but it missed many opportunities and continued despite popular condemnation.
this dlc does not deserve its price
As far as immersion packs go, this one was really disappointing and that is sad because Rule Britannia was actually very good.   In this review I wish to compare the two, to explain why one failed and why one succeeded, not only sales wise but also community reception.  Rule Britannia had reworks that primarily focused on the British Isles but the mechanics also had a lot to say for the world at large, which made it a pick-up even if you did not play England or Scotland. These mechanics are as following:  The mission system, although free it reworked the mission system and made it much much better!  The naval doctrine allowed all nations to specialize their navy, a nice addition that effected everyone  Coal and the industrial revolution: This made late game more interesting for all nations, the introduction of coal affected all the parts of the world with the resource.  Knowledge sharing: It helped players spread knowledge specifically where they wanted to spread it, a nice addition to have.  Anglicanism: A whole new religion, however sadly it is lacking in some regards, especially in the fact that other christian nations cannot switch to it without being force converted which is a shame.  Innovativeness: This mechanic really wasn't that interesting and felt underwhelming, but it wasn't a negative, just a 'meh'.  Together with this were map updates to all the British Isles, low countries and France; which added more to countries that are very popular to play to begin with.  Now for what Golden Century brought:  Establish Orders: This could have been so much more, instead it is restricted to Iberians only and it is basically just a bonus laid onto your state provinces. It doesn't feel dynamic, and is rather static. It should have been a path for catholic nations to embrace religious orders for a price whilst iberians have them unlocked for free. A missed opportunity  Minority Expulsion: Throw minorities out of your country and send them to the new world, personally this is something i'd never use because I like to keep my colonies 1 culture and paint the map in whichever culture/language I play as, it feels very narrow in who would use it, and I do not see real point of it truth be told, nor the historical justification for it in an Iberian context. Maybe if it was to expel minorities at the cost of half your development in that province, and then there is a diceroll for what nation gets the refugees, depending on their culture group and religion + tolerance which gives them some free development, reflecting the alhambra decree and the forced conversion and fleeing of spanish moors.  New Mission Trees: These were okay, but nothing I actually expected to pay for truth be told.  Flagships: My personal highlight of the DLC, however again they are another missed opportunity by Paradox with plain oversight. Why isn't there a British culture group special flagship bonuses, and why isn't there flagship bonuses for other things; such as being commander of certain trade goods like naval equipment or special ones for pirate republics, or even better bonuses locked behind high naval tradition? And further; why can you only have 1? There should be ways to get more flagships but there isn't. It feels like a half finished addition HOWEVER the best addition to the immersion pack in my opinion.  Naval Barrage: Its listed as a feature, but it is just a little button and adds very little, its nice but not at all worth being called a 'feature'  The map updates are interesting but disappointing. Why did Cuba get so many more provinces but the Cayman Islands are still attached to Cuba instead of being its own province when it is so far away? And why is the island just south of cuba not its own province? It feels like the map changes weren't really thought out that well, but I am glad they fleshed out Mexico a little more and also Iberia did need a map update, just weird to see Galicia being split in 4 which again, makes me wonder if this lacked a clear vision.  In summary: The golden century DLC adds very little, and nothing 95% of players should pay full price for. EU4 is my favorite paradox game and one of my favorite games overall, I nearly quit during Dharma because the devs began to move the game in a direction I did not enjoy, but they have pulled back from this and found a nice middle ground. It is a shame they delivered such a lackluster immersion pack and actually think it is good enough to sell, when it needed much more work. Skip this one, unless it is on a big sale. Buy other DLC's instead, I am sure you can figure out which is worth it.
I got this at half price and still cannot recommend it but it might be worth it for you on sale.  If you are buying this for Unit packs & the Music price wise it’s not too bad, little expensive but the models are good (most you never see though) and the music is fun.  If you are like me and have crap attention to detail when looking at the models (sorry) and listen to podcasts when playing instead of the music and are looking to buy this for the game play improvements? Don’t.   The orders are a poorly developed 1 click mechanic limited to the Iberian nations for no other reason that this is an Iberian DLC.   Minority Expulsion is used just to net an achievement, otherwise largely pointless.  Pirate Republics not touched but it’s just a custom nation with a pirate flag  Naval Barrage never used in a Spanish campaign and I am in 1760. Says it all really  New missions –insert massive sigh- let’s take away a feature was not brilliant but mostly consistent for every county in the world. Now let’s replace it with DLC bait. Buy this DLC to have a huge advantage with these countries over the rest of them. Although I like the missions themselves (granted do limit creativity and some, Spanish and British’s are OP) these should be free and I cannot support them as paid DLC. You took away something and now make us pay to use the improved version!  In short not worth it for gameplay. If you like modals and music they are great but of the 20 new army units you will only ever see the Spanish ones unless you play as the other small nations. Never pay full price for this. 
I am so disgusted with Paradox lately, between "Imperator Rome and "DLC's" like this I almost hope they go out of business, they'd deserve it. Nothing but blatant corporate greed. Fucking DLC Vampires.
Honestly, I love EU4, and this adds a few cool things but overall its not really worth it unless you get it on sale
"mission pack" ...
Paradox business model is making dlc to fix issues that they mess up instead of patching it. Game costs over 200+ dollars now because of their business model making new players scarce and rare so they just pirate.
I bought this on sale for the price of an IPA.  The value is closer to a watered down beer.  Neither thumbs up nor thumbs down. Meh.  As an immersion pack for Spain / Portugal, GC let a lot of people down. Weak tea.   Personally, I bought it to play as pirates.  And, about 20 hours game time later, I'm kinda disappointed.  Pirates work as a modified Republic.  There's different flavor to the scripts, but the mechanics aren't much different.  The notable exception is that you are able to raid coasts, which turns out to be quite profitable.    Pirates are still cool -- just not as cool as I had hoped.  Other mechanics -- such as flagships or naval barrage -- don't warrant buying the DLC.  Placing those kind of global mechanics in thematic expansions is a poor move on Paradox's part, and creates enmity with consumers.  I'm a big supporter of Paradox's DLC development -- great DLC's keep their games fresh and evolving, and I'm happy to support them.  Many of the DLC's are worth the (sale) price.  Other DLC's, like this one, are jacked up.  Should be $5, not on sale.  Or, better yet, it should've included enough immersive content to justify the price.
:(
Compared to the other dlc this is incredibly lower level of content both quality and quantity.
One of the worst DLC as it didnt add much
I got it on a sale, you should to. For the amount of content it isn't worth the price. While I generally support Paradox's DLC system, this simply doesn't provide enough content to be worth $10.
trash
Bugs are out of hand, a waste of $10 for sure.
be gone non free updates
The Spanish Empire. The greatest superpower our species has ever seen, and probably will ever see until planetary unification. And yet Pubbydox can only come up with an immersion pack with less nuance, historical research and content than they put into some African or Asian minors.  Get it if it's on a huge discount. Not worth more than $2 or so. At best. Shame on you, Pubbydox.
locked missiontrees are pay2win i thought the trees from Great Britain DLC and from the Indian DLC were over the top, but from this one... just on another level. Portugal gets fucking provinces in india for free just for discovering it, just send your explorer to the indian ocean and BOOM you have Goa. No need to D-Day any majors like Bahmanis or Vijayanagar. The nutshell pirates are even worse: Get some stuff from subsaharan africans (like this is hard), build 10 regimental camps (only 2k ducats) and BOOM: You have 2,5% Discipline until the end of the game. Now you just have to NO CB Imeriti/Circassia, switch to orthodox and you will 1o1 any prussian/nepalese/mewari boi. You inherited the lowlands from burgundy,you enjoy the juciy income boost but in the back of your head there is a voice telling you: "Oh shit when its 1550 these swamp germans will riot even more then french revolutionaries. Should i move my capital to amsterdam? No, it costs to many adminpoints, so i cant core shit... Change culture? What a waste, i need the diplo points for peace deals and to kick start institutions... Seems like i have to station my army for like 100 years there." You know the struggle? But now there is a feature just for you: Expel minorites like Mister Stalin: Mr Hagelslag better pack your bags, because you will go to a vaction to AMERICA. Expel Minorites gets even worse: Rember what Paradox did with the religious conversion system? Making it expensive as fuck, so your dept is even rivals the one from the gyros boys. But not anymore: The answer is DEPORTION, like Uncle Joe teached us. Just put the heathens into nice bags and ship the over to mexico... No surprise that Mister Trump wants the wall.  Older trees must be upgraded and give permant bonuses too + paradox shouldnt lock this stuff behind a paywall
This one's very meh. I like the music and the new gameplay features, but it seems like it's not enough.
Adds very little in terms of game mechanics, instead focusing on buffing the hell out of already powerful Iberian nations through religious orders and extensive mission trees, making Spain even more powerful than they used to be. Ironically, this means playing with this dlc will actually reduce the variety of the games you play as Spain will reliably end up being rank 1-2 great power in late XVII century. They'll often gobble up half of Europe if they get Burgundian inheritance.  Long story short, you'll get very little value out of this DLC if you don't play Iberian nations often. It will however cause Spain to become the 'final boss' of most of your campaigns.
TL;DR:  This is the most content lacking release Paradox has created yet. Even the free patch features are problematic, and the paid features are not engaging/do not provide meaningful gameplay (aside from one). Bottom line, do not support Paradox's releases that have this little content. Either they simply missed their mark or didn't put in enough effort. I fear the latter.    This is, despite what the developers would say, not good content. You are simply not getting 10 dollars worth of content in this pack, and that is the first time I've said that about any expansion released for EU4.   The main features are:  Iberian mission trees - They are okay, but surprisingly less than what Poland received in a free patch  Iberian Holy orders - Iberian culture nations can sink 50 monarch points into a state for permanent buffs, and a +1 to dev for the monarch point used. These buffs aren't even that good, and not worth the monarch points whatsoever. The holy orders are also historically inaccurate.   Pirate republics - Small island nations with a lot of privateering power can reform into a pirate republic, allowing them to raid coasts on any religion. This is very powerful and great fun for roleplay, but it adds nothing to any other campaign. You will likely play a couple times and get the gist. Totally doable in a free update in my opinion.  Expel minorities - My personal favourite. You can now spend diplo points to convert a culture and religion of a stated province to be sent to a colonial region. This is very powerful, as it boosts development in their new home, and ignores both missionary cost, and culture conversion cost and time. This is usable by any nation, so its the only feature that warrants buying this, as the Iberian features are simply not worth it. My English colonies were filled with high development cultural cities, and some colonies were downright run by the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish. It adds a lot of flavour to colonisation. If anything it's a little overpowered, as historically the English were not the only ethnic group of Ireland scotland, coastal france, and other areas I converted.   Compared to the other region specific expansions, this one is a complete pass. While the expel minorities button is fantastic, it isn't worth buying when 90% of the rest of th expansion lacks significant content. Do not support Paradox when they produce this content lax releases.   Rule Brittannia was great. Several features non specific to Britain that warrant a purchase, and England is a must-play with the best mission tree in game. Third Rome is great for the same reasons, but I may be biased to the orthodox religion features and the russian region.    
Waste of money, I purchased this dlc so I could let you know not to.
HORRIBLE
A lot of nice stuff is added, but also a major bug that will make nations having trade companies virtually unplayable, making your game microfreeze every few seconds. The more provinces you have in trade companies, the more intense the microfreezes become. I started my first try at a world conquest with Castile, but have put it on hold now because my game became unplayable, microfreezing every 2 seconds. The freezes sometimes even interfere with commands you give. For those wondering, it has nothing to do with pc specifications.  January 7th one of the EU4 programmers announced that Paradox knows what the problem is. You would expect an immediate hotfix, but nothing so far. I paid 10 euro to have my game broken.   Paradox I love your games but this is an insult to your p(l)ayers. This should have been caught during testing, and fixed immediately. You can't release a DLC like this.
Not really playable until bugs will be fixed. I dont know why we have to wait so long for hotfixes, all issues are already reported for long time.
Basically this dlc is terrible. I don't know what made this dlc special, what I found different were those arbituary expulsions and that colonies are not converting native religions which make the game farther from the true historic logic.
No content for the price, lazy dlc policy:(
Paradox,you need to stop milking your loyal customers.Last DLC and this expansion pack just a disrespect to fans of this game,you just adding buttons and saying "these are the new mechanics of our game have fun".Another major problem is İberian nations deserves way bigger expansion and unique approaches to their way of colonization other than some buttons.Overall this expansion is a easy money trap to loyal customers.Hey Paradox! İf you need money just say,most of us will donate more money than that price!
Over priced for an over glorified content pack. You're paying for a reskinned republic, reskinned barrage and two new features which invlove a few more buttons. Not at all worth the price even 50% off
I only bought it cause I'm one of the hosts for a multiplayer group. Shit dlc, way overpriced, do not recommend buying.
Long time paradox fan, have bought all DLC in support of the continued patching.   The DLC doesn't add that much of interest, and the free patch in my opinion makes the game worse. I normally recommend buying the DLC in support of the free patches. But when a patch makes the game worse (referring to corruption, territories and religion) or less enjoyable, then I am going to have to rethink this in future.  For once, I highly recommend you DO NOT buy this expansion.
This DLC adds nothing of substance. A few new buttons but that is it.  - Orders have no drawbacks (other than the initial cost). They are literally just a button to click and then forget about  -Naval barages should be cheaper than normal artillery barages (like 50%) to make combatnavies slightly less useless  -Minority expulsion is the same thing as the orders. It is just another button to press  -Flagships are cool in concept but once again are little more than a gimmick  Stay clear of this DLC, even if you are a fan. And mission-trees should never ever be locked behind a paywall given that there are so many of simular or even better quality on the steam-workshop. You basically pay just to be able to get achievments at this point
....
Really disappointing.  Tried a playthrough of the new portugal. Same as before, except more free claims and you can siege down coastal forts quicker.   I think people should reconsider buying any more of these "immersion packs" till the already released one's have decent content.
Im playing as spain and when I converted to protestant I cannot declare holy orders anymore which means I cant complete missions.
I didn't get to expell enough minorities 1/10
Hey, Paradox, you think, that you can sell me 5 minor gameplay tweaks for 5 bucks? Eh, you can, cause i'm a poor stupid fanboy who already bought every other DLC to EU4, but at least i can make you a bad review for this. So here it is:  Don't buy this dlc for full price. Decide for yourself, but i think that these new minor immersions into Iberian affairs and building of Navy are so minor, that they do not worth their price, buy it only on sale(reaally big sale, cause "such great amounts of Paradox work and love" involved into developing this piece of... does not worth 5 bucks as other normal DLCs to EU4 on their start).
Usually I sort of like DLCs. Yes, EU4 definetely needs something new as now there are way too much of payed content and the paywall is only growing with each expansion. But they're at least adding something immersive and interesting. Here not only we have yet another product that a new EU4 player will have to buy (actually, in this case it feels so empty, it might as well be THE thing every guide will suggest to avoid) but also a decently priced DLC that has so little content, I would have never found out what was added if it wasn't for the changelogs.  I feel really confused: on one hand, they released another DLC which makes me want to complain about even more content being locked in a room that can only be opened with your credit card. On the other, it adds absolutely nothing, making it impossible for me to do what I mentioned.  I suggest you buy it just to leave a negative review.
Overpriced. Rather have the units released in a content pack.
You know I can forgive the amount of content in this DLC, it was light on it but I enjoyed what was there but what I can't forgive is an incredibly common and easy to trigger bug ruining the game late game making it through "testing". With this patch came a bug caused by trade companies that makes you game stutter constantly paused or not towards the late game and the only fix is to not have any territories enabled as trade companies. It's super easy to trigger this issue and should have been discovered by anyone trying an even remotely blobby campaign in testing. It's one thing to skimp on the content it's another thing to release buggy bullshit, I do not intend to support this dev team any further if this sort of shit continues. This was far from the only very obvious bug that came with this patch (broken attack natives button anyone?) Do not buy this supporting this lazy cash grab with minimal effort put into ensuring it was bug free.
You've put out some DLCs with questionable price/feature ratios but I've never complained, I like that you're still working on the game.  This is just terrible though... come on, you can do better.
This is not a good dlc.  Only buy if you want the complete expanded game.  Otherwise steer clear.    I'm rather disapointed in this Immersion pack after Rule Britannia.  They need to use thaat as the basis for IPs, this feels almost as bad as Third Rome, the first one.  RB added worldwide features like coal and naval doctrines, this confusingly relegated many of its own to iberia, even when features like the Holy Order were historicaslly used by France and oythers as well.  Jesuits are not exclusive to Iberia, look up St. Isaac Jogues.  Aslo with the expell minorities to the colonies, not allowing Russia to do this in Siberia was a hge missed oppurtunity, as that historically happened.  Let us just hope that our friends at PDS give us a fan favorite expansion like they did Holy Fury for Crusader Kings II next time aound.  PDS - This is strike 1.  You might lose me as a dlc loyalist when you hit strike three.
Now the optimal way of colonising is pressing a magic button that ships all of the people in a province to America and replaces them with your main population, leaving its development intact. Almost as historically absurd as physically impossible.
Worst of the immersion packs, they literally sell you mission trees.
This is the worst DLC ever made by Paradox Interactive...
This kind of DLC is convincing me to become a permanent pirate . :)
[h1]I'm Only Here for the Booty[/h1]  IF YOU DID NOT BUY THIS FOR THE PIRATES OR THE EXPULSION OF MINORITIES, YOU WILL BE SORELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DLC.  While CK2 just released a FULL EXPANSION PACK and "Stellaris" is now "Stellaris II" thanks to another earth-shattering rework that made it infinitely better, EU4 continues to churn out garbage in between decent full-size games.  If this DLC only had Pirates and Expluions of Minorities, I'd be giving it five of five poitns, because I FASTING LOVE PIRATES and the DLC delivered that well.  [U][B]PROS:[/B][/U] 1. PIRATES. Just.... PIRATES. YES PLEASE. Playable Pirates with great sandbox potential, flavor, and fun. This mechanic is amazing and I think it is a sorely needed addition to the game. This alone is the reason I bought the DLC. This is followed by- 2. Expulsion of Minorities. Colonial Nations no longer destroy every culture they overtake. Now, you can actually simulate real life accurately by putting your dirty Puritans on a boat for nowhere. When you Expel a Minority, the colonziing province is cheaper and 3. MISSIONARIES CAN CONVERT IN TERRITORIES AGAIN. Those who remember the Dharma disaster will remember the Free Patch that sunk the EP. It was the worst decision EU4's development board ever made, and they received such universal hatred that they rolled back their mistake and made a very acceptable, pleasing compromise. You can now convert in territories, but they cost more to do so, just like in real life!  These features are great, and I commend their addition. The pirates will probably be the most fun I've ever had with EU4.  [B]------------------------------------------------------[/B]  [U][B]CONS:[/B][/U]  Everything else. Spain and Portugal are OP and they don't need any more things to strengthen them.  1. The most OP nations in the game get more content to make them more OP. Weird Holy Orders only apply to them (not to Catholics). I literally didn't give a flying rat about this crap and I didn't buy it FOR ANYTHING THIS DLC WAS INTENDED TO CHANGE. 2. Naval Barrage makes no sense. You can't shoot Lisbon's castle, because downtown Lisbon was (and is) out of reach from a cannon. Who puts a castle on a seashore?! Jesus warned us about building on sand two thousand years ago! I literally didn't give a flying rat about this crap and I didn't buy it FOR ANYTHING THIS DLC WAS INTENDED TO CHANGE 3. Navarra is landlocked. Navarra was not landlocked in this time period. 4. Portugal didn't get the provinces people called for, but the Caribbean did get what was wanted, which is odd. I literally didn't give a flying rat about this crap and I didn't buy it FOR ANYTHING THIS DLC WAS INTENDED TO CHANGE 5. Absolutely nothing in this DLC, except pirates and Expulsion of Minorities applies to any other country, making this thing so narrow that no one is really going to play it. I literally didn't give a flying rat about this crap and I didn't buy it FOR ANYTHING THIS DLC WAS INTENDED TO CHANGE  [B]I DIDN'T BUY THIS DLC FOR ANYTHING THIS DLC WAS INTENDED TO CHANGE[/B]  While I got exactly what [B]I[/B] wanted, this was not "EU4: Booty Hunters" or "EU4: Get Those Pilgrims Out of Here". This was "EU4: Golden Century", and, by that metric, this DLC has failed.   ---  Final rating: 3/5 only came for the booty (IGN)
If you are thinking about buying Golden Century, I highly recommend you to reconsider. Golden Century adds nothing in terms of gameplay aside from a capital ship, which is a pretty neat idea in theory, and is arguably the only real feature GC actually adds. Let's look at what you really get out of this DLC besides the capital ship:  Expel Minorities: One time button you click. No strategy involved.  Christian Orders for Iberians: Also a one time button you click in the state menu, and you never see it again. Also each order is barely relevant for Iberians. They all have to do with cultural or religious conversion, which if you're playing in Iberia is already pretty hemogenous.   New Iberian Mission Trees: From the perspective of someone who played Eu4 right up until they added mission trees, and is now just getitng back into it, you can get this from a mod, and I also don't think the mission trees are particularly interesting or add anything. The Castilian tree is small and basically amounts to "unite spain, invade Britain, become HRE leader." That's it.  Pirate Republics: If you're into it it's fine, I honestly haven't played with the feature yet because it's so small as to not really be noticeable.   Naval Barrage: Adds small utility to a navy, but is unlikely to change your playstyle since most people already have canons anyways. Probably should have been included in the base game anyways.   Spend your money on literally any other DLC before this one.
So little effort on this "immersion pack".   - Lack of new events and government specificites (there were plenty to do with Castille/Spain regarding nobility and decentralized power) - No new ideas for Portugal while they were completely wrong (no naval idea for the best navy for half the timeframe ? Even Navarra which starts with no coastal province has one !) - No new mechanics about colonization or trade companies (Using natives one against others like they did ? No disease mechanics ?)  - Ahistorical things (Spain banning minorities in the new world !? Sorry never happened) - Pirates shit we didn't ask about and that visibly had more attention from devs than iberian nations  - One more province only for Portugal which is not even relevant, with fantasy shape, wrong capital in other provinces  - Portugal and Castille still being "friends"... This DLC was the opportunity to at least make them rivals like they were, with balance ajustments, making Luso-english alliance relevant... - New bugs including ones that were not existing before (like the Goa event that doesn't offer to obtain Goa anymore)  I'm french but I'd feel almost insulted if I was iberian (portuguese especially) and I'm now praying for France not being the next focus (PDX guys, please do Sweden).
Dear DDRJake,  please retire as Lead Game Designer or whatever your Job is called. You are doing it bad! This DLC is a desaster and the balance changes only show how little you actually understand of making a deep strategy game with choices worth thinking about. EU4 was once such a game, now its a railroaded crap game with shitton of tech debt.  Corruption for territories, missionary changes, end game tags, capital movement restrictions, braindead AI worse than in patch 1.13 all show how you want to enforce your playstyle upon everyone playing the game and how little you actually understand and are capable of as game designer. Meaningless features are getting added as the remaining team is incapable or producing anything more than bullshit balance changes and some art... This DLC is the proof. It hurts seeing a game I love getting destroyed like this.
While most people do say the pack is very lack luster and in some cases i could agree maybe. It adds a couple of really cool features. PROS  - I really like the pirate Republics and how the made it work with some of the changes and while i have not tried yet to do a full 1821 play through as a pirate from what ive tested it seems fun though for longterm campaigns i cant see you staying a pirate republic.  - I do belive with the explusion mechanic it tweaked colonializm a bit to where its more intresting to colonize now and its easier to spawn colonial cultures Like American, Canadian, ect..  - I actually like playing in Iberia now i never loaded a single game as Castille or Aragon or even portugal but with the small tweaks and the fact Castille is actually a viable nation now in MP makes it a lot more fun  - The cores in Iberia for not starting nations were fucked before this patch and now Catalonia/ Masories/ Leon/ and other nations really got to their historical borders.  - YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TEXAS BABY TIME TO ROUND UP ALL THEM IMMIGRANTS AND THROW THEM CROSS THAT BORDER GET THE LY- Alright im stopping there you get the point. I fucking love that Texas is in the game  - I really like the reworks with Espinoge (Fuck my spelling) and Infulence CONS  - This is deffiently not worth the money spent Because unlike Rule Britannia where it added so many cool and intresting features and such a unique tree for the British Isles and Byzantium (All hail to the Eastern Roman Empire) It was totally worth the money. Now with the Spanish Aragonese and other Iberian trees it just feels lack luster. Like Expels the Mores? as a mission? WHAT THE FUCK?! So you want me to desabalize my country for 100 diplo points. no, fuck you.  - There was no secret or easter egg nation that got a unique tree. like Byzantium got their own one. I feel Like to keep with the colonial theme you shouldve at least gave a unique tree to Someone funny. like Mali. Why? I dont know why not give us something different.   - The colonial "rework" is stupid and colonializm is just less fun to play with. Portugal in MP games just moves to Texas and never comes back. I really wish Texan was its own culture cause damnit i want texan culture.   - if youre gonna do a colonial rework you really should have listened to the community. Colonialism is Completly unbalanced as of like Third Rome when France got kicked in its balls 20 times and was forced into not playing colonial. they should have completly reworked native assimalation and settler chance and made historical region changes to the colonial mapmode.  - Nothing with Norway or the Scandiavians with their colonial ventures when this is supposed to edit colonial stuff slightly.   - WHy ThE fUCk dO I HaVE tO PAy MOnThLY 5 or mORe DUCaTs to CoNVerT 1 ProVENcE  - GiB Australian Ideas  All in all i do reccomend this DLC cause im a Diehard paradox fan and i know the developers do love this game you can see it in their eyes when they play with the Dev Clash. I just want a little more TLC into my DLCS before i waste my money On a country i never play. You dont NEED this DLC to have a fun expeirience with EU4 but If you like playing in Iberia i do reccomend you buy it
Minutes in, and bugs are keeping me from utilizing some of this dlc's features.  fucking amazing
If I'm gonna be honest, I found the naval barrage and the orders thing the most useful.  Everything else is pretty pointless.
I have no idea if this thing is any good, because for the first time ever, the new DLC crashes my game. I read all the other reviews and all the gripes seem bad enough, but seriously Paradox? You can't even bug fix enough for it not to introduce a 50% crash rate?
Very dissapointing, only buy if you think the unit packs are worth 9,99€   Update which should improve Iberia and make them more viable actually just nerfs them.  Lack on content for the price, if you complained about Third Rome then don't bother.
Very shallow, feels more like a mod than a payed DLC.
I do not ussually do a lot of reviews, but I needed for this one. The DLC does not add anything important or even 'significant' to Iberian region. It adds few useless mechanics that no one wanted like 'Orders' but only Iberians can do them (makes no sense) and it gives weird buffs. This DLC is really bad that they decided to combine with Content DLC to force people buy it in order to get Music and Unit Skins. It is very expensive and please do not buy it. I bought it cause I host games for my friends, I would not buy it otherwise.  Pros of this DLC: 1) Nice music and new units 2) New missions (I am not fan of missions since some are super Meme like Romanian one, and this DLC adds a meme mission for Aragon, but hey more missions = more flavours but its not realistic)  Neutral Things: 1) Flagships is a way to make your ships more powerful, but naval warfare in this game is weak so it doesn't change anything. And no one asked for it... They could of fixed NAVAL WARFARE and added new mechanics for that instead of adding this... 2) Pirate Republics sounds nice, but in MP = lots of your trade will now be hunted by them. No longer Knights and Berbers are unique nations to raid, which beats their 'unique' purpose  Cons of this DLC: 1) Too expensive 2) Naval barrage is useless since you pay Monarch points as regular Cannons 3) You can kick minorities to New World but not to other regions, which is weird 4) You can only do orders as Iberian culture, which makes no sense. You can do Sufi orders as Granada but not as other Muslim countries, like WTF. Ottoman Empire and other Muslim countries had lots of Sufi orders used for espacially Military or Religious reasons. If they made Orders for Catholics, and Sunnis and Shias, that would be more organized, instead of doing on cultures...
Too expensive for too little. Was okay with some immersion packs like the British one, felt like it was actually worth it. But this is pitiful.
Pirate Republics are boring as hell to play and that was basically the only interesting feature in this DLC.
I bought this after reading the dev diary ddrjake posted on the 18th. This is super content light, and I do not beleive it is worth my money, but I appreciate the honesty, directness and transparancy that Paradox has demonstrated. I'm glad they are slowing down to ensure better content,  and I hope they add more content to Golden Century in the next expansion, and when they do I will change my review to positive.
Better off giving the money to your favourite modding team. They put in more work and listen to the community more.
Ah yes the DLC which allows you to feel immersed while conquering the new world, what can i expect?  YEEEEEEHAW PIRATE REPUBLIC XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Total waste of money.
It's an immersion pack so it's automatically trash, (much like the Russia one which actually breaks AI Russia and the Britain one which is largely ineffectual).  Unfortunately this one is uniquely garbage, because unlike the other two, it doesn't even properly revamp the region it's focused on. Both Rule Britannia and Third Rome at least notably changed the regional mechanics. This one doesn't even do that. It has a couple of unit reskins, some boring naval garbage you don't really need or care for and last but not least, two clicky buttons.   This is a genuinely awful deal. The only reason I'm buying it is because I only play complete games out of principle, though in this instance Paradox really went a long way making me feel like a chump for it.
Worst dlc ever! Not worth it
So few add-ones/ I'm upset. Th British addition was much better. It's a stupid decision that for diplomatic points you relocate minorities, when you can just change culture. So... you have all the same problems with minorities. And it could just get rid of them
bad bad bad   Worst DLc ever!!!  don't know how to deal with the Religion problem.    
Don't buy it.
传教太贵
Very disappointed.  1.Many famous bugs are not fixed. 2.The religious ideas and humanist ideas are weakened unexpected.  3.Missionaries cost too much!
Why do you steal my money you pirates
Do I like the DLC yes, it is much better than Dhrama.  Is it worth the price - NO
For a DLC that's supposed to help Iberia be a more viable region compared to its competitors, this DLC delivers even more blows to the region, nerfs spanish ideas and nerfs colonization even more (as if the nerfs done in the previous update weren't enough).
Probably the most buggy, broken release of any update in this game ever. Somehow they managed to fuck up some really, really simple stuff. The content itself is fine if you want it, but it's still not worth $10.
This DLC represents little value. Unless you have a unit pack obsession or only play Spain/Portugal I would not recommend at all. There are no noteworthy gameplay changes with the possible exception of naval barrage.  Minority expulsion is obviously only useful to colonisers, although it is a good feature. The religious orders are forgettable, one click and you may never touch it again. Mission trees are nice but don't really affect gameplay too much. Pirate republics are ok. Flagships are pretty meaningless but a nice thought. Naval barrage should not be locked behind a pay wall as it can be quite impactful. Unit models are nice but don't affect gameplay at all.  TL;DR Music, unit models and a couple of gimmicks.
This is the first time that I am dissapointed with a DLC or Immersion Pack. And this is not because of the price or the quantity/quality of the content. We can argue about that as well, but in my opinion, it is "just" 10€, which is not that much, so one can not expect too much. Thats why it is called immersion pack. Sure, there is not much immersion there for Iberia, except some new mission trees.  There are two things which really annoy me.   1.) One of the "big" features" are the pirate nations. Sadly, you almost never get to see them, except for the one nation in SE Asia that starts as one. I have played until 1700 and not one of all the nations spawned.    2.) It is not playtested. There are so many bugs in this immersion pack, which ruin the fun for me. For example, some missions in the spanish tree are supposed to move the capital of your colonial nations. Instead they move your own Capital! So my Capital was moved from Toledo to Mexico City. This obviously does not work, since it belongs to my colonial nation. So, on the next day, another province was picked as my capital. In this case Guyenne was picked. This means I have to move it back for a cost of over 200 mp. This does not only make your capital more exposed, it also ruins trade, because your trade capital moves with it. This makes me feel like no one ever actually bothered to check those missions.  There are multiple other bugs due to this immersion pack. I have no problem with them releasing small DLCs and Immersion Packs and so far I always got 2 or 3 fun playthroughs out of them. But this is just infuriating.
There are som intresting changes like expelling minorities but in the end it´s not worth 9.99 euro. I had hoped that there would been more flavor to Portugal.
Not worth $10
CK2 with an amazing new content Holy Fury that adds a lot  Stellaris Le guine update with megacorp that change that game so much it seems to be a new stellaris game  Europa Universalis with dharma and now this Lazy "imersion pack"  overprice as always and with little content...  Is this a is this an out of season aprils fools joke EU4? who the f u c k is making this decicions in EU4 because CK2 and Stellaris are doing a great job
should be 4.99 dlc if your greedy company or a free update if you respect your community... and you dont respect your community Paradox, sorry :(
Preface: I want to preface this review knowing that I am currently enjoying a Castille-Spain game and have enjoyed their changed mission tree, with nice buffs that should have been there to begin with, though it is disappointing we didn't receive Tercios.  Pros:  Castille and Spain Mission trees feel fantastic, if a bit too quick to gain power to be fair.  Love Flagship addition to the game Love the pirate nations and added events Love the orders added for Iberian nations Enjoy the skins for ships and for the nations of this area Cons: WAY too pricey for the small amount of content Completely fucked Portugal over when it comes to balance in Iberia Morocco got fucked as well with their main source of income belonging to a vassal Castile is ridiculously OP Expelling minorities isn't as easy or useful or worthwhile as advertised Added a shit ton of provinces which makes WC even harder (which is okay I guess but why if not necessary? Just add dev) Barely any popup events have been added Castile got a buff AKA Granada is all worlds of fucked now AND THE BIG ONE PORTUGAL BARELY GOT ANYTHING BUT A DEBUFF AND A RETREAT TO BRAZIL. WHY. PORTUGAL WAS ALL OVER THE PLANET AND DID SO MUCH IN HISTORY WHY WOULD YOU EXCLUDE THEM PARADOX?  Conclusion:  This DLC is a LOT of fun but ONLY if you're playing as Castile, Aragon, Spain, or a Pirate Nation. The rest is fairly worthless and actually changes the meta in Europe and Africa substantially by fucking historically powerful countries over. I don't know why they did this to Portugal and Morocco, but I don't like it. This costs $10 USD. Really? Make a new DLC size called a "Feature Pack" with like the 5 features you added for $5 USD. Lazy ass Paradox, a shame EU4 is the only game going in the wrong direction. Please check out my youtube if you have the time, I will be posting Timelines, Lapses, Tutorial videos and a full review of the DLC as I continue to play it. Thanks   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYZfMweHtPdzsHljXytfySQ?view_as=subscriber
I've bought every DLC upon release since Cossacks, and this is bar far the one with the least innovation and worst QOL changes. I don't know what has been going on with the devs since Third Rome, but it seems that the game is now laser focused on adding changes that are viewed positively by the few people who expand six provinces in 400 years and despised by everyone else. The list goes on and on, from end game tags to conversions to now moving your capital to another continent only if you have as much development in that continent (Nice job sneaking that little change in there without telling the community). Now I get to pay $10 to listen to naval battle sounds that are never ending, can't even earn your incredible new pirate achievement because you re-broke earning achievements as a released tag, and the only real "flavor" that was added for Iberia was Holy Orders, which I can almost guarantee are only going to be used by the 10 people who want to ban the Andalusians to Guantanomo. This is not the quality that I have come to expect from Paradox over the past five years, but sadly it has become the new standard for profit-designed development progression. If things don't change fast, I may find myself reverting back to 1.25 and turning off updates. Please do better
I really wanted to like this, I really did. Finally doing a DLC about the peninsula where I live (I'm from Galicia, Spain) and give it some focus was something I wanted for a while by now.  ...but this is just crappy. Now, where do I even begin?  [list] [*]We have ahistorical provinces, like, why does Galicia have the modern 4 provinces, when it had 7 in medieval times, and why does Portugal only get 1 province that wasn't even anything special until wayyyy later.  [*]A group of names aren't even right, like Rousillon having its French name, when the Catalan name is Roselló, alongside the Balearic islands having English names rather than the proper Catalan ones (They should be Eivissa, Mallorca and Menorca). Now, if this wasn't an immersion pack [i]about Iberia[/I], I wouldn't mind it so much, but this is just dumb. It's like if you called Konstantinoupolis by its English na... Oh, wait. But, speaking of Iberia!  [*]...Portugal. What did they do to you? While not as culturally impacting as Spain at its peak, the Portuguese Empire was the first of its kind, that of the transcontinental empires, since the conquest of Ceuta, and still managed to leave an impact where it went. But how the game shows it, it might as well not be more than a random OPM. The missions have barely flavour, their claim to the castillan throne is just [I]claims on Iberia[/I] rather than a PU, unlike its Iberian partners which get PUs over each other like no tomorrow. Also, why move to Brazil and not even be able to form the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves? Now that would have been a cool addition for flavour! Like what this DLC was supossed to be!  [*]The ideas balance is all over the place. Navarra has ideas based around the sea which, while historically accurate, doesn't blend well with the state they have now, now that they lack a coast. And the Spanish idea nerfs are non-sensical. Spain was [b]the[/b] foremost European power during the first half of the timeframe of this game, both in land and sea, but the game doesn't do it justice at all. What about the Tercios? Or the Spanish navy? Both heavily influential on military advancements, and rulers of the European military doctrine for more than a century.  [*]The missions are cool, but again, all over the place. A trend that I noticed with the catholic Iberian powers is PUs. So many PUs. And missions with very unbalanced and weak rewards (why does aragon's final mission give them -1% power cost for a century, when the prior one gave me a mass of money and development?). But Iberia is not the only focus here...  [*]...Which brings us to Africa! With guest star Granada, because Muslim. Now, these are mostly alright, mainly because the higher core cost has finally been removed, which makes the region soo much more playable. Morroco losing its gold mine is kind of sucky, but it got vassals as a result, and vassals are OP so blah. Missions could be better, but I haven't played enough on that region to make a proper judgement.  [*]I can't say much about Granada neither, again, because haven't played it yet (I'm on the middle of a Navarra playthrough, but then I plan on doing Granada and then North Africa), but it looks like a decent time, albeit a bit too RNG for my liking. Buuut again, Byzantium is RNG hell as well, and doesn't stop people from playing, soo.  [*]About the new mechanics, they are not awful, but if I didn't know about them beforehand, I wouldn't even know about them. Holy orders? Press one button and forget. Pirate Nations? Custom republics for ironman, but can be somewhat replicated with the nation designer. Expel minorities? Novel, but not that useful really because of the fact of having to spend dip points to use it. Flagships? Again, novel but not really worth buying the DLC for. [/list]  And that's the theme with this DLC, it is just underwhelming all over the board. Which is shameful because, again, the Iberian powers were some of the most influencial ones of its time, well until the latter half of the timeline of EU4, and even by then they could be considered major players. It's pretty dumb how Paradox literally made a DLC more about everyone else BUT Iberia in a DLC that sells itself as an Inmersion Pack.  There are also a bunch of problems with this patch, but those are unaffected by this pack, so not really worth discussing about. 10€ for this is just a spit in the face, even 5€ would be questionable at best. Even Mare Nostrum was more focused than this... Although that one still is worse from an objective view point.   Just, dont buy. Unless its on discount, then you may buy it, but with a grain of salt nonetheless.
It's really not worth it. wait until X-mas sales and hope for atleast 50% off
Sad excuse for a DLC I was hoping it would be a poland patch worth paying for but left disappointed again, just left feeling unpolished and super unimpactful.
Honestly, I could hardly tell you what is different about the game, I want my 9.99 back as usual. Last DLC im buying unless future ones do something actually good.
After all the issues with previous immersion packs, you would think that Paradox would have listened and given game changing content for a region at a resonable price. They have not. Thanks Paradox for turning grand stratergy into a grand mess.
its a solid "alright"
A game should try to  create more gameplay for players rather than limit our creativity. I don't think these updates are making this game better. Balance should never been the key point of this game.  The interesting thing about the EU4 is that countries  have different features, so that players can use them to expand their territory and power.   AND YES! EXPANSION IS THE THEME OF THIS GAME, EXPAN YOUR COUNTRY DIPLOMATICALLY OR MILITARILY, IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME.  IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE RELIGION PART, MAKE IT BACK TO 1.25! IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO STOP THE GOD-PLAYER FROM DOMINATING THE WORD IN THE 16th CENTURY, DO NOT MAKE 'THREE MOUNTAINS' BECOME AN MISSION IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AVERAGE-PLAYER!  PLUS: Since dharma DLC. Only music is worth the price.
The flagship and naval barrage are the only things that are really noticable in game, the mission trees are pretty lame, the pirate republics seem exceedingly weak. This should have been a free update, there is barely anything here and for $9.99 USD it kinda feels like Paradox either cut the meat of the content out or made it free. TL:DR wait for it to be at least 50% off if not more, this isn't much of a dlc.
Dlc is overpriced as always. Good job Paradox, also fuck you.
Very, very disgraceful from Paradocks. Here are  my notes on this scam which they call DLC:  - Only one soundtrack for the Spanish theme. They couldn't differentiate between peace and war so it is played either way. I expected a lot more on the soundtrack aspect of the Spanish update  - Silly updates regarding mechanics. My 15 yro cousin could have modded it for me and I would have paid him money without feeling regret  - You just messed up the game more by ruining colonial experience. Every new DLC just increases the admin points to be consumed, making it harder to expand. It is now 1526 AD and I barely got my first Mexican colony. Caribbean already got several colonies. In former patches I used to rule the Caribbean by 1525. Big difference.  - It is already bad enough for Spain to be bankrupt in the past several patches, now it has gotten worse. I literally have no cannons (to save money), and my army amounts to 26,000 soldiers, which is exactly the same number I began with in 1444. You just can't afford it when playing Spain, or any other nation for that matter.  - Hmmm, where are the pirate mechanics? I do not see any piratey stuff or any other changes for that matter.  - They added a portrait of a Spanish king in the loading screen. Ok I'll give you $0.1 worth for the effort, but the rest of my $9.9, where is it gone towards?  - Spain was one of the golden blossoms of the 16th and 17th centuries. Why the fuck are the kings so terrible in EU4? One of the reasons why I was late to get to the colonial world is due to horrible leaders. Additionally, these silly events that drain stability keep popping up.    If you idiots for once begin to think, maybe you can revert all the damages you've done to this game the past dozen or so patches. As a starter, increase all income, and lower MP consumption. Let players enjoy their game you silly billies. From my frustration in losing $10 and plenty more, I curse Paradox and pray you and your loved ones get cancer of the eye.   First and last edit: I gave up on 1557. I saw in the mission tree of Spain that there is a mission when you finish you get Hernan Cortez as a conquistador. LOL! I am so far away from conquering the Incans, and not even 40% through with the Mexican nations, and over half of Caribbean. Morocco and Tunis are so powerful, I don't have the army to launch an offensive, and in the early stages of the game I was focused on saving MP for colonial ambitions. I have 5 merchants, with a combined army of 35,000, yet I am barely hitting the +3 income mark. I only have 1 manufactury built, and from the Hunt of the Seven Cities or whatever, I just got one gold hit with 200 ducats.... that's all.  This is an insult to the legacy Spain left in history. I am ashamed that I was part of this insult. I was dying to play Portugal after this, but I guess that would not be a good idea for my blood pressure. This is not the first or the second or even the third time that I play Spain without enjoying at all. Spain was my favorite nation to play long before the silly Common Sense update came. After that, economy just ruined the fun of playing Iberia.  Again, fuck you Paracocks and I hope your new game utterly fails when people realize how much of scammers you guys really are.
In my opinion, the features of this DLC is good, but they lack some depth like pirates, and theres way too less features that it would justify the price. In addition, they can just add new missions for countries and justify it as a part of DLC then adding less actual features. I hope they improve with the next dlc.
10 bucks for Iberian mission trees. No, just no!
Very disappointing. The DLC doesn't have any major gameplay impact. You could play without this DLC and wouldn't notice it.
I bought it because I'm a whore and an addict, but it really isn't worth picking up until it's on sale. My main gripe, though, is how astonishingly little the devs did for Portugal, even after people on the forums asked them endlessly about it and gave them heaps of potentially fantastic suggestions. Seriously, how difficult is it to fix their national ideas so they don't have the same shitty trade modifier twice?
Immersion Pack that doesn't actually make anything more immersive...   Iberian Immersion pack that barely touches Iberia outside of mission trees..   Pathetic. Also you get banned on the forums for calling it lazy work.
Entirely not worth the price, what should have been a fully fledged and considered piece of content is nothing more than a scant offering of poor quality content and ill considered mechanics.  Europa is quickly growing to be a game I will not reinvest in due to the sheer lack of content control the developers seem to be predisposed towards.
Yea we're getting ripped off. Yay for dlc but seriously paradox these prices are disgusting for the small changes they offer. I feel taken by force from behind and I am paying the culprit 9,99 to pull out 0.1 inches  Thumbs up for game, thumbs down for these mediocre dlcs
Worst dlc ever
One of the worst dlcs, Paradox has ever released, even if you like Spain, Iberia, pirates or colonization. The features are simply too weak for the price. Wait for 50% off before buying.
The worst addon ever
WHY ARE THE KNIGHTS NOT ALLOWD TO RAISE THE BLACK BLAG? THE FUCK PARADOX?
The requirement for hoisting the black flag is confusing. Playing as morrocco is hard since whoever rivals you supports your vassals (which apparently is so easy but why did Paradox break up morrocco and made it into small vassals is beyond me) and they all end up destroying you. their opinion of me was so high but that didn't really matter they'll declare war on you regardless because castile/Tunisia/Tlemcen will always support your vassals which in turn will cripple you from the beginning. Did not like the update and DLC doesn't really add much depth to pirating. I hope for some few fixes to make Morrocco a little playable. I like some of the things about the new update and dlc such as the new looks and flagship. I like the new map.
Not worth the price, I hope they change their DLC/Immersion Pack policy
Wanted an Iberian DLC, ended up with a pirate meme instead.
Doesn't add much to the game, and what was added doesn't make the game more interesting or fun.   I remember playing Russia and England after their respective immersion packs I had a blast conquering the planet. I just booted up a Castille game after buying this DLC and it feels pretty much the same.   The Flagship is kind of cool tho?
Very little content, especially for Iberia. Missed opportunity and a let-down. Don't buy.
(TL;DR) If you play a lot in Iberia, play colonisers a lot, or want to play a pirate nation, consider this a yes recommendation. Otherwise, wait for a sale or don't buy it at all.  The reason I can't really recommend this for the general playerbase is because the actual paid content, and not the stuff that comes with the free patch, can pretty much be replaced with mods or just gives you more buttons to press every 5-10 years, or falls under "neat idea, but is it worth paying $14.50 Australian Dollarydoos for?"  I like minority expulsion as an idea, and it was definitely prevalent in places like GB, but I'm pretty sure that Spain didn't expel minorities to the new world. I could be wrong though. It boosts the dev in colonies while ensuring the ethnic purity™ of your home land, while costing you bird mana. Good for pretty much all colonisers as a utility tool. (EDIT: Minority Expulsion is overpowered as heck. As Castille, if you get the Burgundian Inheritance around 1480, get the Council of the Indies government reform, and complete the Exploration tree as normal, you can have the Netherlands clear of Dutch people by about 1510. That means that the Dutch revolts won't fire and the Netherlands won't break free, the whole Low Countries won't have the unaccepted culture malus, which is an extra 33% tax and manpower you'll get out of the region, and expelling cultures is cheaper and faster than normal colonisation. On top of that, it basically creates free development at the place you expel them to, with no debuff to the place they're expelled from. All at the cost of Diplo points, which are the easiest points to stockpile.)  The three orders are just three buttons which are a flat cost (50 of any power) development with a minor bonus on top. Only downside is that only catholic iberians can use it, meaning there's less incentive to go an ahistorically protestant or reformed iberian nation. (2ND EDIT: You can use holy orders on your own states, your vassal's states, and your colonial's states. For just 50 of any given power, you can get on average 4-5 development per state you put the holy order in. Just in case it needs to be said outright; this is overpowered as heck. Pretty sure you can also do some shenanigans where you lose one of the provinces in the state, which resets the holy order in said state, letting you spend 50 of a power to get another 4-5 development.)  The mission trees are neat, I guess, but you can find better ones for free on the workshop. I haven't played enough to tell you how over or underpowered they are, but assuming it's anything like the Rule Brittania mission trees, it'll give you a sense of direction throughout the game. A definite positive if you play ironman for the achievements. (EDIT: They managed to make the Purple Phoenix of Iberia (White Flower? Whatever.) over powered. In a couple of test runs when I played out of Iberia, Granada usually allies the Ottomans/Mamluks/Some Berbers which scares Castille off from attacking them. From there they either expand into Portugal, expand into Morroco, or expand into Andalusia after Aragon attacks Castille. They're supposed to be a doomed start, not blobbing 4/5 games.)  The pirate republics are kind of a niche thing, and something that I won't see myself playing, so I'll refrain from commenting on their usefulness. Basically, if you're buying the DLC for pirates, it doesn't matter what I say, if you don't care about pirates, then there's no way of me convincing you otherwise. (EDIT: the AI pirate republics never amount to anything, so this is pretty much only a feature if you want to play as a pirate republic.)  The flag ships are cool, for lack of a better term. They basically add up to three mini-national ideas to a specific fleet of yours. All of them seem good, but there will definitely be a meta of which ones are best for which kinds of fleets. (EDIT: Flag ships are just a bonus on top for if you're already winning. Add the trade flag ship to your 50 light ship fleet to add 50 trade power. Add speed and combat width to your combat fleet so that you can clear out the enemy ships faster. Add troop speed to your transport fleet so your people can get on and off the ships faster. By the time you have the navy and economy to build support a flag ship, you should already be dominating the seas. If you aren't dominating the seas, then there's no real point in building one.)  Naval barrage is just cannon breach walls before you have artillery. No point in using it after getting artillery because, well, artillery should be in pretty much all of your armies for the faster sieges. It also has the same flat 50 sword mana cost that the artillery barrage. I also understand it's for game balance reasons, but how does ordering your ships to fire on a fort off the coasts of Africa set back your military tech by 1/12th? They could have made it more interesting by using bird mana, a lower sword mana, or some mixture of the two. (EDIT: Practically not a feature. The forts that you want taken down faster in the early game are the inland mountain ones where you don't want your troops taking attrition ticks they don't need to. Besides, early game you should be saving your mil points to rush mil techs anyway for the tactics bonus, which is much more important than finishing off a fort 1-2 months earlier.)  (EDIT: Unless you play zoomed in enough to see the unit models, they don't impact your experience at all. So if you're the kind of person that likes zooming in really close and admiring your dudes, then go for it. If not, then consider buying/not buying the DLC on the other points.  If I could give this rating a mixed recommendation then I would. It's basically like the other immersion packs, great if you are playing in the region or playing against someone in the region, but otherwise has no impact on your gameplay. Basically, read the TL;DR.
I just want to say that having bought all dlc at launch since MoH (started playing in RoM), this is the 1st DLC i actually think is not worth my money. I only bought it in hopes it gets changed later and because i play a lot (like more than 700h) in iberia. Mission trees are the only interesting thing in the DLC because all other mechanics are buttons or fantasy pirate related. This is not worth your money bear in mind that. Mission trees are easily made with a mod. If this IP ever gets changed to something better I will for sure change the review.
Holy orders are good. But they made colonising early on as portugal less fun and slower.
This has gone too far, my friends can't even play this game without me any more there is TOO MUCH DLC and the worst part is important buttons I rely on are locked behing paywalls, including the add unit button, army templates, developing provinces this culminates in me paying 10 dollars to naval siege, which should have been in this game since art of war
Don't buy. Just don't. I did and I regret it.
Not worth 10$.
Ordering a naval barrage crashed my game...
Don’t.
dissapointment...
I have not play much time with this expansion time but thera is something that is intolerable. What flag have you chose for Valencia? That is not the valencian flag. And for god´s sake am not talking about the language but abaut the culture. Valencians are not catalans. We can share language but our cultures are not the same. And the capital of the crown of Aragon was Zaragoza not Valencia.
don't bother
really fucking annoying lmfao
so i have some issues with this game first one the audio balance is awful some sounds are so loud i can hear them when not wearing my headset some i cannot hear  second the enemy bance is non existent most of the enemys are yust no chalange bot some are yust a spike in dificulty  
I love the graphics. I love Unity engine. Game looks beautiful, but this is waste of money for now.  Game needs some polish, like Options Menu or level complexity. To many ways to go at the begining with hidden stuff without reasonable tutorial. I spend 22 minutues playing. That was few days ago. Now I'm gonna to uninstall it. Will come back later if game get more updates. For now there is no fun for me in that game.
Underwhelming to say the least. There's about fifteen minutes of new content here.
Wow I can't believe they even dare charge as much for so little content. It took me less than an hour to complete the new and extremely simple quests. There is no new major content, no new ships no substantial story arc.  It hardly has any content. For an expansion that costs as much as the original game I can't believe they would put in so little effort.   Don't buy this, its just as close as a scam as it can be without being called one.
Did you like Goldeneye?  How about Perfect Dark? TimeSplitters?  You did? Wow, you must be excited to see this game available for only $2 on Steam! Start with a pretty little title screen, and go to the "about" section. It's full of useful information pertaining to the well-made game you are about to play.  Start with a rather unique loading screen that takes forever, even with a beefed-up computer and feel your anticipation build for the all the FPS-y goodness you are about to experience! But, don't touch that mouse or key,board, or else you'll have to close out all the background windows through Task Manager and start all over again! Once you can finally wait for the full three minutes for the game to load without getting too antsy, you are treated to some  state-of-the-art PS2-style retro graphics. As the game states, you have a variety of weapons to choose from on a table next to you. Your varieties are the iconic Colt 1911, the well-known Colt 1911, the ubiquitous Colt 1911, or the ever-popular Colt 1911. After picking up the Colt 1911, resist the urge to grab the extra clip! If you do pick it up as you start the game with only 10 bullets, the guards who can see through the tent flap will frag your face faster than you can say,  "Game over, Man!" Enjoy hours and hours of getting blasted away by the first two enemies who can take you down in 3 shots to the hand! Hooray! This was the best use of $2 I had since that time I bought a lottery ticket, won $4, spent that on 2 lottery tickets and lost! Awesome!  If you have a crippling addiction to games like Halo, Call of Duty, or PlayerUnknown, this will cure you for good!
Broken.
The title of the game is misleading Casino which proves to be a bad solitaire game. The colors of the cards are difficult to distinguish. The gripping of the individual cards is very poorly implemented. Moving the individual cards is a disaster. Double-click feature was not considered to make it easier to stack cards on the target stack, as you know it from the Microsoft Solitaire game.  The whole game has fun factor of zero. Warning for Achievement Hunters broken Achievements 82/100 only 18 are unlocked.
Poorly done solitaire game. card deck is not well colored. Very hard to grab cards, and snap cards. No auto layout of non used cards. Achievements do not start at all.. All one can do is restart the game over and over again.  Oh, I forgot where are the poker chips, and where are the dice? Casino????????????? Hmm!
Poorly made Solitaire. Just randomly laid out cards, with a timer ticking. Sky high FPS. Lousy drag and snappings of card rows. All stages seems unlocked after first play, with all remaining bugged achievements. Replay, Replay and blindly Replayings  ...  just to find a perfect set to complete.   Purchase made solely for the alphabets achievement, and yet simply fails to trigger.   Not worthy even with the cheap price, discount, or nonexistent developer.  DO NOT BUY nor support  FIRST_UKRAINIAN  products.
Not terribly satisfying combat, paired with character development that is slow and grindy. The level generator lacks any sort of interesting layouts, to the extent that it would probably be more fun to play the same hand made level over and over again. Some of the weapon and item drops are moderately interesting, but it's definitely not up to nuclear throne level.
WARNING WARNING  WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING  THIS GAME IS NOT ONLINE ITS ONLY LOCAL U CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME MULTIPLAYER ITS ONLY LOCAL I BOUGH THIS GAME TO PLAY MY FRIEND ITS SAYS ONLINE MULTIPLAYER LOCAL COOP AND SHIT NONE IS TRUE ITS ONLY LOCAL  
anyone who has played this game, you understand why i am making this review, i am terrible at this therefore the game must be bad, its obvious, and i played this game for 2 hours and 1 of hours being on the LAST LEVEL OF THE GAME THAT I STILL HAVENT BEATEN BECAUSE ITS SO HARD PLEASE MAKE AN EASY MODE
The italian translation is a mess, Microids clearly used some automatic tool but the result is so poor that translate into a bunch of random italian words put together with no sense at all. You can't change the language to english because developers hardcoded the language change to the operative system so to play in english I need to switch Windows 10 to english as well (the built-in option to change language via Steam doesn't work at all).
Impossible to play properly with Keyboard controls, and would not accept my DirectInput gamepad. Might be playable on a 360 controller but not everyone owns one and I don't fancy getting arthritis trying to constantly press four buttons with my left hand. In the gameplay department: invincibility period after being hit is not long enough, no hit stop, tiny jump height that falls way too quickly, and is visually confusing as to when your shots are connecting (to say nothing of the visual clutter more generally speaking).
Gameplay consists of failing over-and-over until you get lucky. If you stick through each round, it'll reward you with about 3 sentences and, eventually, an anime girl without clothes.
At the moment, I just can't justify telling folks to download this, as it's simply not far enough in development.  I love the concept of the game, however I can't stand how it essentially tells you where to place everything. If the game options were to actually be implemented, I'd love to see that be a toggle-able option, so that users are able to make mistakes, or solve level though trial and error, rather than simply dragging the shape around until a green highlight is shown.
Absolutely not.  Buggy as hell.  Half-implemented.  The controls were so bad that I still don't know if there are any enemies in the game because I couldn't play long enough to find out.  The character moves very slowly and the jetpack activation is very unresponsive. The character frequently plays the falling animation when standing still on flat ground. When walking off of a ledge, no falling animation is played; the character disappears from the top of the ledge and instantly appears at the bottom. There's no jumping, and you can't walk up stairs. You must use the unresponsive jetpack to get up even the shortest step up. It feels more like I'm controlling a slow, heavy mech than a platformer character.
Artworks not bad.   Where the game fails for me is the gameplay. a very simple tile matching game unlocks pictures. It took me about 200+ moves to unlock the first one. Twenty minutes to do the first picture. Strikes me as a really poor design choice that increases the length of time needs on what should be a casual game.   I don't think the art is worth the effort. What could have been a fun achievement clicker with half decent artwork has been devalued by poor design choices.
I was unable to play this, so I had to make a refund. The start menu was all messed up (start new game, graphics, sound section was almost over eachother), and when I got into the game and started clicking on items the game freezed/crashed, even esc button wouldn`t work to quit the game. I had to use the windows button to close the game. I tried several times restarting the game, but the problem still occured. It might be a decent game, but it surely has some mechanical problems, so it could be a risky game to buy.
[h1]■■■□□□□□□□ 3 / 10[/h1]  Quantum Retribution is another unfinished product that doesn't seem to have been properly playtested prior to its release. It can be completed in roughly one hour, but that doesn't mean that it should be.  Essentially, this is an escape room. You wake up, not knowing who you are and how you got there. By way of several questions (trials) you gradually uncover the truth. The thing is, the topic for these questions seems completely random so unless you just so happen to know all about it, you'll end up Googling your way through. In fact, at one point the game even suggests that you do..  Visually, the game isn't much to look at either. Even though everything takes place in one room, most textures are still bland and low-res. Oddly enough, the main menu is the most satisfying thing to look at. The game also suffers from a number of sporadic bugs such as clipping, getting stuck between chairs (at a specific point) or choices not (fully) registering, all of which results in having to quit to main menu and continue from there. And, although a minor gripe, there are also numerous language mistakes.  Quantum Retribution is a sloppy and buggy release with not enough effort put into it from any creative standpoint. It's a shame, too, because the first 10 minutes or so start out somewhat promising and the sound design is actually pretty decent. However, while it might have been good practice for the developers, it's just not something worth spending your money on.
The units should have been available in-game without having to pay for unlock-file- dlc.
[h1]This is atrocious! [/h1]  Mark ignore and skip this in your queue. This is wrong in so many levels, but mainly in the controls. The game demands a control to play, mouse and keyboard are not working for me, even after remaping the dash. You need precise controls to play it, so many insta-death spikes and saws, but the movement is akward and not being ableto configure a controle is doom here. It tries to push that Super Meat Boy feeling so you can buy the game, and it worked with me, unfortunaly, make no mistake, this is just a trap to grab your money. Save your pennies, give it to the homeless or the church, but DO NOT support this.
... God blessing me because this game isn't bad. Extremely hard esspecially for beginners. Firstly the game includes a tutorial... There is no turorial,I stuck in the lvl2 stage because there was a button what I didn't push. Secondly there are phases where you can only go throught, if you try the level 15 times and learn the all map to avoid irrevocable actions.Like I pushed a cube the right way and I couldn't bring back left. Thirdly,Checkpoints are very far away and you will rage if you are not pro in parkour platform games. Fourthly I had some very irritating bugs like I stood on a moving platform when the game had a checkpoint and always when I died I fell throught it and died again.I needed to restart the map again and suck with the elements or another example when the cube went throught the moving platform and I couldn't bring back. Fifthly I liked the music. I am not a fan of dupstep but I liked it. The game is 4 euro it worth the price because the background is unique and the puzzles too.
The year is $current_year and a new platformer using keyboard and mouse controls has arrived. I don't know what they were thinking not even considering controller support which is how platformers are meant to be played.  Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the controls are awful, and the fact that you have to use keyboard for movement makes it worse. I want to use my thumb on a pad or stick when doing tedious wall jumps, not alternate between fingers on two separate keys.  I hope the devs add solid controller support in the future. Until then, I am refunding my $0.49.
Paid £0.39 for this game and was somehow dissapointed.  Just play Super Meat Boy, it's superior in every way!   Pros: -Cool soundtrack   Cons: -Slow character  -Awful controls -Easy puzzles, made hard due to ridiculous controls -Everything else!
This was an enormously disappointmenting experience. The controls in this game are truly awful. It is a very frustrating game because you yourself are your own worst enemy: 99% of deaths will be the result of a failed wall jump that needs to be followed by a double jump. The puzzles themselves are dead easy and the enemies are actually fun to fight. But instead of the platforming being a pleasant part of the game, your most difficult challenge in this game will be to jump onto a ledge and not fall to your death. You are constantly struggling to make the jumps instead of being able to focus on battling your enemies. The game looks great and the music soundtrack is nice too, but the constant struggle with controlling your character completely spoiled the fun for me.
I bought this game at 88% discount and... I want my 59 cents back. The translation is awful. And I mean AWFUL. It's not just some gramatical mistakes, I don't even understand what characters did say sometimes. In current state this game is unreadable. If you are reading this just... don't buy it. Don't waste your money.
Not worth the money. Half of the new beasts you will skip every time you see them. Fighting Unhold is challenging and fun, but the rest of the encounters are more annoying than engaging. After release they did a series of hotfixes to address player complaints about this issue, but there's not much you can do about overall design flaws I guess. Buy if $5, but not worth $15.
DLC ruined the game. Creatures just don't make the game better and in many times ruin any fun. Alps for example. The worst. And I have to constantly save scum just to avoid them. It'd be better to have an option to turn off something of the bad decisions of the developers if they can't do things well.
I don't like this DLC. Some of the enemies are ridiculous. For example: Alps. They spawn endless shadows and it takes so long to fight them that it stops being enjoyable and feels more like a chore. I love the game, but not the DLC. The other enemies that come in the DLC are pretty cool, like the Hag (Hexe I think she's called) but the Alps ruin it for me. I encountered them early game and it was so ridiculously difficult to fight them. I won, but not without a lot of damage being taken in return. I suppose that's the point, but I feel they went a bit overboard with them being able to spawn 2 shadows every single turn, move, and possibly even mind attack. Then, the shadows all go before you, so you can't stop them and they get hits on nearly every single roll it seems and 2-3 hits and your guys die no matter what gear they have because it's a psychokinetic attack. Very frustrating.
I wanna start by saying, that I absolutely admire Battle Brothers for what it is: Probably the best tactical RPG available today. But this review cannot be about the base game, it has to be about the DLC. And after about 200 hours of playing the DLC and ~600 days over 7 campaigns, I have to say that the DLC does not add as much in reality as it promises on paper.  The new things that are good in the DLC are great, but to many additions are either dulling the game down, are only interesting for a very limited number of days or introduce "challenges" that you'd just avoid because they are boring and unrewarding.  I want to give you a few examples:  [h1]New enemies[/h1]  There are 5 new enemies, but only 2 of them are ever worth fighting: Spiders and Unholds. Schrats could be cool, but have some balancing issues and force you to take axe mastery, limiting weapon choice and build variety. Alps and Hexen share the same core problem: They are extremely boring to fight. Alps in particular have been reworked in a way that result in 20-30 turn battles with minimal progression over the course of the battle. So if you purchase the DLC, be aware that only 2 out of 5 enemies are actually worth encountering.  [h1]Inventory management[/h1]  The inventory management has become much worse overall. You have the choice of either carrying a few crafting materials to make use of the new crafting system, or having enough space to carry actual equipment and loot. This problem persists as you upgrade your wagon throughout the game, as you probably acquire some rare materials and items that you don't want to toss away. So you end up throwing away and selling crafting material, rather than collecting them to find new recipes and to engage in the new crafting system. Which is a shame.  [h1]New crafting system[/h1]  The new crafting system has a couple recipes that I really like. It also has a whole lot of recipes that I never use, like a bunch of paints (which you can simply buy from marketplaces) and potions (for which you have no space to carry them around).  [h1]Potions and consumables[/h1]  On the topic of potions and consumables, be aware that the inventory has been reworked in a way that removes the 'consumable' slot. All single-use items are now stored where you previously stored daggers and spare shields, ammunition and such: In your mercenary's bags. This includes the bandage and antidote, which means you pretty much have to choose one single item out of all of them, which means it will most likely be the bandage, given how common bleeding is. This means that all the new potions are never given a real chance, because better and cheaper items just compete for the same slot. It doesn't help that all but one of the new potions are pretty useless.  [h1]New map[/h1]  The new map is nice, but it also introduces a few problems, like travelling times being longer on most maps and swamps and forests spanning huge areas, allowing for very limited exploration.  The difference between a "good map seed" and a bad one has never been more impactful.  [h1]The good stuff[/h1]  There is also good in this DLC, like the new visual design, some AI improvements, new end-game challenges and such. But it all falls a bit short when you consider that most players are actively avoiding taking part in 50% of the new content.  [h1]TL:DR[/h1] If you are okay with getting half of the advertised DLC for full price, those 50% will still be adding a good amount of stuff to a great base game. Just be aware you will run into 'dead content' that you will only ever touch once, if at all.
Stupid Alps changed, destroy the fun of this stupid game. Endless shadows? Misses combo? Even you couldn't retreat from this stupid fight once you engaged a 10+ Alps battle. Those shadows can 100% hits but players can't. Failure design. And I hate the cheating dices, the difficult is only based on dices cheating? Totally bullshxt!!  These not fun, you guys just wasted my time.
After giving this DLC a good try I finally realized that it actually makes me enjoy the base game less.  I like everything the DLC added to the game (weapons, armor paint, etc.) except the new monsters.    But considering the DLC is mostly about the monsters that is a fatal flaw.  The giants are cool and the spiders are ok but almost all of the other new beasts I find myself going out of my way to avoid since none of them are very fun to fight.  Having the team chained with status debuffs isn't very interesting without at least a mix of other troops to support the casters.
I decided I had to review the expansion after recent "fixes." For reference: I reviewed the base game with a "thumbs up". I won't focus this review on anything that also pertains to the base game. IE: this is a rogue-like, grindy, tactical, turnbased, RNG game... If you won't like any of that, don't buy either. If you will, read on.  This expansion added, much needed, new and variable enemies in the form of beasts, trolls, witches, and a few other forest type creatures. All the enemies added have unique mechanics that require special strategies to overcome. This fixes a huge problem of the first game; you pretty much just fought variants of humanoid armies that had access to the same weapons as you, and therefore, would use the same type of strategy depending on those armaments. Combined with the grindyness of progression, this led to encounters getting stale.   It also adds a bunch of items, clearly taken as "trophies" from the forest creatures, most of which are special attachments or cosmetics to improve the look of your company. This is great for making your company feel unique and giving it some flavor. Plus, some are pretty dang good stat-wise.  Yet, I can't recommend this expansion until there are some major fixes to the added mobs. The early game adds come with new mechanics that pose a unique threat, but once understood are fairly easy to deal with, assuming you are properly equipped and prepared. However, the mid and late game mobs are horrendously unbalanced. You may see people complain of "Hexen" and "Alps" in some other reviews. Their concerns are warranted.  Hexen are a mob that have two very nasty abilities. First, they can charm your men for 2 turns, on a one turn cooldown... The problem with this should be clear; a single hexen could potentially have two of your men charmed at once. Even with high resistances, I found my guys got charmed at least 50% of the time. Annoyingly, you can't even see what the hexen's chance of charming you is (although, you can normally see most other %'s in the game)... So, you really don't know how lucky/unlucky you are getting, or even if it's cost effective to pump the stat for resistance. They also have an ability that links their health to that of one of your brother's. This means that as you kill a hexen, you kill one of your brothers... This would be fine on it's own, but combined with the charm mechanic, means every fight with these "witches" will probably have losses.   Alps are another broken addition and the one that got "fixed". I did not have a huge issue with original alps. They were unique, using a combo of two moves to put your men to sleep (resistable by will) and then kill them with nightmares. They had no innate physical attack and could not do the combo in one turn. Your troops could wake each other up to stop the combo. IE: you always had a chance to wake a brother up before things got dire. The fights were positioning and movement focused, requiring you to maneuver your men in a way that you could wake each other up, but also, coral and trap the alps. This was challenging at first, but, in my opinion, doable even in the early game or with low resistance. New Alps had the combo stripped away. It was replaced with a summon ability that creates 2 mobs by one of your brothers. These mobs die instantly, but have high defense, and ignore armor. Here's the kicker; each alp can cast it every turn... Saying they add fast is an understatement. There's a lot of reasons why this breaks the game mechanically and for word count I won’t go into it. It’s a poorly implemented mechanic that leads to unwinnable fights. Unwinnable fights are extremely frustrating and a bad design in a rogue-like game that is suggested to be played on iron-man.  I do not recommend the expansion at this point. Wait until the devs do a fix that the community endorses as functional. I will say this: both of them would be pretty easily fixed by either capping the number of mobs in each fight, or simply making these awful abilities have limited uses. Regardless, something is needed to make the game playable in Iron-man again.
First impression was very good. But once your campaign hit day 50, HUGE flaws start to appear. The DLC is *full* of bugs. The game saving engine they use has been broken. It takes multiple seconds to autosave on ironmode effectively freezing your computer while the frames keep on running. Thats not elegant (irresponsive behaviour) but ok for indie. Whats not OK -for indie as well- is that it crashes and crashes a LOT. It crashes on pathing, it crashes on using new weapons, it crashes on game saves, it crashes and crashes... They clearly tested only the T1 weapons on T1 enemies in basic maps. Some crashes corrupt the game files and your ironman campaign is gone for ever.  Also they introduced ALPS that are just awfully grindy to battle. Due to the AOE super high initiative super high resistance roll killing sleep, they effectyively wipe your party in 5 turns, where you litterally cannot do anything. Alternatively you space your bros with one or two cell distance and you move them in a grid pattern. You have to chse them one by one and corner them on the map. All your 12 bros running after 1 ALP. While the others continue to move around. SUPER BORING. And the battle last for 40+ minutes if you have 6+ alps to battle (starting day 40-50 in my play throughs). Never experienced such a boring thing in a video game, is really really bad.   The rest is alright, noting too groundbreaking frankly. It adds fun the first 50 days. If you wanna  play through one or several crisis, the DLC will make your enjoyment lower. As many new enemies are boring as they scale in numbers not in tactics or strength.  DLC not recommended, base game is better.
1. All maps seeds have changed, map seeds are the life blood of the game for MANY people  2. Nerf's to all useable strong builds, now there is no "meta" builds, you are all "meat" and  everyone dies. We are back to the days of boosting health and running around naked. Joy.  3. You can no longer save scum new recruits, which when combined with point 2 basically makes the game unplayable. Save scum'n unique items has also been drastically nerf'd, DRASTICALLY. Meaning if you kept playing "post/end game" for the "loot hunt" now there is seriously no point. Twenty hours later one crap unique. Yeeeeaaah. The game is now only played by those who "try to survive to ____ day" and then bail. F*ck off.   4. New enemies which would be damn near impossible to kill with the OLD builds AND save scumming recruits are now a thing. Dying isn't enough, now watch as your sh*t troops kill EACH OTHER or sleep through being slowly murdered. Picture the necroservants/goblin shamens with their zero cooldown on enemies that spawn mass sleeps and charms. Good times. And the response from the dev's? Make them EVEN MORE difficult... Yep, got the message.  5. Saving the game and loading now takes literally 3-10x as long as it did before. Click "quick save" and pitch your tents. Loaded the game PRE DLC and tested, yes, it is still much faster. I don't know what they did but reported crashes and saving taking as much as 10x longer is now a "known issue". Congrats.  6. Changes to unique armor that allowed some characters to be almost "OP" are now basically worthless.  For example, it was a pain in the ass to get Davkuls set BEFORE (check out the thread on it) but getting it was WELL WORTH IT because the set was god tier- it now clearly isn't worth the effort to even go about getting it. They lowered its max durability, number of durability per turn repaired AND added more fatigue to the armor so that it screws with their new "nimble". Good work.  7. New enemies + new economy changes + more company deaths make the game EVEN SLOWER with even MORE random encounters that end with a party swipe GAME OVER, which was one of if not THE largest complaints with the game PRE DLC. We got the message.  8. RNG seems to be an even bigger issue than before (most likely bugs) with people reporting game logs reports that make zero sense- enemies hitting over 75% of the time, multiple battles, when they only have a chance to hit at 25%, etc. etc.  9. New retreating mechanics which somehow manage to add MORE RNG and slow the game down EVEN MORE, in a game that DRASTICALLY didn't need either. You now have to watch as your people move space at a time to the exit getting chased and killed along the way. The f*cking dumbest thing I have seen implemented in this game to date. Period.  TLDR: The DLC added very little new content while making the worst parts of the game somehow worse and f*cking completely the few things it had going for it, which isn't a surprise. The base game of Battle Brothers had SOME redeeming qualities DESPITE the dev's and their moderators not BECAUSE of. It is clear that they have a "vison" and anyone who wanted something else is not wanted, in the forums or playing their games. If you don't suscribe to the thought "losing is fun!", move along!  PS. I opened up the option for comments on this review, as I am banned (for, to this day, unexplanned reasons- I've asked and waited) it will allow me to vent some of my frustration by deleting all the comments I KNOW will be incoming from fan boi's DESPITE me telling them I will. They just can't help themselves.   PPS. Already had a half a dozen comments I have gotten to delete, first of all THANK YOU! Secondly, why make the comment? You know I'm going to delete them correct? Do you think I read them before deleting? If so, I hate to tell you that I don't...
Honestly, Great DLC.  Only issues is the balancing with the new monsters. Once they're redone then its an awesome DLC.
.... alps. lets make the game really slow and tedious, thats what people want! this is what people think is fun.... great job (slow clap)
I enjoyed the base game very much, and was pleased with an expansion.  However, this expansion somehow manages to make an enjoyable game dull. Buy the game, but not the expansion.
Could be a good game, instead it is a RNG fest where the biggest factor in winning is luck. There is almost no joy to be had in the tedious gameplay, it is difficult to upgrade your equipment, you often run at a loss, having to accept missions that wont pay for themselves, and its always the same few missions (deliver that, escort caravans, kill that monster). I feel that this game is big "♥♥♥♥ YOU" from the devs to the players.  The expansion adds more ridiculous difficult and unfair monsters to kill. If you enjoy pain and monotonous gameplay, this game is for you.
Don't buy it yet. The new enemies are terribly unbalanced and each fight against them will be either trivially easy and frustratingly impossible.  I fought 5 Alps in the early game, beating them easily as as could wake up my men each turn. I fought 5 Alps in the late game, and was destroyed as they managed to put all my mercs asleep in 2 turns, despite their high resolve. There's simply nothing I could do from that point. Game over.   They promised updates to tweak balance, let's see what happens.
New beasts are unbalanced and poorly tested...
Hexes and Alps break this otherwise good game.
Please Fix the crrashs during save game
Do not get this DLC, the new monster mechanics are unfun, effectivly one hit kills, or multi kills.  The retreat mechanic was changed to be less effective than manually moving to the border of the map.  Several perks were nerfed to uselessness.  To revert to the lindworm patch right click on Battlebrothers in the steam library, go to properties-> betas and select the 1.1.x "beta".
If you thought Geist/Fallen Hero/Necro horde or Necrosavant horde were OP, then this add-on is more of the same.  Save-scum "iron-man" is still in-place. If you don't like your last fight, just ALT-F4 out and try it again with different RNG. Good job developer, you nailed it...  Free "edge" retreat is now done on a turn-basis, so theoretically you can still lose men while retreating.  Iron-man still hangs for a second or two, which is pathetic for a game where you ender/leave town litterally tens of thousands of times per playthrough...  You are still forced to do the intro tutorial battle before you are allowed to see the map. If all the maps where fine, then no problem. As a vast majority of the maps are awful however...  The nice thing is the new late game content spawns on your pre-thirty day company, so you get to have your company wiped by things like an AOE Puncture spell or mind-control which has no counter.  I believe that the developer has taken their design insperation from the decline of the Darksouls series; when you cannot make intelligent and technically challenging content, make cheesy RNG content and the shitters will buy it anyway. We have your money, so fuck you, and fuck the game you loved.
Crashes every time
I played alot of cheap puzzle games. However this is one of the worst. Why would you create a puzzle with pieces that dont line up?
I really like jigsaw puzzles, and I love birds, so it should follow that I would love this game. However because of many issues related to this game, I was unable to enjoy it.   The first thing to note about this game is that there are 12 levels, the levels never get that difficult, the 12th level doesn't have that many pieces in it, nor is it that hard. The most difficult thing about the game tends to be that the pieces don't clearly align with each other, creating a very blocky view of the birds, it's very distracting, and adds one of the only difficulties in the game, which is actually more annoying than hard. The only other difficulty is that eventually the pieces get hard to distinguish between side pieces and middle pieces, added with the blockyness, makes it hard to tell what goes where.  It shouldn't take too long to get through all the levels, it took me about an hour. And I had to do the last puzzle 3 times, because it would not snap into place properly. It wasn't game breaking or anything, it just meant I couldn't unlock the achievement for it, but that doesn't matter because the achievements don't count to anything, as this game has restricted features. So the point of having achievements with birds on them is rendered useless. You can't enjoy the game for itself, nor can you enjoy it for the superficial achievements.  I have played many jigsaw puzzle games, and I can say that so far this is probably the worst one I have played. Everything good about jigsaw puzzles, it got wrong, there's no satisfaction, as the puzzles aren't hard. Seeing them come together is hard, because it's so blocky, there aren't that many puzzles, and there's not even a raven puzzle! The only leg up this game has over other jigsaw puzzle games is that the pieces snap together, instead of snapping into a grid. So you can work on stuff in the middle, instead of the old working on the side pieces first.  If you like looking at nice pictures of birds, don't buy this, you only get to see the nice picture in full size for a couple of seconds after completing the puzzle, other than that it's horrible and blocky. If you like jigsaw puzzles, don't buy this game, it doesn't do jigsaw puzzles well. If you want some easy achievements, don't buy this game, as the achievements count to nothing. Only buy this game if you want to play and complete an easy game, in one sitting, to add to the amount of games you've completed. It's not worth your money.   Just buy 'Pixel Puzzles 2: Birds' instead.
A $2 game... I get it...  But you can barely kill first encounters. If you rush right into next step you can get some gear to try and grind random encounters since the patrolling guys are too strong at first.  Then I make it past that, first boss does more damage than my max health.  Yes its a game for $2, it could be good, but enemies are just unmanageable to progress.
If you want to buy it for the Achievements then DONT BUY IT. Steam actually doesnt count the achievements somehow and you can`t use them in the Achievement showcase.   I had 11 games done and after I got all Achievements for it I still had 11 games done
Just simply awful. Seems like most Steam games are utter garbage, but this piece of trash is the worst. 0 stars.
I bought this DLC because I liked the original game, but a critical bug this DLC contains ruins all the fun. Causes might vary but the result is the same; you can't play any cards on your hand anymore. Your playable cards(which aren't actually playable at this point because of the bug) still glow but none of them can be clicked. All you can do is to  end your turn or surrender.  I think I have finished about 20% of the storyline, assuming that the length of this DLC's storyline is similar to the one of the original, and I have experienced the bug 4 times already.  Can't recommend it until it's fixed.
this game seems ready for mystery and unsettling spoiler it's not  killed 4 hours on this and it was okay buy this if you need some mindless unsettling weirdness otherwise pass I wish I passed
I'm kinda torn on leaving a Thumbs Down on this game. On one hand, I did have fun mindlessly playing it for about 2 hours. It does have a lot of charm with the kind of spooky dark vibes that you can see in the trailer, and progressing through the game feels satisfying... Up to a certain point.  Firstly, there NO ENDING to this game (just a screen and achievement similar to when you pass the first couple "levels"), which was extremely disheartening. I thought I'd be rewarded with some kind of lore for grinding through this game, but no. Just a 2.5 second screen, and then it's back to the game... Except at this point there's no real objective anymore.  The game is also filled with various glitches. Not only does it crash randomly sometimes, there are also glitches that effect the gameplay. Sometimes you'll find that you're not able to build various buildings - for absolutely no reason. If you close the game and open it back up, you MIGHT find that you're able to build it now. Randomly. No rhyme or reason to this.  Another glitch: When you complete your first main objective (I'm being vague intentionally here), your workers will retain their upgrades. If you close the game and open it back up, you'll have to upgrade them again. Not sure which part of this is a glitch, but I don't think they're supposed to stay upgraded tbh.  The game does have its charm and it's only $3 or less. Try it if you want despite the seemingly harsh review. I think I just had high hopes for this game because it looked so intriguing, so maybe I am being a bit critical overall. I would be willing to change my review if the dev fixed some of the problems I mentioned... First and foremost the lack of a real ending.  Anyway, if you want to get a better idea of how the game plays, and maybe laugh at my stupidity, check out [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwxT4WM0CXM]my video[/url] of the game. -- > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwxT4WM0CXM  
In it's current state I cannot recommend this game. It's got a huge amount of potential considering the skateboarding video game scene, but that's all it has. This seems like a demo of a bigger game, but isn't. Perhaps if the developers added more content, or an easier way to access more maps and modifications for the game it'd be worth it and i could return to the game, but in this state it hasn't got enough content. The way the game works and plays is really good, but there isn't enough area to view the games full potential.  4/10
Really good game but it's currently being kept "alive" by mods and the discrod community, devs aren't updating the game at all, there hasn't been an update that improved the game itself for about three months now, and there hasn't been a single major update yet.
Only one shoddy map and having to spend at least an hour sorting out mods to have something decent to play. Development team only posting videos of people pulling off tricks and haven't shown any progress in months. Very buggy & minimal content at best, as well as the gameplay being bad compared to Skating games of the past. Community is active and maps are available, but for the bugs, poor gameplay and lack of updates... Just get a 360 on the cheap and a copy of Skate 3. Really wanted this game to be something great but 6 months into early access and it's CURRENTLY a disappointment.
developers doing nothing but just posting videos about tricks!
20 dollar demo. Havent heard a single thing from the devs since i bought it. To top it all off it started to crash when i started it up every time, i see a million threads about it, and no fix or comment from the devs on any of them. Most people that had that seem to have given up and refunded. Wish i never bought this game.
£15 tech demo
no
glitchy and boring. worth $5 max in its current state
As of now, I can not reccomend it yet, even as early acces, even though there are modded maps, controlls feel weird, goofy doesn't work as it should and turning with L2 and R2 is akward. Turning with left joystick often turns into un unwanted nollie, turning with the left stick should be natural and playable. Optimal would be to have the same input like SKATE3 !!!  When switching from regular to goofy, turning left on the floor turns left, but in the air its reversed wich makes it impossible to play goofy since as soon as you land the direction gets reversed. We also need workshop! :-)
need mac version
Me and my brother were so excited to pick this up on the day of release. We have skated for years and now pushing our 40's. Work and all that physical jazz leads us more towards just cruising in a game with a few beers at the end of the night.  This has so much potential but these guys are just taking pisss with everyone  Sadly with Skater Xl you can't even spawn with a smoothness that sets you up with any form of a line or a bases.  You do get to pick a spawn point with up/down on the controller whilst you skate over your chosen spot. That feels clunky. This can lead to stance issues and your character rendered useless.  So you have found your line and then you have to deal with the lack of player configuration and shoddy physics.  No visual help integrated. Terrible framing issues. You may be running over 100fps but the game runs like the cat food Sheba.    This does not bring into account how terribly managed this project is  Even if you are hungry for another Skate wait to see how this gets worse :(  4/10   This is what I want the dev's to read....    For the love of god please write something about this project you have sold to people.  What do you do all day? How hard is it to write to people to let them know what is happening as of now?  Is there anything you have to show us? It feels like you don't care at all about your player base.  You sold this demo on Steam, people have paid money and want to join in with the idea of this game but you don't give a turd.
My game wont start , puts me in start menu and it dosnt respond to any controlls , i cant start the game , any help?
cool game, great concept, mine is glitchy as hell tho, tried playing it for about 25 min until i realized its really buggy, my skater would fall randomly at least 5-10 times before i was able to try actually skating and the tutorial page wouldnt work at all. sucks bc i was hyped to play this game.
I want my money back. Add more maps or make the modding system easier.I had the maps working then they stopped and I am getting a fucking headache trying to make them work. Fuck this game
feels like a long wait...need some official content...totally BOARD of mods...pun intended.
Graphics 7/10, Controls 1/10, Level Design 8/10. Desperately needs work on controls, the idea was great, execution... not so great.  Classic Skate 3 controls would have made this an instant classic and more appealing to skaters. While you can control what tricks you do, its not exact, you may try a tre flip and end up just doing a shuv-it front foot catch. Keep the classic right stick to flip, left to control direction.  The game has great potential but for the $28, you want a game that can do what it was designed to do.  PROS: Bright Graphics. Balanced Skate spots. Semi-realistic movement.  CONS: Poor Control layout. Ragdoll glitching happens often. Over priced for a poorly executed game. Unable to get off board to access certain areas. Developers wait for modding community to fix their game,  instead of doing it themselves.  Overall Score 5.3/10 
very dissapointed. i understand its in early access but the controls are trash and it hardly playable. every time i spawn back at my waypoint about 80% of the time it ragdolls 5-10 times.
Devs don't care about their game, with only one map and no recent updates, and never bothering to tell people in discord what they've been up to or answer questions. The players themselves have created maps that are fantastic, and if it weren't for them I would not at all recommend this game. While maps are limited to street skating (developer choice) it is worth a few hours of fun. Definitely worth below 10 dollars right now.
When i saw the unity logo on my task bar i was a little blown away. One of the first logos you see. I'm not to sure if that engine can produce the game I'm looking for with this team in a timely manner. Seems fans are taking it into there own hands to do anything with it. Its not that impressive when you see a community update and its just highlighting people that are playing the game with mods.  Maybe a fire will get lit or fans will take over and make a better game out of the scrap. This seems like an early access cash grab or ambitious ideas being executed poorly.
The game is just a prototype. Developer doesn't care about the Community. 3-4 minor (even less than minor) updates in the last 5 months. The only thing that keeps this "game" alive is the modding community as there was no new content yet released. Skin (from the ingame model) is bugged since Day 1. Fix takes 1 minute (and they know it, after the COMMUNITY told them), they still don't bother to release a quick hotfix, even tho their got a official video contest. They literally don't care about the Community.
huge skate 1,2,3 fan was highly ranked on s.k.a.t.e back in the day. i want to like this game but it just felt so slopy and odd to me. maybe i will rebuy it in the future but for now im about to do a request for a refund. its a demo right now. and my stance keeps getting all messed up and i gotta oli with my left stick. i saw the devs post they are working on  some stuf but for now im gonna gibe it a negative revirw. il be watching for updates and change my review when the game has improved. as for the mods im not intrested in downloading random files. get that steam workshop up or add some content.
It's a pile of water trash, 5 minutes of content for 20$... Will be forgotten about quickly since the devs don't seem to care about doing anything.
I like the game but the fact that they leave it to modders to add content is really weak.  These people want 20 dollars for a demo. It doesn't seem like they are  working to make this a legit game. Dont give them your money.
Its a fcking DEMO
This is to Skate as Wild West Online is to Read Dead Redemption.  It's a hard pass.
I want my money back game glitchs to much
Less then I thought I would get for 18$ I mean it has potential and it would be BIG if these guys finish it. But for now what you get is one Area to skate in to try out the controls, a glitch character who just goes rag doll randomly and a list of tricks to learn. I would have paid 4$ if I knew that is all I was getting. Would have been worth 18$ if there was a 1 level with like a handful of objectives. I would save your money until something more is released.
I bought Skater XL on sale for $15.99 and I'm not impressed with it for the price paid. $15.99, let alone the regular $19.99, is not a proper asking price for a tech demo, and Skater XL is looking like one of those games that are taking the premise of the early access market and stretching it way too thin. The base, unmodded game is still comprised of only one skater, one deck, one map, and a handful of flip tricks and grinds, and the developers appear to be near-completely reliant on the modding community to come up with content.  I'm not a skater, I'm a gamer. Regardless of what the skaters might say about how fluid and accurate the game feels to them, as a gamer, as of version 0.0.5 and nearly a half year into development, this game is not recommendable even for an enthusiastic $15.99 show of support. I threw in my own show of support, but I'm asking Steam for it back.  And for the game's defenders: no, Early Access doesn't have to mean, "nearly finished", but it doesn't necessarily mean "barely started prospectus demo", either, *especially* when it's $15.99 - on sale.
yes i do. but then again i dont. im beyond stoked to see where this game ends up! although this small area is not enough!!! build me some pools!!! i wanna vert!  update: man.... this is sick. maybe add some powerslides with the shoulder buttons?? update 2: no patches in sight, no word from dev team. great potential straight up lost. enjoy my money i guess...
I don't understand how this game has mostly positive reviews.Its nothing more than a tech demo of a roughly 50' by 50' lot to skate in. I'd wait for them to release actual content before paying anything.
you need a controller
$16 for what is basically a demo set in a seriously tiny map with not much to do at all, a few ledges and rails, no real ramps or vert and no customization at all? Hell no, go download the Session demo, it's free, plays basically the same and even with a smaller map it has twice if not three times as much to do. Yes this game has real potential but $16-20 is absurd for a game seemingly barely in development, especially when you can get more for less even free elsewhere. Save it and wait.
dont buy its unfinished
This is the first review i have ever wrote and don't get me wrong this game is fucking amazing, the controls are amazing and the graphics are too. However in its current state its not worth the money at all, the game is buggy as hell and has VERY little content. I am already bored with it.   This game has the potential to be something great, lets hope the devs do more with it...    
maybe this game can be cool but mine will only stay in the section where you have to press A to continue and i cant even skate! does anyone know how to fix this? thanks.
not done yet. I will recommended to wait till content appears. :) The game itself have high potential. But i totally miss the kickflip on same stick and spinning on stick not on a button... Sadly this game can't beat the Legend Game Series SKATE cause of 0 content. :/ Its crazy that a skateboard game have no story or multiplayer mode to play skate most points or whatever. In my eyes it's boring af with no competitive. I don't enjoy sandbox games and also the map is a joke for this game price.
This is not a game by any means - it's a raw skate simulator engine. It lags a lot, you can't walk, you fall pretty much whenever touch any obstacle etc. and there is only one map, no customisation whatsoever. Mods help quite a bit tho, but I think it's unfair to give this "game" any regards now, it's a lot of work for developers to do yet. I will however play it, just because there is no alternatives, and i'm already addicted to this type of gameplay. The physics and control basics are great, I like much more than skate series. Anyway, it's absurdly overpriced right now imo, and I'm afraid than devs will chill and never finish it.
Skip the hype train. While this looks to be a very promising title, it is still extremely early in it's development as a full game. In my opinion it is not worth the $20 price tag as it seems to be more of a tech demo than a game (in it's current state). On a different note, I owned the mobile game (just called skater) from this developer and to be quite honest they left a sour taste in my mouth. They stopped supporting the game very early and let bugs run the entire thing. It also lacked new content with no word on why they stopped rolling out updates. I'm very worried the same thing could happen to this game as they really haven't commented on that garbage fire of a development cycle and what they are going to do to change it. They did the same thing with that game, saying it's the next big thing, inviting pro skaters to try it and promote it, yadda yadda. I hope they prove me wrong but their track record doesn't help matters. All in all an impressive show as to what's possible in the world of extreme sports titles, but not something you should run out to buy as they haven't given us all they promise to give.
this game no longer runs for me, it just freezes and closes after pressing a to start
the worst money I waste on a game ever.... the developers dont interact woth the community,releasing only a few updates,now it makes me question myself if this game was worth it lol
The modding community is the backbone of this game the devs do little to make it more playable/ fun
THIS GAME COULD BE BETTER to be honest i think this game could be good but at the same time..It could be much more. for starters this game is good for the first six hours so when you are finished with all the game play it offers you look at the steam workshop like you would most other  games to get your moneys worth but that's when you realize that it does not support which made me mad. then i went onto youtube to see if there was a way to to chage up my clothes... there was but it was a long proses same to change the map. thats when i noticed i just wasted 20 dollars. dead line is that this game could be good if it was supported by steam workshop.
Not a game, not even a proper tech demo.  At current stage, it's somewhat amusing garbage.
Cant even get the game off the main screen. pressed every button on the key board and mouse still nothing wtf.  
As much as I love this game so far, I can't honestly recommend it until it gets further into development. And being probably one of the few people that runs the vanilla game and hasn't even touched mods, not even clothing. There hasn't been enough frequent updates and the ones that have have seemed to target the mod scene and hasn't really helped with their actual base game other than like one or two things. So until they push more stuff with the base game this will stay unrecommended, but I have enjoyed all the time I've spent on it.
This feels more like a demo then an actual game.
As the game stands I would not recommend the game. It's been out since December and the developers haven't done any major changes to the game, just minor bug fixes. I can see this game being worth $20 when its more polished. If you're really really itching for a skateboarding game with 1 small stage, this game is for you. Yes, there are modders that make levels, but that should also be on the developers to do so and not sit back and let others design their game.
Great, fun game with pretty good skating mechanics for a game. Definitely would not recommend this game until the developers get their shit together and make more content though, as playing in the same area gets extremely boring after 3 hours and the only thing making this game still fun at this point is the modding community.
Was soll ich sage  meiner Meinung nach hat das Spiel potential ABER alleine das reicht nicht ich kaufe ein Produkt für 20.- was viel zu Teuer ist wie ich finde. Es gibt keine Story, nur eine Map und das spiel funktioniert mal überhaupt nicht wenn man es mal ein Bischen anders spielt als gedacht. Im grossen und ganzen ist das spiel nur ein kurzes vergnügen das auch nur spass macht wenn man spiele wie Skate oder Steep mochte.
This game was meant for xbox and its available for computer? i know you can just hook up a controller to it but its hard to figure out the controls. 
not playable in its current state
INCOMPLETE
if you like the game skate don't buy this game it is really bad right now not even close to being finished and really its kinda painfull to play. controls are super inconsistent and bug out often wait for full game.
Great game but Devs are doing nothing
Bought this game in December. Came back in March and not a damn thing has changed. Game shouldn't even be available THIS early. Spent 20$ for an unplayable game. 3 month and they changed an angle and a knee bend....What a joke.....
great potential wasted by lazy development
Iv Seen My Fare Share of games come and go and i gotta say this dev group looks exactly like the ones that made nether rez. Very little info on them no twitter or social media for giving updates on the game or taking feedback from there community. putting out updates that arnt even updates for gameplay over the course of three months. I have a strong feeling there will be no game here ever, just a bad re-skined skate 1 with no grabs or game just a little demo to skate around in . And if you want you can trust in every mod maker and DL random files in hopes its something you can skate.....   These Devs need to start pulling up there socks and get this game out or i gottah say they need to refund people this is not a game it is a concept demo and a bad one at that .
steam early access was made to sell demos, now if people want to buy games that are not finished thats up to them, but god this is worst than project session and that game is free and runs off unreal engine 4 , and it feels like this game uses the same controls and physics. i would not recommend this go play project session for free. also i really dont see the devs finishing this game, maybe after its been on "early" access for five years it will be "finished" *cough* ARK *Cough*
You could pay $20 for this game now and enjoy it for what it is...Honestly it's a blast. But with 2 minor updates since release the modding community seems to be picking up all of the slack. Please don't contribute to this game until the devs prove they're not in it for a quick cash-grab, it's not fair to the game itself to let them line their pockets and dash away. This game is too good to be wasted on greed.
Its not really a Skate 3 contender which is a shame because I was really looking forward to seeing this one in action! Very little content since release and mostly supported by mods these days, I honestly lost interest in about five minutes and the overall controls (Xbox One controller) are just awful. All we want is a skating game with the "flick it" system, a few different camera angles and a bigger map. Also, what's up with skaters legs being so bowed all the time, skating is about fluidity and these guys just look like they are holding in a poo while trying to skate!? It's missing things like basic grab tricks and honestly would it hurt to put a half pipe in an empty map so we can experiment?  Overall, pretty frustrated by this as I'm so eager to relive my skate days. 6/10  It's really not worth the price.
why i cant play this game ?
Quite buggy, and is basically a very small demo for the price. If it was considerably cheaper then it would be no issue, but for such an expensive demo it is quite silly. There is only one small map, and about 10 tricks that you can do, not counting the mods that players have made. The mods make this game better, but the developers do not update it enough for an expensive price. The Controls can be confusing, and the game gets boring after about 30 mins of skating the same small area, with a bunch of bugs. Might become good in the future, but the rate at which the devs are updating it, it might be far in the future.
This might be good in time, but right now I'm not a big fan of the controls, the single level, and the animations. It just wasn't a very enjoyable experience for me. You might like it, but I don't.
Garabage and scam. it's ambitious how they are trying the controls and physics but even if they could get it to work smoothly its not fun feeling very crappy buggy boring cheap awful not even music? i mean seriously might as well trash this "project" it will take at least 5 years to polish these buggy physics and controls and even then its extremely annoying and tedious and turning with triggers? why? awful dissapointment. if you are a fan of the skate games this is not your answer. DO not buy this scam they are selling because it will never be completed. trash it  
This game is literally unplayable, don't waste your money on it. It does not support gamepads but doesn't support Keyboard and Mouse either. I have no idea what you should use to control your skater, a fucking trackball? A steering wheel? I mean, I can push and I can turn, but that's it. While the analog sticks work in the tutorial menu, they don't when I want to do tricks. And it's no fancy shit, just a basic XBox 360 ganepad.  Worst game on Steam I've ever paid money for, 0/5 would not recommend.
says press a cant get past sreen with laptop keyboard. do i rely need controller 
DO NOT BUT THIS GAME..now atleast, the only content we have gotten is from the modders and its amazing but it is a pain in the ass to mess around with the files everytime you want to play. I would wait a little bit til the devs actually release something themselves... if they ever do..
Devs seem to be relying heavily on modders.  Worried they are going to abandon ship since they got their loot.  Have extremely high hopes for this game still but am slowly getting more and more worried as time goes on.  If you are lookin for a neat tech ALPHA then check it out.  I personally wish I waited a few months before buying this.
At this current time for the current price I can't recommend this game. As a massive fan of the sport I've been waiting patiently for a skateboarding game that takes a more realistic approach. This game could provide that with a bit of TLC, and I will change my recommendation if it improves.  Cons:  - It feels as if you're skating through sand, after one trick you'll find yourself pushing again. - There's one tiny stock map, the modding community provides a ton more, but they are mixed in terms of quality. - Trick access feels limited. Basically it's all kickflip, and heelflip variations, but nothing past that point. - Grinds and slides are awkward at best. Most of the time you'll find yourself magically locking onto a ledge when you're trucks are no where near the edge   Pros:  - Modding community has a TON of free additional content - Tricks are somewhat realistic and very satisfying. - The one foot catch is a nice addition, even if it's a bit buggy.
4/10
After the update my game with mods didn't work anymore, it crashes after I press 'A'. Even after reinstalling it, it still does not work. Please fix this issue very fast.
Fun game once you become familiar with the controls. Closer to an actual skateboarding sim when compared to Skate 3. But VERY buggy. Simply not enough content for $20 in my opinion. Dev's just released a update after a few months that added no real playable content or major bug fixes. They added some textures and made some slight modifications to the player model animation.... Why not add mod support or another map? Why not fix major issues like the absolutely broken collision detection?  Players don't care if a painted concrete wall has a few more dirt marks and scratches(update 0.0.3)... We want more playable content and major bug fixes.  I understand this game is early access, but simply can not recommend it at its current $20 price. I really hope the dev's step up and release a major update because this game has a lot of potential!
20$ unpolished demo  I can't recommend a game in this state with a 20$ tag.   First, the controls and the attention to detail are great.. but that's it. There is no start menu aside from a "Press A to start". There are no settings aside from basic visuals. skating switch is nothing but a buggy mess. There is only one map. The board mechanics are awkward so you can't actually tell what trick you just did *most of the time*. The game doesn't tell you what trick you just did which leads me to believe the game doesn't actually know. The devs take months to release a very small update.   That being said.. mods are keeping this game alive. You can download boards, parks, even menus for this game thanks to the modding community. Sooooooooo do that.
Yo can i get a refund this game will not run on my computer thanks for robbing me
 so your telling me, they relased a PC gmae that requires an xbox or ps controller? just stick to console.
gonna be great if the devs aren't lazy scammers!
Cannot get past the press A screen, using a generic PC/PS4 controller (which I know works) impossible bypass the screen with keyboard either. Absolutely unacceptable, the game has been out this long and they still can't fix this. Looks like very little communication from the dev team as well. Do not spend anything on this until more real content or updates are released.  Maybe it only works with an XBox controller, I don't know. This is a PC game you should have figured these issues out by now.
not really a fan this game is boring and it should add multiplayer and missions for the campaine i played it for 5 minutes and uninstalled
Crashes at startup since the release. No updates or patches from the developers. Probably the only thing that keeps this game and the devs alive is the community.
The game has potential... But the devs seems to have dropped the project. Nothing new for a while, and there is literally nothing in the game yet. Just a single (very, VERY small) map with barely anything to do in it... The devs are super quiet, I even had issues with launching the game, posted messages on the forum... no news from the devs...  The game looks promising, but the development team is garbage... Thats too bad, I had hopes for this.
no update since forever......
No roadmap from a game that stole a controller scheme. Makes me think they stole my money too, with all the silence from the devs
This is not a game, the only way to make it playable is with mods. The "Devs" of the "Game" are making the money even though it's the community doing everything with mods to make it enjoyable.
it probobly is a scam 
For now do not buy this game. The only thing that is backing this game right now is the modding community which they have done an excellent job with the skateparks and even more. But as people have said it looks like this was more of a college cash grab for a couple of guys that put together something in unity and they havent even attempted to try and communicate with us. Buy with your own caution.
[h1]In short: DO NOT buy this game unless you don’t mind the lackluster content and updates[/h1]  [h1]Development[/h1] Easy Day Studios, the developer of this game, has no official website or social media. The last patch Skater XL got was in December of 2018, the only message we got from the developer was previous month. These are huge red flags we can’t ignore.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] The skateboarding mechanics in this game are amazing, but still not fully fleshed out. Movement feels fluid and the animations really compliment the tricks that the player is able to perform. However, there are still many bugs that need to be fixed in order to turn it into a solid experience. There are also mechanics missing like skating on ramps or getting off your skateboard.  [h1]Content[/h1] Skater XL has currently only one map. It’s not possible to customize your character or modify the map in any way.  [h1]Mods[/h1] There is an active modding community on [url=https://discord.gg/AfWruQY]Discord[/url]. Many people claim that the mods are selling the game, but I have to disagree. I have tried more than 10 community made maps and sadly none of them compare to the base map that comes with the game. Maps are either too cluttered or have the wrong scale, which in turn makes skateboarding feel way less satisfying. Many maps also feature ramps while there are still no solid ramp mechanics built into the game, this makes for a very buggy experience that ruins the maps that contain them.  [h1]Verdict[/h1] For die-hard skateboarding game fans it is probably worth the money because of the great core gameplay. Sadly it’s not worth a buy for most people because of the lackluster content and development cycle.  10-2-2019 update: The developers have made an update on the current state of Easy Day Studios, it seems like they are more busy growing their company than working on the game. A small update has been added to the game which fixed two bugs and added minor visual changes to the map. The update seems to have broken the game for some players.
Since the game is still in development there is still a lot to get done. I feel that Skater XL have a lot of potential, if guided by their true supporters and early access companions.   For now, i do not think the buy is worth it, not at this state.  When full released, I'll check it out again and definitely see if this game and its developers achieved their goal.
you guys didn't really change the game too much since launch. what's going on? I bought your game since day 1 so i can support you guys & see UPDATES as i play the game. we got Puddles, bushes, dirt marks& a goofy ollie bug fix. c'mon devs.. very disappointed. Fire your current employees& hire the modders (joke). Your current plan isn't working too well if you guys are putting out very Minor updates every couple months. i'll continue to support you guys till the end because this is the best Skate Sim out there atm :). but maaan..game is starting to get very stale after 70 hours in courthouse
Screw these devs. I love this game and its mechanics but these devs are scammers. I hope everyone realizes this. Read the steam discussions before you buy. It's a tech demo with no communication for months and no website or social media to contact Easy Day Studios.  No Roadmap, one single level with a few grinds and flips.  Sorry. No.
you get about 6 hours of game play and they don't update they game at all, don't buy.  After a few updates the game biggest issues are still here, they are becoming lazy because the modders are doing everything.
this game is a dumpster fire and you shouldn't buy it. I feel bad for every one who can't refund the game anymore. the only good part is that the player dies as soon as he touches any thing and the lides away. best unity game i've played! 0/10 would not ign.
pretty lame game. pales in comparison to skate 2
Its been more than a month, and they havent done anything. I get good games need time, but the modding community is doing more work than them. That says alot. I want multiplayer and I want workshop maps. NOW. 
Huge lack of updates and content. RIP Have fun at the beach while it lasts.
Its kind of a huge mess right now, i do have hope that the devs will update/ fix all the graphical, audio, and gameplay issues. the main things that I dislike are : no higher up camera angle , the support / remapping for controllers are horrible, lack of character/ board customization, and finally so little actual content . Modders are really  the ones developing the game at the moment, seeing as the game is only in early access. I really hope that Easy Day makes a wonderful skating game , but we just don't know at this point.
unplayable game
I don't get why people are praising this game so much. It's so barebone that I can hardly even call it a "game". The controls are VERY unintuitive, and there is literally no content. Also seems to run poorly on a powerful system.. a good example of bad optimisation.  Stay away for now. Charging 20 bucks for this is shady.. I might come back again after the devs do some refining.
HEY Idk whats up with my skater XL but i downloaded it and i will got to the menu and press A and my controller and it load it and then i freeze my laptop so im not happy camper
i really enjoyed the skater app on mobile (seriously, i put hundreds of hours into it as my go to time waster), but this just isnt there yet. it is fun to dick around, but there is no substance yet.   if you are on the fence, hold off for now.   i'll be back for this when its further along in development.
Fuck this piece of shit, you are better off running in traffic.
The game looked a lot of fun until I actually played it and realized it's nothing like it seems.
Reallyyy want to play this game bad. It looks so awesome  but I cant get past the "press A" screen. I have even posted and made comments in forums but get no replies.. I tried everything I've read on other posts with problems but nothing seems to work. I am refunding now
looks like a promosing game but still has a long way to go which is why i cant reccomend buying this as it is now in early access maby when there is more content and if they can get the controls right something more like the skate games from ea games would be good atm the controlls are horrible imo there no menu as far as i can tell to customise control layout or anything
Trusted the overwhelming positive reviews. And well, after spending about 30 minutes learning the ropes, I got around to doing the tricks I was going for. Early access? more like a demo. Buggy reactions, lack of reverts, no pause menu, no trick indicator, can't get off your board, you can only skate what's in front of you. You open the game and it drops you straight into one single small map, yes it's a famous skate spot, but its small and It's all you got. No skater profile, and you start off in Regular Stance.. I'm goofy footed. I will fall off my board pushing too close to a wall, but when I can go full speed into a ledge grind and ride off into a tree and not fall... I love the idea and the physics of the game, It's rewarding to land the trick you called, but the overwhelming bugs and lack of conent makes me REGRET buying A DEMO for TWENTY DOLLARS. I even went out to buy a xbox one controller just to play this game. $40 bucks in and i'm extremely dissapointed. Too much hype for litle outcome. This "early access" is not worth buying YET. I have hopes, but for now please buy a copy of Skate 3 and you will find yourself logging in hours skating lines and different locations with unlimited trick possibilities.
This is more of a playable demo than even early access.   I love the idea and want to see it become something complete, but for now I have to say I can't recommend it.  Hopefully they don't give up on it and it becomes better.
My first ever review on Steam. From a price-per-hour of playtime perspective, there are better ways to spend your money. For example, a used copy of Skate 3 for your old Playstation would be a much better idea.  This to me is a working prototype and not early access.   Summary: Probably the worst money I've ever spent on a video game, and I trusted the "Very Positive" reviews so had to write this.  Animation: This is Tony Hawk with better impacts and more board independence. Foot positions switch instantaneously with no motion tweening. There is no sense of speed apart from a weak attempt at simulating it with motion blur on the camera. Motion blur on the user camera? How is that a good idea?  Falls: The ragdoll impact physics leave much to be desired with the character making some very unnatural falls.  Controls: The controls are arcade. Not as "arcade" as Tony Hawk, but they are not satisfying. You don't "feel" the ollies. Having different control schema for a high and medium ollie is also counterintuitive to me, it should be based on analogue accelleration and not an adding the second stick.  Map: A "Pixel Perfect" representation of this legendary skate spot is marketing jargon, do not fall for it. There are no environmental effects, nothing beautiful, no rays of sunshine, no shimmering surfaces. Perhaps that's too much to ask for early access, so lets at leaset get some realistic textures. Textures are flat and colors are too uniform to be true to life.  This is not worth your money, the large number of positive reviews are from Berrics fanboys or fans of the genre, not dgamers. Early access should be done like Rust did it, like Subnautica did it, like The Forest did it, like Session is doing it through Kickstarter. The Steam platform is not Kickstarter, but it seems to be the way this was launched. I fear this early access was rushed out to get word out and pay some bills before Session demolishes this title.
Im going to wait till its more fleshed out. This seems like it could have been a free demo. 
I cant even get pass the main screen. Yet another waste of $20
I REALLY want to love this game, but its so incredibly awkward I cant even do it.   
I was stoked because of this game. Ive seen people doing some live reviews on this. And then i bought it today. But suddenly it wont work into my laptop. Is there any way to make tgis one happen on my computer??
this seems like it will be cool someday when someone adds a game to it. at this moment it is a pretty nice sim of me skateboarding, ie you fall down a lot, get frustrated, and quit mostly because there is no reason for you to keep doing it.
Horrible fucking game its a skate 3 copy and when you press escape the game quits.... small play area and noting to do.
Finally Easy Day Studios releases us from waiting for a new skateboarding-game that is actually fun! It looks nice already and the total board control works pretty good also. Compared to the Tony Hawk-Series it has a way more realistic stance. Whilst Tony Hawk felt more like a skateboard-based Jump and Run this actually feels like skateboarding. Awesome! Can't wait for new content!  Edit: It's been almost 4 months ago i wrote this review and nothing has changed. They did some minor fixes to calm down the community but i dont really see progress. There should be some new skateable areas real soon and especially SOMETHING TO DO. There are no challenges, highscores or whatsoever. Come on devs, stop smoking cali-weed in your fancy new long beach studio and get your asses up and actually work on this game.   However, i can't recommend this until i know where this game is headding (if anywhere), so i changed the recommendation status at least for now.
Wow I would have had more satisfaction watching a 20 dollar bill burn in a fire.  These controls are terrible.  Why is this 20 dollars?
essentially a tech demo. maybe they will add more to it at some point, but it's currently not worth the asking price.
This is barely a vertical slice. It's a dev test map that resets anytime you ragdoll. The controls feel rather twitchy and make it very easy to ollie when you want to turn resulting in resetting again to the same start point. I really want this to be a thing but I feel like they jumped the gun on putting this in early access. There is very little to enjoy and I wouldn't buy it in it's current state.
Almost one month passed after this game was released and devs still can't fix controller issues that everyone's experiencing, but they're promised to fix that problem at December 19, today is 8 January and still nothing. Devs doesn't even show up in the discussion threads to inform people about any upcoming updates and fixes. I don't know what to think, this game seems like great project that can help bring skate games back to life on PC segment since Project: Session was abandoned by the devs, and now it seems like this one will be forgotten too, but i still hope this will be a great game with workshop support and MP when it will be out of alpha. But still, i do not recommend to buy this game at this moment.  UPD: 2 feb. 2019. Still no update. I'm a little sad that I missed my refund time frame. Unsupported and abandoned. No hope left.
in thise stage of the game i think its a nightmare. The controls are extremely janky and awkward and you can fall on anything. People are saying that there is very few glitches and thats not true. there are tons of hilarious glitches in this game that are very easy to trigger. I don't reccomend playing this game any time soon. but i do have some high hopes for the dev team and i hope this game evolves nicely
nice game, but atm no content, updates and no support / communication from the devs!  edit:  please report this company, this product is a scam!
Payed money for the game and can't even start it. It won't even get past the title screen. I can just hear me popping tricks while staring at the screen. If anyone knows a solution that would be great
this game has potential but as it stands right now it's barely a game. Its 1 very small map. No customization, no points for doing tricks. Tons of tricks are missing, such as grabs, stalls and many different types of grinds. No replay features, no ability get get off your board and walk up some steps leading to some very annoying instances of trying to setup a line.  It has a nice flow to the "game" (not quite as fluid as EA skate though) but there is just so much missing that i can't even stomach playing this for any longer than I have. 20 bucks can be better spent on a actual game rather than an Idea.
Have trried all sorts of things with my PS3 controller.. I can see it but the game wont let me play. what a dissapointment and waste of money.... back to Skate 3 on my WORKING playstation....
I dont think this game should even be in a beta its still so broken I found myself falling by just trying to turn around and i bumpped something maybe when the game is finished ill think about getting it.
Let me preface this by saying that I've played the Skate franchise to death with my friends over the past couple of years. If I would've spent all that time skating for real I probably would be winning Street League by now, but such is life.  Anyway, I got this game after looking at some videos and reviews. It looked great on the surface, but the game in its current state is very disappointing. I know it's early access, but even for early access this game is missing a lot of stuff and I feel like it's going to take probably at least another year, if not more, for it to be where it should be.   The game doesn't have an in-game menu, falling off your board resets you to a marker instead of continuing from where you fell, the controls feel a bit unpolished. It's a nice tech demo, but that's basically it: a very limited demo and not worth nearly 17 euros at this point.
Its amazing, legit amazing, more realistic than EA's Skate games. Every kickflip I did was different in some way.  [b][u]BUT[/u][/b] and this is the big issue. Its £15 for basically a demo. For the price alone, I cannot recommend this game.
This game should have the Skate 2 and 3 mechanics instead of the left analog stick for the left foot and the right analog for the right foot. Also, you should be able to get off your board so you can set up a good angle at rails. Too sloppy for the price.
Don't pick this up. This is a tech demo at best, basically no content, no updates.  The devs released a proof of concept and have abandoned the game. Mark my words, this is just another early access waste of time / money. Go play Skate again, you won't regret it.  The only reason I have so many hours playtime is because of the modding scene, which I'm also burnt out on.  Devs thought the best allocation of their funds would be to buy/rent a fancy office in the heart of the skateboarding scene lol.  Also as far as I can tell, the controls are basically 1 for 1 lifted from session, I look forward to seeing if any lawsuits come from that.  These guys have no idea.
20? Seriously? Get real. Early Access or not, as of now this is probably one of the more boring games I've played since the day I built my pc. I would wait until the devs roll out some serious content before you buy it. Mechanics & controls are good. Graphics are good. But there's virtually zero content so far & the base map they have is incredibly dull/small, regardless of it being a real world location. They really should've waited awhile longer before releasing it into Early Access. It has the potential to be the skating game we've been wanting for a long time, but right now it's just an empty game. Follow the game & keep your eye out for updates, as I recommend it once they give players something to do besides skate circles around a map that has nothing in it. It'll be a LONG time before I'd say it's worth $20. As of now the price is just ridiculous.
who the fuck made the controls for this game, straight irritating
This games current state is a glorafide demo nothing more what you see in the video is prity much it,The game is good enough to keep you playing it for two hours,its fun thoe it is a great game board responds nice whould be a 10/10 if there was more to skate WARNING THIS GAME IS A $30 DEMO the devs need to add more content then what there is you get one board one of every thing yes its easy to mod boards and cloths but come on for $30 price tag there better be more content comen soon
Do you remember free demo of Session? Well, it's pretty much similar. But costs 20$. What else? No music at all. No pause menu, no options (at all), a lot of bugs (most of those are exactly the same as in Session!), no customization, small map (like really small), no time of day change (even free Session demo had this). There's even a default Unity window at the start. Guys I do hope that you WILL create something good out of this. Otherwise I could just burn my money with the same use. I will not request a refund as there's not so much skating games on PC and I would really like to see a good one. So, just put the money we gave to you to a good use.
the gameplay is okay, but the map is way too small right now. I'd say wait a few months then buy it, or wait for Project session
Game is not even ready for Early Access, looks like they used some stock assets for the skater, the horrible animations draw a lot of atmosphere out of the game, I found the controls and fluidity of the skate system not very good as well, turning when I shouldnt be, controls felt very hit and miss, sometimes the same inputs would perform different tricks.  The level it shipped with is super small and doesn't offer many skate spots to perform tricks.  UI is nonexistant, this loooks like the developers JUST made the game and the first working version was exported from unity without even an ingame settings menu and tossed up on steam. This is not early access it's the first alpha prototype.  Don't buy the game expecting anything other than sadness, maybe one day it will be ready to be played, right now you're better off waiting.
I'll update as more content comes out, but this is really promising.  edit (3/15/19):  So it's been over a month since we've heard anything from the devs.  I'm not expecting the world in a month's time here, but the lack of communication at this point is the main reason I'm changing my review.  Nothing of value has been added to this game by the devs since release barring some extremely minor updates(the vert one for example you could argue isn't even a fix), and their communication has been among the worst I've seen out of an early access game that had pretty strong initial interest.  The insane maps and additions unpaid modders are making in the same time that the devs are telling us nothing is borderline inexcusable, I can point to 2 map makers alone that have put out half a dozen quality maps for free, yet the devs can't even get us mod support to easily install.    I'd be happy to change my review back to positive, but for the time being, there is absolutely no way I can recommend this game to the average gamer.
i bought this game along with a xbox 360 windows compatable controller just to find out the controller wont work with this game, i even tried it with other games to see if it was the controller. buy no the controller works fine just not with the game. so yeah wasted money. i mean you'd think making a game that requires a controller you'd make the controllers compatable with computers work for the game but nope.
devs would rather let the community do everything for them. instead of making actual new maps or mechanics they add puddles onto the one level in the game.
Why i cant play this game on pc without controller wtf? 
Doesnt even work. Keeps crashing
This game sadly disappointed me.. It's just too much of a mess and there wasn't even a start or.. any guide.. i couldn't select any tutorials... it just disappointed me
The ideas and controls for this game are next level. The only thing I didn't like is that whenever you run into something with your shins - even the slightest, you fall down and respawn at the same point over and over.  I purchased because of the reviews and had countless hours on skate 1/2/3, but in it's current state with the lacking content - I cannot recommend for the price of $20. I refunded, but will be looking forward to the full release sometime in the future
shit game
I dig the controls. i dont dig the one single area the EA gives you at the moment. doesnt even feel like a skate park
the game controls are clunky, barely playable don't buy, not worth the price, had more fun with a mobile game  2/10 has potenial, don't buy yet, wait for the game to be fully released
This is just a tech demo, theres no menus, very basic tutorials, and a very buggy gameplay. I could be a very awesome game but it feels like they spent less than a year working on it even though its really been a few years. The flip and catch mechanic seems to be the only thing they worked on. Grinds and slides sometimes dont look right, and riding switch the controls are backwards. You end up pushing the thumbstick up even though you should be pushing it down. You can get used to that but that doesnt seem to make sense to push up on the thumbstick for a trick popping off the tail. An early access game thats been in devolopment for several years should definitely have more content in their game. Atleast a menu to exit the game. Theres not even that.
Very clunky controls. Feels like I'm playing a potato simulator.
I have played more hours of THPS and Skate than most and I can't say I enjoyed this very much. Although I like the concept of it being more "realistic" and more detailed with the control scheme I feel like it's overbearing and hard to find fun.  Some of my favorite tricks like bluntslides are impossible and other near impossible tricks (540 double flips) are super easy to perform.  It's not a good balance.  Almost everything looks like canned and robotic animations when performed and there's no feedback on what trick you just performed.  Grinds are inconsistent and super unnatural and weird looking and sometimes your character just dies for no reason.  I can see this eventually all being rectified, but I'm requesting a refund because this does't even qualify as Early Release material.  Its an alpha at best.
I've played free tech demos with more content.   That being said, I am really enjoying learning the physics to this game, trying to make a line better and better. This is coming from someone who loves THPS and has never played a skate game.  That being said this game in it's current state is not worth $20, it's not worth $10, It isn't even worth $5. Should you get it now?   If you enjoy skating games yes If not, no.    Update:  Bought in december, is now April and still there have been no major changes or updates
this game has way too little content for the price of it i had more fun on the 1 dollar mobile version of this game than the full thing. i have almost no time n this game and i feel like ive experienced everything this game has to offer this game has potential but right now there is almost nothing to do. wait until there is more content in this then buy it
somehow stuck in a goofy stance, can't get back to regular stance.. now all the controls are flipped.....sick af
Do **NOT** buy this game. Don't get me wrong, this game actually has very nice mechanics and moves very smoothly. The grinding feature, when on rails and edges, is actually better and more realistic than any other skating game i've played. With that said, all of the tricks take about 30 minutes, at most, to learn, and the map is extremely small. There is very little to do, and frankly, if I wasn't streaming the game the entire time, I would not have even played for an hour.   Usually, you'd think that 2 hours of game play is not nearly enough to describe an entire game, but in the case of this one, 2 hours is literally the entire game. There's maybe 5 rails total, a few edges, some stairs, and 1 small ramp. Maybe this would be worth $5, at most, but $20??? For a game that is basically a skating test-build?  I think that this game has a lot of potential. With that said, I think the only person that should buy this game is someone who is a huge fan of skating games and would only be buying this to support the developers. The game has a lot of potential, and I would imagine the only reason why this is released is to get funding, but really, they would have been a lot better off on a site like kickstarter.
This Game has plenty of potential but unfortunately this is in way too much of an unfinished state to be released to the public. I've been bitten by early access before so am requesting a refund on this one. Simply nowhere near enough content to be asking this price tag.
not worth the price in its current state. I don't find the controls intuitive at all. Must use a controller and controls aren't very good and cannot be modified. If you happen to touch anything you will fall.   Maybe as the game is updated more it might become a good game but it still has a looonng way to go.
This review was positive. No update for a month now. Instead they are doing a competition partnered with the nine club, that's cool on the surface, but the game is in absolutely no fucking state for this. Also the developers them selves will be reviewing it, why would they be wasting time on that instead of updating the game? Maybe they want to "build" the community and "connect" with its members more, but you'd be able to do that by fixing the game and adding content. Over a month now, no update. A contest... I just can't recommend anybody buy an early access game that isn't being updated with some frequency. For anybody that recommends this game because of the people modding it, you've missed the point entirely, and if the devs thinks its okay to not update the game because of modders, then you basically ran away with money. Ignore the cultists that praise this game in it's current condition, they just want another skate 3.
Before I start: Yes, I know this is Early Access. Yes, I understnad that they will be adding a ton of content later.  Right now this feels more like a demo than an early access game. There is only one park, no goals, nothing to work towards. You just sit in this empty park. Unless if you like skating games for the actual skateboarding itself and not other content like levelling or more parks, then its not worth it.  It will probably be worth the $20 in the future, but right now it gets boring after around 10 minutes.  Otherwise, mechanics and controls feel great, animations and graphics look beautiful (If you are on ultra, every other setting looks like minecraft on very low), and the core game is there.  This game definetly has potential but needs to reach that potential until they get my $20 again.  
for £15 that's early access you expect a little more than just a small map and tutorials on tricks. You're essentially paying for a demo. Like most early access games, this doesn't have any hope currently.  Do not purchase this game until more things have been added and devs have commented.
Spineless cash grab...How does this have positive reviews? This is barely a playable demo, anyone looking for a replacement for skate 3 keep looking.
I actually changed my entire review from "recommend" to "hold off". After putting about 30 hours into it, I've found nothing more than a tech demo. One map, fliptricks, grinds, and manuals. No grabs, no reverts, no getting off your board.  There's a really big modding community behind this game already, which is a plus! But you can have as many modded maps, clothes and decks as you want, the core game needs updates. Not even an option menu at the moment, only a tutorial screen.  I'd say watch the progress of the game over the next couple weeks/months until purchase. But Session is gearing up for Early Access soon too soo....
Well i gotta base my review off of the price sadly. You are pretty much paying full price for a demo, and i couldn't really even call this early access. Though the idea and game mechanics are really cool and, I'm really excited to see where this games goes from here. i know they need money to get it going, but this "demo" isn't worth $20 unless you wanna throw money into another one of these early access games. So its a no for me for now.
This game barely works and is a demo at most.  Not worth $20 at the moment.
It's definitely not worth the price tag, and I don't see it beating out Session, as much as I loved the Skater app, this just feels clunky and bare.  It's a tech demo, which was cool to try, but I don't feel like it's worth it until at least a beta is released.   I feel like I will one day recommend this game, but right now, honestly, save your money.
FRUSTRATED and upset game wont start and i feel like they took money from me all i got was a loading  screen then game crashes 90% of the time
it is pretty responsive but the turning with triggers is dumb as hell and makes it way to difficult to steer
Warning!  do not buy, it is nothing more than a very small area tech demo, no missions, story or adventuring.
This should be free right now to play . There is no content  even for being a new game we need content for are money . i was done with it in under 30 min . i will rebuy maybe when they add things to the game but this is dry . this will be a good game in time . i will rebuy but money for what you are selling no thanks  . thanks for steam being so supportive with this topic.
The graphics are good. Having skate for 10 years and also played other skate games, the only complaint I have are the controls. They are over complicated when you are trying different grinds. I seriously hope this game doesn't flop. I wouldn't spend the $20 again though.
I have a strong feeling session will be the champion of skating games going forward... Both games are very rough around the edges right now, but i feel like even the first session demo was much better than this. Its alright, but save your money... not at all worth 20 bucks...
this game doesn't fully support controllers as advertised and isn't worth $20 in its current state
if you are a fan of skate EVENTUALLY assuming they continue development then this game will probably be really fun.  Right now though its just not worth the asking price.  All you can do is roam around a small boring single map and do kick style tricks and basic grinds.  There are no grabs yet or a combo system or scoring etc.  So for RIGHT NOW i cant recommend you buy it but i would follow it close as they will raise the price as things get added so if you can buy it at this price AFTER they add more tricks, tighten some things up, add menus, fix controller problems, crashing and plenty other issues then do so.  This is the kind of game that shows massive potential BUT it is also one of those games that could be adandoned at any moment.  As of right now this wouldnt be considered to be enough of a tech demo if you worked AAA and were trying to pitch them the game.  Thats why i suggest waiting a little longer but also buying in before the price goes up.  Im going to return it for now simply out of fear that development will stop before the game gets to a point where its worth the asking price.  I hope im wrong and i hope to buy this again in a few months and see something fantastic.
If you're looking to get an experience similar to that of the skate games, you're in the wrong place.  Only played for like 15 minutes, worse than expected.  Might be good one day, but will never live up to the legend of the skate franchise.
Small map... not many tricks. If you think you are in for a skate 3 type of game you are wrong. This is a typical demo game and is not worth 20$
NOT ENOUGH MAP SPACE 
Not a game, but a short demo that really needs some work before it can be sold as a product.  Hold off on this one for a while :)
not sure how this is over $10 in its current state  im sure one day it will get better but for now its just not good enough  
Let's be clear from the get go. This is NOT a game. This is a protoype trying to evolve on the  Skate formula. If you see the price tag as an investement toward building a new Skate game with new control schemes and you are a skater or trully enjoy skateboard games, i can recommend it. But if you expect a certain amount of content as any early access game should have, you'll be disappointed.  The first aparrent thing that comes to mind is the different control scheme. It is still heavily grounded into the physics based gameplay Skate got us used to, but with a difference. Each joystick controls each foots independantly. You have to unlearn your old habits from Skate 3 but after an hour or two, you start understanding the subtlelty of it. By positionning your foots independantly, you can manage the way you balance your weight on the board. Which means that you can even choose the way you press a crooked grind on the ledge for example. It still needs a bit of work but the base controls are promising.   It isn't perfect tho. The total lack of vert mean that we still can't grab and no 540 over the ramp. Grinding can still feel a bit off, like if your trucks were made of soap. Manual are a bit stiffed too and doesn't translate well the search of balance a manual would impose There are also isolated but still problematic issues with certain controllers, especially PS4's with dead-zone triggering unwanted shove it while arming an ollie. Also no walk mode.  Let's talk about the map. This is where the game gets a giant no-no from me. It is ridiculously small, and i mean like half the size of the first Skate 1 demo! Any skateboard games lives and die on its level design. Skater XL in their quest to realism decided to recreate real places up to scale. Great idea on paper, terrible in practice. Gameplay should always come first, and a map designed around your control scheme to chain tricks and land them is always going to be better than scaling a street primarily designed for pedestrians. I don't care if those lamp posts exists in real life, the only thing i'm thinking with the controller in hand is that they are in the way. i don't care if those red benches are set up this way in real life, they feel to close to each other so it's a pain to naturally chain tricks. Don't expect any kind of point system or goals to reach, there are none.  In term of visuals, I strongly believe that you can still have personnality while retaining the realism that you aim for. And right now the game has this mobile phone realism looks. Skybox is bland, lighting is bland, textures are bland, COD color palet type...bland. I don't know, it's not badly made in itself, but it just doesn't breathe life to me.   Sound design is fonctionnal.  And now the price tag. Far too costly to my liking but it depends on you really. If you see the 20$ price as an investement toward building a new game, the way a kickstarter works than YES i recommend it. There is a very solid chunk of gameplay here that could poitentially translate into a well made game.  But if you would treat this product as any 20$ early access game, this is clearly not enough. Especially if you compare it to the Skate 1 demo 10 years ago which was free at the time and offered a bigger and better map, had a complete trick system and score system, and overall, was just a better product. For free. Than NO i wouldn't recommend it.   With all that said, I only wish that Easy Day Studio prove me wrong on this one and improve on every thing i said, i'd gladly change my review back (i already did thanks to this nice dude in my comment section). I crave for a new skate game, but right now Skater XL as it is, can't be worth a recommandation from me. Wait and see.
no way worth the money, i know its a beta but the animations need alot of work and the map is tiny. also if you wana skate goofy instead of reg it messes up the controls. should be a free demo atmost.
Refunded this game. Not even close to worth the £15.49  It may be harsh to compare it to another Early Access game but SkaterXL got released on EA with a janky control system, animations that are NOT as smooth as implied in the demo, and a playable area the size of a postage stamp.  Descenders released on EA with 4 fully fleshed out worlds, AND an overworld, AND loads of bikes and customisation options literally the playable area in SkaterXL is smaller than the Descenders overworld.  It's not even close to worth the purchase price at this point.
I Hate to hit the do not reccommend button, but the price on this makes no sense. I am really into early access on these things, and backed session (at a pretty high tier), but I got access to dev streams etc. Idk. $20 for this is just not worth it. I am going to keep my money in there because I believe in the devs, I think they will make a good game out of it and I will change my review with updates. But for now it just seems like a prettier looking and more polished version of session, but gives up what it gains by being less fine tuned in controls.   I will update this review when the game is updated. I just cant recommend others buy it for a 20 right now, unless you just want to support the developers (which is awesome and what im doing!) I just disagree with calling this "early access". its more, "prototype demo".
**Edit 4/15/2019:** Not many updates to speak of, I still cannot recommend this game until we see more content, the map is tiny, the devs seem quiet.  **************  **Edit 2/12/2019:** -Devs finally put out somewhat of an update, no real roadmap or plan for the community to see.  -They fixed about 2 minor bugs that I know of, and added some decent visual upgrades.  --Still no new map(s) --I still cannot recommend this unless you are OK with paying $20 for a small demo, although it sounds like they are going to be working more on it through 2019 (we can hope)  *************  After putting in a few hours of play (started to enjoy making lines around the small area we have unlocked) I can give my honest opinion.   This is an early access game (upon release on 12/19 this feels more like a small demo) I will try to update my review based on new additions to the game.  -because it's early access I expect bugs/glitches, and the ones I have had so far are in no way game breaking.   You can only use a controller with this game (no keyboard/mouse). -I noticed an issue that prevented the game from recognizing my Xbox One controller when I had my Razer Orbweaver connected to my PC (this is recognized as a gamepad in windows, which I believe the game assigned to itself instead)   There is only 1 level which is not that large, but I enjoyed the small variety of ledges/rails/stairs/manual pad during my gameplay.   It took a good hour to get a decent feel for the controls, even then, they feel really awkward to use. -each stick essentially controls a foot, so you have to use both sticks for most tricks, which is really not that intuitive on a controller (it is for use the closest to real skating I think you can get on a controller, but that actually is a turn off to me because I know I can't do a kickflip noseslide down a double set rail but in a game I get to do the stuff with some practice, but with current controls, it feels like a chore to do multiple tricks in 1 combo)   Pros:  -Good looking enviroment. -Very good ambient sound going on, if that matters to anyone.  -Runs on ultra settings smoothly (as it should on my 1070ti, but this shows it is at least optamized halfway decent unlike a lot of early access games)   Cons:  -Lack of keyboard support  -Lack of controller settings/keybind changes -Lack of settings in general (probably because it's early access, so this isnt too worrying for me)    Overall, the game is a decent base for a skating game and I look forward to hearing about updates or plans they have for the game as time goes on. I really hope they have options regarding the controls, as the way they currently are would really diminish the fun I would have playing in a larger area. ( My preference would be closer to SKATE controls)   I cannot currently recommend this game to anyone as $20 is a lot for the 1 small area, although this will hopefully change in the furture.
The price is the problem. You get very little content for the $20 price tag. The developers have no social media presence other than their mobile skate game which is x10 times better for a 1/4 of the price. The gameplay is good, graphics are good but there is no content. The game is very early access. The developers keep boasting about 4 years of development. You can buy pipe which is %50 of the cost of this game. The developers have no social media presence other than their mobile game skater twitter.   I would wait until there is more content or release some sort of roadmap. The game is fun and good but not worth the money in its current state. I wouldn't buy it until the devs become more active with either social media or the community.
This game should have adapted the Skate series controls. I would be pusing dozens of hours even into this small area if it only had better controls. It's hard to shake of hundres of hours and years of playing Skate games. Game may be good for newcomers, hopefully they can convert or have the option to mimic Skate.
Decent enough base for a skating game. I don't like the controls and it won't let me rebind them. The feet teleport to the board after a flip trick is completed so it's hard to actually fail a trick unless you hold the analog in a direction for too long.  The price is way too high for what this game actually is, which is just a small outdoor area with a few ledges and stairs to do some tricks in. There are less than 20 tricks in the game and they are all super basic. I really hope this game gets fleshed out but it is most definitely not worth the money in it's current state.
I want to like this game but in its current state its definitely not worth $23, maybe like $5 tops. I would barely call this a tech demo. The controls are interesting and it has potential but it has a long way to go.
Just played 22$ for a game it wont even let me play. This game is so far horrible and i havent even fucking played it
Sorry but after 5 Min I did every single trick and saw the whole game atm its like a demo ... Invest your money better buying a used xbox 360 or ps3 and get skate 3 !
it is literally a free demo you're paying $20 for, so far. Seems like this could be amazing, but as of right now it's about 2 minutes of enjoyment.
WHY W0ULD YOU EVEN PUT THE 3 LITTLE THINGS TO SKATE AND NOT PUT SOME RUN WAY TO EVEN SKATE THEM? this is not worth 20$ thanks a lot and the controls blow for this game dont bother buying it
I was so excited to get home and download this game I have been waiting since the annoucement, I really wish I had taken 2 minutes to read these reviews or I would have hold off. For $22 this is a joke of an early access release, I get they need money to produce the game more and I am extremely hopeful the game will progress down the road. But thats $20 I couldve spent on something else over christmas.  1 limited skate spot, broken audio, but some awesome potential.   The controls make sense to anyone who is a skater, I have enjoyed that part so far
My initial review on release day was a good one, but boy am I disappointed now. I totally regret buying early in development, because it already feels like they abandoned this game.   No updates in 3 months (yeah, not counting the fix of 2 minor animations in febuary)  Not even communicating with the customers on whats to come.....  The game immensly lacks content and motivation. I´d say dont bother, the early access trap found a new victim.   Easy Day Studios is a name to remember.....for shady buisness that is.
$20 for a tech demo, wait to buy this but if you want to support the devs in hopes of an early release indie team actually going through with flushing out an actual experience instead of the trend of staying in early access then feel free to drop the 20 bones. Other than that its better to save ya money and wait for good progress.
yo man let me tell ya. i skateboard, i played skate 1 2 and 3 like fuckin hell. i was excited as shit when i saw this and uh yeah man im dissapointed. the controls are weird, i dont like turning with the got dang bumpers. i sort of like the two feet thing, using each analog stick for each foot but it dont feel right... i need to turn with one of the joysticks, i just need it. this is definitely not worth 20 bucks, but i would love to see this game get better and i think starts with changing the turning system. fuckin hell man who the hell turns with the bumpers.
Unplayable due to the broken controls for now. Plus just a small map... May change my opinion in the future but for now, it's a NO.
Right now it's not worth it. The controls are smart, but I prefer the Skate controls way more. You can't steer while you crouch to pop. Everything you slightly bump into sends you off your board. Can't walk. You spin using triggers which I find annoying. Needs a lot of work. I requested a refund as I simply don't find it playable right now. Will see what happens as time passes. Great effort thus far but I can't honestly reccommend anyone spend this amount for this content.
[b]Sign me up for a modern PC skateboarding game that pushes the genre forward.[/b] With that being said, [i]Skater XL[/i] *could* be that game in time. It certainly isn't right now. In fact what I have in front of me really should be a free tech demo to give players a taste of what could be in store for them. Certainly not $20 USD worth. And to be clear - the content in front of me is not 10/10 stellar. It's _okay_ at best. The controls feel good enough, and the animations are surely competent. [b]Yes, the developers made a successful mobile skateboarding game in the past - but do they have the know-how to make a more complex modern version to satisfy the PC market? Only time will tell.[/b]   I appreciate that the single currently available level is based on a real place - but it's a bit too bland and small given that this is all we have right now. I understand that this is an Early Access campaign, but considering that the current content and controls apparently took 4 years to build, I'm not confident this will be baked enough for serious use anytime soon. The devs approximate two years until full release, so I'll keep it on my radar, but the whole thing simply isn't in a place that I can recommend friends run out and drop twenty dollars. Finally, there is no score system, and the ragdoll crashes leave something to be desired.   [b]Pros:[/b] +The PC platform needs a quality skateboarding game that pushes the genre forward. +The controls feel pretty good for this title.  [b]Meh:[/b] =While I appreciate the realistic skating spot available - it's far too small and bland to compel me to keep playing considering the high asking price. This is a demo by any measure.  [b]Cons:[/b] -Asking price is far too high for what little we have right now. Yes, there is potential, but boy oh boy is there a long road of developement in front of us. -No half-pipes or any kind of vertical skating. This is curious to me. Why wouldn't they throw just a bit of this in there to showcase it? Perhaps they are still working out details and bugs with it - which makes me nervous. That element is a big part of these skateboarding games. -The ragdoll physics really break immersion. Upon crashing, the camera lingers just a tad too long on your motionless body which feels really fake. I'd almost rather (or at the very least, like to try) a few fixed crashing animations based on momentum. -Even something small like adding in score would add a bit of complexity and reason to keep playing right now. -I watched several videos before purchasing, but only after I actually had it in my hands did I notice that even on Ultra settings - the graphics are fairly bad. This isn't a huge deal for me, but I just expected a bit more at this point in time. -It's missing several details that I'd expect from a modern skateboarding game. For example, when you ride over cracks in the pavement I kept wanting to hear that audible and iconic 'click' that skateboard wheels make. The devil is often in the details.  [b]I sincerely hope this becomes something great, but unfortunately it looks like we are going to have to wait a good while.[/b] I would love to be able to change this review to a positive if that time comes.
It's a decent prototype but thin on content and gameplay, even for Early Access standards.   I love skateboarding games and reallly wanted to support this, but I cannot personally recommend anyone else buy this for $20 until the developers begin to speak openly on what they're working on next, and when to expect some content updates and gameplay improvements. When that happens I will be able to recommend it.   I know it's just the start, but we're all seemingly in the dark here with just vague mentions of their plans and a longer roadmap via the EA description, so all I can do is make assumptions. And my assumption is that Skater XL is at least least 3-5 major updates away from hitting the price point they launched this proof of concept with.   The foundation is solid enough but it has a loooooooooong way to go. Developer transparency and establishing a consistent and open dialogue with the community going forward will do a lot to help this succeed. I wish them the best!
The controls feel too against the player, making this game more of a chore than anything. I grew up playing THPS, and loved all 3 Skate titles. Keep trying to find a good indie title to satisfy my need for a Skate 4. Unfortunately, this is not the one for me.
The game is unplayable, needs alot of work. Promising though.
AVOID THIS GAME TILL THEY FIX THE CONTROLLER ISSUE
pushing and no triangle (ps4) push. switch is awkward and anamtions are very stiff
My Game has so much lag I can hardely play it. Enyone know how to fix this?
Lack of communication from the dev's is a real slap in the face.
this game fucking blows.
They keep breaking more and more shit super buggy was better at release than now and thats super sad. PLEASE do something about the random rag dolls broken controls game feels like it was made yesterday.
Strange that it's a PC game with no compatibility for Keyboard. Bashed every key on my Keyboard and couldn't get passed the start screen. Couldn't even exit the game without going through task manager.  I'm one of those people who plays PC for mouse and keyboard and cosole for controllers.  
"As an indie, we chose to spend the last four [years] perfecting the thing that really matters for a new big step in the genre - the gameplay and controls. "  Somehow it doesn't play like that. Sure, the different control scheme needs some time to get used to, so I will give 'em that. But the clunky physics (you bail almost every time you come into contact with a wall, rail or ledge), the inconsistent framerate and the overall feel (the connection of the player to the skater/the board) make me wonder what you guys spent the last four years on.  I was hyping myself to death after watching the EA trailer, unfortunately I can't recommend this game, it's almost unplayable and moreover just frustrating (the typical frustration of not nailing a trick how you want is just something else if you feel you are in control of what you're doing).  The only hope I have is that you use the money of the EA well - although I have to admit that I feel kinda scammed, facing the pricetag of 17€ against the actual product that I received for it... Here's to you that things will change for the better.
Not worth buying in its current state. Thanks to Steam's refunding system I was at least able to treat this game as it should be treated - like a demo. It's not even a demo because I would cry my eyes out if this was the technological standard the game will be released on. The character just straight up ragdolls after he touches any object in the world, there are no options/settings ingame, no music and ambient sounds and you can't adjust the audio settings at all. And your only way to quit the game is by alt+f4'ing it or closing the window.  And then there are these controlls. At least they're better than the controlls of 'Session'. Compared to good old 'Skate' they give you a more realistic feeling of flipping your board. And there's my problem. When I play skateboarding games I don't need them to be an accurate simulation of real life skateboarding (mainly when it comes to the controlls). I just wanna have fun and pull every trick I want to with the lowest effort possible so I can ride the lines that are just going through my head. This doesn't work with controlls, which are so complicated that I need more than a hour to get into them. Why don't you just use the controll scheme from 'Skate'? They didn't copyright it and it worked just perfect. That's why so many people loved these games and wish for nothing more than 'Skate 4'.
Look its a great foundation dont get me wrong but $24 NZD? No music, no fall sounds, Leg broken when ridding, one tiny park (with no ramps or anything), no goals, camera looking from like the worst angle.   I get this is a indie company but his isnt a game this is a tech demo.  It would be nice to even know where the devs plan on going in the future but we have no info...
hyper realistic and fun but it needs a good chunk of work, the current map is too small, giving only the option to grinds or do flip tricks. the buttons are very touchy i try to ollie and end up doing a laser flip. i can see this game being a better skate then skate, it will just take some time and im looking forward too it, but $28 AUS dollars is not okay at the moment. ill try again in 3-6 months. maybe even 12 months
Steering with triggers= bad Should be a free demo at the state its in not early access
If you're here because you want a replacement for EA's lack of Skate 4, keep looking. This game made me feel bad for my controller who got to see the light of day for 15 minutes before going back into my desk drawer.   If you make any contact with a wall / rail / blade of grass in any way other than griding, you will fall off your board. Meaning no nudging against a wall and continuing to ride, you just fall down. I got too close to a wall, turned around, hit A to go forward and when my character kicked back to push forward, my foot hit the wall behind me and I fell over. You cant get up and back on your board, rather you respawn at a set respawn location every time you fall off (which is every 10 seconds) and very annoying.  The controls are good, the double analog foot control feels great but your character just cant land on the board and where games like Skate semi-magnetize to the rail youre trying to grind, in Skater XL you just gotta pray your trucks hold on to the rail or youre gonna front flip over yourself.  I wanted to like this game, and although it might improve later on, this is nothing but a tech demo. Not worth getting right now, and definitely not worth asking price.   Please Session be good, you're our only hope now.
Waste of money right now. What you get with this game (currently) is exactly what you see in the trailer. A miniscule amount of entertainment in possibly the smallest skateable area since THPS 1. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, and don't feel natural even after getting the hang of them.  While there's a bit of fun learning how to do tricks the interest doesn't last very long. The skater himself often does odd unnatural poses that brings to question the quality of the motion capture. There is absolutely no customization whatsoever, you're stuck with what you see in the trailer. The framerate tanks for no reason. I hope this game improves drastically over time with much larger areas to skate, customization, and overall performance, because as it stands right now I'm getting my refund.
Eh, it's not quite worth $20 just yet. Maybe about 10 or so minutes of content. Pretty much an assurance of life demo, currently.
Do NOT get this "game" at the state it is in at the moment. If you play the game at all, you will know that this is not even an early access game, it's just a small level in which you can try sloppy made tricks. The animations are very rough, there are no sounds for bailing out, and there is not even a menu for this game. Until this game has progressed even just a LITTLE further, stay away.
This just makes me want Skate 4. It's a $20 tech demo.
While I enjoyed the game to some extent and am glad I played it, I can't say it was worth the price.  Pros: Cute art, charming dialogue at times, short Cons:  Took half of the "estimated" hour for me to complete, I was not rushing, and generally was sort of bored the whole time. Jokes fell flat, I can't say any of them were really funny to me, but some of it was cute. I respect the game but its short length and scope left me feeling like I would rather have just watched someone else play it than bought it myself. It took me 30 minutes, plus 5 more to get some more achievements for the hell of it. This results in 25 cents a minute, and that is too much for something I can't say was too enjoyable.  The devs have a good tone in the game but I think it tried to be a lot of things and didn't quite succeed in any of them.
This dialogue is excellent.  Unfortunately, even though it advertises itself as a "short game," it still costs too much.  There are some very good and humorous games out there for free (try Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger and the Terribly Cursed Emerald).  Perhaps when more episodes/cases are available, a bundled set will be worth the experience and the witty repartee.
I made a mistake relying only on overall review score and not reading negative reviews, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. I hoped this would be a great short detective game, maybe with a mind-blowing plot twist or with non-trivial mechanics. I was excited to see a magnifying glass and tried to find a good use for it, I wrote down all clues from scientists' notebooks, but everything was useless. You take object A to person X, get object B in return, rinse and repeat about 10 times. I don't understand the purpose of the "cutscene" about books and internet. Why even make the frog say it to immediately "apologise" for it? Overall, I don't understand who is the target audience for this game. It could be advertised as a game for kids, however the dialogs probably wont't keep the kid interested. There is no challenge to be a good mystery/adventure game, no narrative or exploration possibilities to be a good walking simulator, no depth.
I have friends who made games like this in Game jams. This should be for free on itch.io I like the frog model tho. Keep making games, just some constructive criticism. Can't recommend this one, unless you get it for free. Peace!
I think the game is not bad if you are 6 year old. This is the game to buy for your kids.  That said, 30 minutes is not much for a game that's not free and outside of the funny characters I did not get anything out of it at all.
It's cute but... That's basically it. I wanted to like the game, but it's just too empty for me to enjoy, and the dialogues feel way to forced and verbose.
Do not buy this trap! I don't understand a single positive review. This "game" is 30 mins at best, and the only thing you do is talk to about 8 characters, fetch a couple obvious items for them, then the game ends. The word "detective" is in the title, but there's no detective work to do! It's true that the dialogue is funny and the music is nice, but that's it... for 30 mins.  When the credits roll, you assume it's a goof, but it's not. It's a middle finger and a waste of $5.
Cute art style and some quirky jokes, but (even taking into account the “this is a short game” warning) it honeslty feels more like a class project than a game meant for sale. Gameplay-wise, it brought back fond memories of a simple adventure game I made in HyperCard, circa 1996. Given the style and writing, I wish there was more to do and see.
I do kind-of feel bad for giving a thumbs-down, but this game is just too thin. The story, gameplay, characters, and dialog might be OK for a small child, but even then there are other games out there specifically designed for children that are much better than this one (Pajama Sam, for one). Depending on the child, there may be too much reading since there is no voice acting. The gameplay is just too simplistic and dull for any age, though. If you're shopping for a small child, keep looking.  It seems it isn't even sold as a "children's game", though. So, I'm not sure who the intended audience is. It is otherwise well-produced and has good intentions, but unfortunately, that isn't enough.  .
not recommended at all Bought this game because the character is cute, and that's all it got. The game itself is extremely short and simple, and the story is dumb and boring.
Would recommend this game to a preschooler. Too simple and dull for anyone older than that. Can you call something that has no gameplay "a game" by the way? Not sure...  P.S. I didn't actually play it for 4 hours, just left it on while I was away from the computer. The game will take you about 30 minutes to finish.
The presentation is what you can see and hear in the trailer, I would say it looks fine and sounds good. Gameplay is pretty much absent, it's just moving around a tiny island and talking with a handful of characters about two or three things each. You have a magnifying glass, which is never used to progress the game. The writing is pretty weak in my opinion, and it seems to be the focus of the game.
Boring and not funny. I expected more
I don't want to be the person that discourages starting out indie devs. Don't get me wrong, it's got that charm everyone is talking about. Certainly no technical or visual issues. Even as a 30 minute game, it struggled to fill that time with anything other than beeline objectives. I'm not saying I'd rather it be a harder point and click, but I wonder why it had to be one at all. If it's a kind of commentary on point and click adventures, I must've missed that. The writing is absolutely not my cup is tea.  I might be the wrong audience for this, however. Everyone else seems to enjoy it. I completely understand the constraints that this game was made under. There's potential, just no real system to warrant a game format. On that note fish market and alien casino do not distract you from the charm of the game with out of place objectives and in that regard they are better despite lacking any systems for the player.
Grace Bruxner brings a refreshingly different personal esthetic, sense of humor, and (mainly) silliness to this short adventure game.  As Rock Paper Shotgun said, it is (and Grace is) "endearingly daft".  The adventure puzzles used to advance the linear plot are dead simple, but are not intended to be challenging, they are simply an excuse to share some silliness with the player.  It's a pleasant way to spend an hour or so.  I'm looking forward to further adventures with this mystery-solving Frog Detective.  Edit: Kotaku (favorable) review: https://kotaku.com/a-funny-game-about-being-a-frog-detective-1830640811  And the SOUNDTRACK by Dan Goldman is now available for download from bandcamp, in exchange for a donation, if you liked the game music...the 5 tracks are short but nice:  https://dangolding.bandcamp.com/album/the-haunted-island-a-frog-detective-soundtrack
The Haunted Island, a Frog Detective Game might be for the absolutely casual, short, cutesy game seeker, but I can't recommend this game.  This game doesn't have much to offer, even as a self-admittedly short experience. Basically the only gameplay you'll have is picking up a couple of items, talking to the handful of inhabitants within the few square meter area and exhausting their 3-4 topics. The game might be about a detective, but doesn't really involve detective work. The humor could've been the saving grace, but it never really shifts from characters simply being weird and jokes relying on constant non-sequiturs.  (Also, the combination of minimalistic graphical style and mocap feels really unsettling for some reason.)
Forget the game play, that is very slow, but it can't even determine that an Ace is 1 or 11. There is only 2 characters to play against. Just not very good.
It only took me 10 minutes to realize that the game was garbage.  You have to wrestle with the controls at the title screen when you name your character, since even basic functions aren't laid out for you to begin with. But the absolute kicker is that the random number generator is extremely skewed in the house's favor. It's ridiculous. Refunded with no regrets.
First off, this is not a metroidvania.  It is a level based platformer that has some exploration aspects in some of the levels.  Of the 4 levels I played 2 were linear, and 2 had some exploration.  That is not a bad thing, I actually prefer linear platformers to metroidvanias, but if you buy this thinking it is a metroidvania you will be disappointed.    This game is very heavily inspired by castlevania, just looking at the trailer you can clearly see the influence of that game here.  Many enemies are similar and the sub weapons are all identical to those you would find in various castlevania games.  In this game you can hold 2 sub weapons at once, which is neat, and you also have a block button which is fairly useless 90% of the time.    The game plays pretty well and I initially was having fun with it.  The controls are responsive, the graphics are nice, the music is really good and could fit right into a real castlevania game.  So why is this not recommended?  This game falls into hard for the wrong reasons and that is why I ultimately put it down.  You only have 1 life, and while you do have unlimited continues, continuing puts you back at the beginning of the level.  The levels themselves are fairly long, which is a good thing, but one mis step and you are sent back to the start of the level.  This gets frustrating very fast as the levels progress in difficulty you are given absolutely no room for error, mess up once and back to the beginning you go, only to have to replay the entire level from scratch.    What makes matters worse is there are an abundance of platforms that flip when you step on them.  If you played any castlevania game you know exactly what I'm talking about.  You jump on the platform and you have to quickly jump off them or the platform rotates and you fall down.   The thing is that the timing for these platforms is way too precise.  You have to jump the second you hit the platform or you fall, there is absolutely no margin for error, if you are off by a fraction of a second you fall, die, and have to replay an entire level from the start.    When you die on a boss you continue right from them, which is definitely a good thing, but making your way through the harder levels is just more frustrating then fun.  A life system or more frequent checkpoints would alleviate this problem, as it stands now the game is just too frustrating to play.
Every Action in the game has a free bug that comes with it. This Game is satan and im calling the police
crashes every 2 sec or th resorses dont spawn
Very broken. you can craft every item with out the proper materials( or it is a bug i just stumbled upon), there is nothing to prevent high up predators from spawning exactly where you spawn, and the inventory is accessed by tab? why not i? also, button mapping and audio sliders would be a great addition. Also, attack music never goes away, even when there are not any predators around
an hour. If you wanted to take your sweet time you could probably do 2 hours, but that's it. The sprites are cute, cg on par with everything else from cherry kiss, but for such a short experience the price is absurd. Don't buy this unless there's a good sale going on, of you'll be disappointed,
it just never got my attention
This is a sex game. Little to no real plot. And while your character is obstensively supposed to choose between the three girls, he, of course, manages to choose the fourth option.  Not sure it is really worth the price...
First of all, [i]Angel, Devil, Elf and Me![/i] is a [b]nukige[/b] game. So the H scenes, not the story, is the intended selling point. On a superficial level, the game delivers. The introduction to the story (as little story there is) is somewhat comedic, the CGs are not half bad, it has good voice acting, the BGM is good and its selection has some comedic quality to it too.  But then again, is that enough for a visual novel, even if it's nukige? Not for me, especially as there are several aspects of the game that disqualify it as a [i]good[/i] nukige. [list][*] Even for a nukige game the story is lacking, well... story. [*] It's a kinetic novel (meaning there are no choices to make), which makes the lack of story even more obvious. [*] The "facial animation" is eye blinking and moving lips. But the lips are just a rapid cycling of several mouth forms and not synchronous at all like they are e.g. in games using the e.mote sprite animation engine. [*] It uses [i]"x-ray"[/i] (internal display of ejaculation), which sees increasing use in recent games (see [i]Ditzy Demons[/i]). And again it is completely ridiculous. While they do get the crude anatomy quite right this time, it still displays intrauterine ejaculation, which is physiologically impossible (the cervix is very narrow and plugged by slime), and even worse,... [*] There are several scenes where the girls are pregnant (~6 months I'd say) and [b]there's no baby in the uterus[/b]! [*] There is a loli side character that's only used to set up the harem ending and literally disappers without ever being heard of again.[/list] If you listen to all the uninteresting moaning and talk during the H scenes it might take you 6 to 7 hours to play through (it took me a bit over 2 hours - my displayed time is longer because I left the game running while editing the vndb, preparing food etc.).  So it comes down to deciding if you want to pay 10$/€ for 28 CG/8 H scenes and about 30-50 minutes of reading a practically non-existent (if sometimes funny) story. My suggestion is to wait for a -75% sale. 4/10, not recommended
Full Review: http://wamsoon.com/index.php/2018/11/08/angel-devil-elf-and-me-quick-hit-review/  Art okay everything else not okay.
A demon succubus girl who is a virgin? WTF is this crap?!  I get that some people are into virgin girls, but you didn't have to make ALL of the characters virgins, you know?
very bad
II didn't expect anything and was still disappointed.
Do you know how much fun slide puzzles are?    Not very fun.  Tedius and boring.  This is a game that treats the most tedius and boring gameplay like it's the height of game design, so it adds crap like timers and performance bonuses.  Bleh.  Can we move past slide puzzles please?  Match three games have overstayed their welcome as well, just saying.
This actually dosen't come with anything else than the pictures in the preview.
I really wanted to like this game but its it has many problems like glitches with the overworld, skills, items, and much more. The art style for the characters huds and the title screen is amazing so how come the in game art looks very rushed and poorly drawn .One good this is that the game has some interesting ideas like the shakes.
If you're easily amused by cheap jokes and """"""politically incorrect"""""" """"""""""""humor""""""""""""" this game might be for you. I wouldn't recommend it to ANYBODY at its current price point. It is in dire need of some sort of editor for grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. I know English is not the creator's first language but surely you could have asked a friend or took a little extra time to proofread? The gameplay itself I cannot say much for. The battles are relatively fast paced and there's a lot of party members, but there's not a whole lot of complexity or strategy going on behind their movesets so you'll probably be cycling through the same 2-3 moves on each character.  basically don't buy the game if you have a shred of dignity because this is the same fucking "traps are gay" "attack helicopter" etc etc shit you would find on ifunny for free
The game was ok until it got to the part with the 3 tests. They took me multiple hours to get past and were mostly devoid of fun. I don't know why you would want to add something like that to this game. The one with the ghost didn't even register me half the time. Also there are quite a few glitches in the other parts of this game as well. Like falling off a cliff in the snow area only to land on air and then be able to fly afterwards. As for the jokes, most of them were not my cup of tea but i can look past that. I did like all the character you can get but the 3 trials broke the pace of the game completely.
What an absolute slog. Like a sluggish version of Flashback/Another World and (no spoilers don't worry) final boss who's mechanics are literally a lockpicking mini-game. Animations are nice though.  Several cheap deaths. For example be careful and hang off a ledge before dropping down off-screen > whoops there's spikes there on the next screen specifically designed to kill you if you do that. You were supposed to leap of faith running jump.   Okay lesson learned, next obvious leap of faith take a running jump > ha idiot, you were supposed to carefully drop and hang off of this one! Enjoy replaying the last section from the beginning.  There's so many drops that lead off screen where you literally have to guess if you should take them fast or slow. It's not 'faithful' to the games it's paying homage to (prince of persia etc) to include this. It's just obnoxious.  Also had to Alt-F4 three times because the game is buggy as hell.
Beautiful graphics, beautiful sound; horrendous controls, lag, terrible typeface.  The controls kill it completely.
There is soooo much I like about this game, it's oozing with style and the music is great. Unfortunately, there is also little to no tutorialization, often times you'll accidentally do something that allows you to beat an enemy or figure a platforming section out. The controls are very unresponsive. I also started developing headaches during my sessions playing it. Checking with RTSS shows that this game is locked to 18 FPS... WTF. Because of that, I find it difficult to recommend this to others.  The "classic game remastered" marketing hoax was genuinely entertaining and had a lot of effort put into it. I was really let down by what the final product turned out to be because there is a lot of good stuff to this game.
Sadly, complicated controls, floaty movement, bugs and broken combat (especially cover-based shooting) ruins near awesome game.  If devs made some fixes and patches - it's worth cheking out. Maybe one of the best cinematic platformers (i played maybe every game in this sub-genre wich i can find) But now - for your own risk. Too many butthurt and rage because of poor movement and controls. :\   And yeah, final boss is garbage. Shittiest thing i've ever seen.
Love artstyle and gameplay, but technically it is an absolute mess - some areas are unplayable due to low or unconsistent framerate (it is a retro-lowress CGA game!!!!), even settings in options menu reset sometimes - and you wonder why control scheme is noe different. Hope this issues will be addressed soon, can't recommend now.
Great style, terrific music, awesome setting, but terrible controls and combat. Eternal Castle has so much going for it, but it is done in by a bizarre insistence on its woeful combat dominating an otherwise cool and artful game. Very disappointing.
I really wish I could recommend this game, but I can't at this point.  The art style is one of the game's biggest strengths. The pixel art is fantastic, and the animations are fluid and organic. Unfortunately, the art style can also be one of its main weaknesses: Eternal Castle has a shockingly limited color palette (you will not see more than 4 colors on the screen at once), which *severely* cripples the readability of the environment, worsened by frequent dark scenes, high contrast and harsh lighting. To watch, The Eternal Castle is beautiful. To play, it can be frustrating.   Important objects will often blend into the background or shadows, backgrounds will often blend in with foregrounds - Your player character (which is all black, with a small edge highlighted) fades into dark backgrounds, making it very easy to lose sight of where you are in tense moments. Your character also looks very similar to a specific enemy type, making it difficult to find your character in particularly crowded encounters. Giving the player character its own color might alleviate some of those problems.   The controls felt a little clunly even for a cinematic platformer. Where actions in a game like Oddworld Abe's Oddysee feel decisive and reliable, Eternal Castle's felt a bit inconsistent. Configurable controls would be great as well, although I felt the default keyboard controls were pretty manageable.   I think the core ideas of the Eternal Castle are great, and the visuals are very striking, with great environment art and incredible animations. If the gameplay felt tighter, and the use of color was more readable to the player, I would recommend this game, but as of right now, it is more enjoyable to watch than to play.  
I wanted to love this game, but I just couldn't get to that point because of the controls. Now as I understand it with rotoscoping and movement animations, one animation have to finish before another one can start - hence "unresponsive" controls. But hot-diggedy damn, the different animations needed to jump when starting a run, or in the middle of a run, are wildy different, more than I remember Another World being.  But controls in a game are rarely game-breaking, as long as they are consistent. After I failed to complete a jump that includes several falls/jumps - where landings have other animations - I swear the player character just stops even though I'm holding to run. That's when controls feel like buggy bullshit.   It's a pretty game that really shines in its beauty sometimes. I'm really happy this was made, and I want to give big respect to the developers for sticking through this project. I appreciate the love put into the breakable environment. But with these subtly buggy controls, I'd rather watch someone else play.
2.5/5 TL;DR: Awful controls and combat, Amazing soundtrack, Meh graphics at times (Pretty beautiful pixels for most of it), Minor bugs around, Not really replayable despite the game pushing it I bought this game expecting a game which captures the nostalgia of games from the 80's.  But this game feels like a 90's game with 80's graphics, while bringing less than a modern platformer.  The soundtrack is amazing, synthwave is great. It does capture the nostalgic feeling.  The visuals are ok, fantastic at times especially at the end of the level, but rarely impressive when going through the common enemies. The limited colour palette severely limits the details which can be added to the foreground and background, as there are time where things are unrecognisable, which leads to a lot of trial and error when it comes to traversing a level.  The weapons are meh, they're nothing special, a gun is a gun, a melee weapon is a melee weapon, the sword is fantastic, it gives a breath of fresh air compared to the other weapons, shame it appears really late onto the game though.  The camera does an ok job, it doesn't look down when you crouch near a ledge though, which means that you need to just go through a big jump blindly.  At times, during moments where the character is in chase, the camera barely keeps up which is really annoying, the character is at the right side of the screen and the upcoming jumps can barely be seen.  The controls and combat is terrible, the movement seems to have an input delay.  The game sacrifices gameplay for asthetics and tries to be as similar as possible as older games, we get it. But the movement is terrible and that's a big shame and a big minus for a game that could be above average if it wasn't for that.  The melee combat is needlessly complicated despite the game using only two buttons for combat: holding down the X or LMB holds a combat stance and holding up while doing so blocks, which is complete nonsense if the game throws a lot of enemies since blocking barely does anything in that scenario.   The graphics make it hard to distinguish yourself from the enemies at times, especially if there are many on screen, which leads to button mashing the attack button to survive, completely throwing away the combat element which are intended to be used.   I wish the game had a specific button for blocking because you need to press the attack button to hold the stance, which means you need to attack first to block.   Ranged combat in this game suffers from the same problem, you need to aim with RMB or Z then LMB or X to fire, it does sound simple on paper, but in practice, it is not.   Everything would be solved if it was activated with one button press instead of two. Since you can't fire without aiming.   Movement is an issue at times, sprinting and then turning around has a delay which is annoying if you need to dodge an enemy's attack, especially bosses. It's like controlling a manual car on a two dimensional plane, it's awful.  The game is fragmented with minor bugs, which includes glitching into out of bound walls, climbing onto something and then floating in the air. But no hard crash.  The game runs at 18 fps, but it drops on Game Overs to simulate slow motion and when reloading a checkpoint from dying, which will happen often. That's okay though, would be a plus to the visuals if it were 60 fps.  I did like the metroidvania feel of this game, although it seems to take on a more linear way of things. The game provides the player 4 levels, 3 of which are available from the start. Although the player can start with any of the 3 levels, completing one instead of the other first gives the player items which makes other parts easier although that's just on one occasion, (Tower level to Wasteland level then Dark and rainy forest level seems to be the best approach).   One specific boss makes it hard to figure out how to defeat it, as the spacebar button is barely used in this game, and it is required to progress through it, which quite annoyed me.  With that said, it's an okay game, but its clunky combat, movement and frequent minor glitches holds it back. A few game designing mishaps here and there which makes one boss confusing, chase scenes clumsy and controls annoying. Without these cons, it could very well be a game which holds its grounds.
I loved Another World and I would marry Flashback if I could, and I *really* love the graphical aesthetic they’ve got going in this game…  Too bad they decided to bring back the control schemes of the games of the 80s. There are *quite* a few innocuous control innovations that’ve come in the last 30 years, I feel. I’m all for slow methodical gameplay, but… just the jumping is the worst I’ve experienced … ever? the character can some how jump 6 meters horizontally (plus two, as long as there is a ledge).. but only 5 centimetres vertically?  shame. With proper controls I would have given this something like a 10 or at least a 9. 
so let's start with charcters you can chose 2 charcters a boy and a girl(basically the same) and when i went into the game and spent about 15 min i didn't recongize me and the enemy  there alot of enemies in one place and you can't know where you are and it's super hard, any mistake you will be punished for that which make it challenging alot of people like that, but the clunky movement is what makes this game bad you can't play it with a controller it's hard and the responsiveness it's awful i refunded the game after i played it for 1 hour didn't enjoyed it at all.
Awful optomization, and clunky momentum based movement. Dont buy it, just watch somebody else play it.
The Eternal Castle. Marketed as a 'remaster' of a game cut from the same fabric as rotoscoped classics such as Prince of Persia, Karateka, and Out of This World (a.k.a Another World), it definitely hits on several notes which made these games memorable, but ultimately fails to deliver due to several unfortunate factors.  The most evident issue, as well as the most unfortunate one, is the graphics. I'm rarely one to judge a game by the quality of the graphics, especially if the gameplay is sound, but The Eternal Castle's crisp animations and cool environments are overshadowed by the distinct, albeit rough, colors and lighting. The trailer and screenshots do a good job of showcasing some quality animation and design work--it's clear that the artists put plenty of effort into capturing the same feel of Flashback and Out of This World. The issue, however, is that once you take control all of these colors and shadows blend together, making it difficult to determine at times what is scenery and what is a death trap waiting to slice your face open. The issue I have with this is that this could have been easily remedied by using a standard color scheme ala the very games that spawned this one--granted it wouldn't look as artistic, but I think gameplay would improve drastically if the artstyle didn't make it so darn hard to find where the player is.  Issue number 2 is clearly visible in my playtime. If you're like me and somewhere around the 'slightly above below average intelligence' scale, you can still finish The Eternal Castle in roughly 2 hours, maybe even faster if you have the whole afternoon to play it. This isn't so much an issue with the gameplay so much as it is with the investment--$10 for a 2 hour game is unfortunately too much, especially when the game has limited to no replay value save for speedrun bragging rights. The good news is that I ended the game saying "Huh, that's all?" rather than  "Oh thank Christ, it's finally over", which means that there's some good gameplay there--there just isn't enough to warrant dropping $10 on it. Some may say that the game makes up for this with difficulty, but even if you haven't played Flashback or any of the games The Eternal Castle was influenced by, you're still given a large health bar, plenty of checkpoints, and more weaponry than you can shake a stick at. Many of the puzzles are swiftly solved after the first mistake, and once you get the hang of not sprinting off of ledges you'll find yourself dying a lot less as you progress. In conclusion, The Eternal Castle got several things right. The keyboard controls served me well throughout the playthrough and there are some genuinely interesting setpieces and secrets to find, but the distracting graphic design, lack of replay value, mild difficulty, and the length of the game coupled with the $10 price tag leave me saying "No, I wouldn't pay full price for this." If you're interested, definitely check it out on a sale. Otherwise wait and see.
Not as good as Dark Souls Remastered.
"REMASTERED", ok. original game doesn't exist and devs trying to fool people with that fake archives online with rubbish inside. marketing ploy. i don't know why you'd do this, since game looks cool, but this is just disrespectful and worth a refund.
Game looks and sounds amazing until you actually need to read ingame text:  Original - https://i.imgur.com/vZe4gIo.png  From the Store page minus power of caps:  Year 2xxx - before the fall of the cyber-net society extra terrestrial human colonization units were able to construct parallel survival facilities around their root planet in order to reestablish a self sufficient ecosystem in space the procedure was discontinued by numerous terrorist attacks to the main core servers after countless global wars all systems got shut down and the procedure was never again resumed polluted waters climate change radioactive warfare and absence of resources caused the majority of the remaining humans to decease the last colonization units in space were able to survive for several years before extinguishing most of the remaining resources needed for survival scavenger units were sent back to earth to gather materials in order to restore the self-sufficient ecosystem facilities and continue the extraterrestrial colonization procedure one of the units was sent back to earth but the unit never returned it's been too long since the last time I was in touch with her I know she is in danger and I know she needs my help going back there by my own is a suicide mission but I have no choice left either I go, or she dies  I'd be really surprised if anyone could read 100% of that in game.   What also would be nice is simple Controller Vibrate Y/N, not everyone likes their hands shaken "on action". Finally the resolution options... I do not mind the 18FPS game play, the CGA colors or sometimes hard too see what is going on, but at least allow us to set the resolution.   PS. Another plus point would be an option to rebind the keys; I know its going for the "old look and feel" but really guys.  For now until the text is fixed it is a negative rating.
I have beat two levels  from the game so far, and I'm pissed.  Being old school does not mean having bugs, unresponsiveness, not to mention that retro visuals make some levels very difficult to understand. There's no feelings of satisfaction in finally beating a level, since you have to adjust to the lag and the akwardness of the combats. (finally beating a roof chase after 10 attempt in the a row because your character decide to stop running for no reason in not a nice feeling) The Prince Of Persia was not this unresponsive mess, so as Another World, for comparison.  Still, good soundtrack and fascinating atmosphere, a curiosity, not for all hands.
It's like Another World if the controls were overly complicated / half as responsive and there were walls of text you didn't care about.  But it's got a fake backstory and that "a e s t h e t i c" the kids crave and that's all that really matters, right?
The basic idea behind "Write word" is a good one, but it has been poorly executed.  The basic functioning of the game is as follows: A word or phrase flashes up on the screen, it stays there for 5 seconds (although you can get rid of it sooner by hitting Enter or the Space Bar), and then a box appears for you to type the word/phrase into - the game lasts for a set time, following which you are given your score.  However, there are several problems with it: 1) The text doesn't stay up on the screen; you have to memorise it and then type it. That was basically fine for me, as English is a strong suit of mine, but for poor spellers this arrangement would be rather bad. I would suggest that that the text to be typed should remain at the top of the screen, so that the words can be copied, if needed.  2) I must admit that, in my rush to type fast, I may have been overzealous in hitting Enter or Space, which means that the next word to be typed disappears. As I'm not a touch typist, I usually look at my keyboard, so that means that the word has disappeared by the time I look up. However, this sort of problem would be fixed if the game's creator followed my suggestion as per point 1.  3) You can't exit it whilst you're mid-game - you either have to wait for the game to finish or hit Alt-F4 (or Ctrl-Alt-Del). I'd suggest that an exit button is added (one that could be used during gameplay - but obviously not in a spot that could be hit accidentally).  I would also suggest that the developer adds an open-ended option (with the text to be copied located at the top of the screen), so that "Write word" could be used as an educational tool to help improve spelling and/or typing. Upon exiting the session, the game could then give a score based upon either speed or typos that had to be corrected (perhaps give both results separately). Then educators might be inclined to recommend it.  You get all of the Steam achievements for the game as soon as you score 10,000 points, so Steam completionists might like it. Indeed, there is a button in the lower left of the screen which players can just keep clicking on, in order to produce the correct letters on the screen.  It's only a small game (less than 10 mb), so it won't be taking up much room on your computer, which is a good thing. However, it's not a very exciting game, so there's not very much replayability in it (unless, for some reason, you are an individual who is invigorated just by typing random words).  "Write word" is by no means terrible, but it has some issues that should be fixed, and - even if those issues are fixed - it would be considered to be boring for most people. As a typing game, it's OKish, but not much more. It's about a 4/10.
It's OK. You get given a certain amount of time to type as many words as possible. The reason I am not recommending it is that I got all the 'achievements' in my first attempt, and I am not a good typer. Because of this I have played it for 1 minute and am unlikely to play again. I actually had to open it for another 4 minutes just so I could give this review.  If you are like me and need solid goals to achieve anything in life, then give this a miss. I'd be happy to change my review if more challenging achievements were added, because the layout is nice and it is less than a quid.
its a cool game but the game coudlnt even recognize my mouse
This is a hard game to review, and I'm on the fence. Unfortunately I've gotta round down as the game is more of a concept. But you have to know the scariest thing of all...  Lost in Vivo is an unfinished game.   I can see the game being priced around ten dollars, and I'd recommend it on sale. Twelve is a huge stretch, even for all the secrets and more. Lost in Vivo is a first person psychological horror game which pulls most of its content from games such as the Silent Hill franchise and more. It does a great job, but I could have finished the game in half the time at a leisurely pace if I hadn't been set back many times due to bugs. I finally decided to write this review after being set back in New Game+ because of game breaking bugs.  But here's the thing, and if you are leaning towards playing the game DO NOT READ THESE SPOILERS! They are very important, and if you read them then there's pretty much no point in playing the game. [spoiler] Vivo takes inspiration from games such as Eternal Darkness where your PC would blue screen, delete your save, and have false bugs to screw with the player. I love this concept more than anything, reality bending is really really cool. But to do it you have to do it right, have it frequently to make the player question their sanity and mess with YOU, the player! The character doesn't see the screen errors, you do!.. But then why have a main character and a pretty garbage story line at all? I'll get into this in the next stanza. [/spoiler]  The story, it should either be nonexistant or front and center, but like almost everything in Vivo its mediocre and boring. Games like Silent Hill have these really intricate stories which build the character and their environment for the sake of psychological horror. To have this style of horror without having a brain or psychology of a character to focus on, it makes no sense. Well, you, dear reader, may think differently! The characters are built from the setting, of course! Like a ghost story, the beautiful woman died in thew house and now she is an evil hag! Right?  Not really, I would only call one of the characters truly creepy, [spoiler] The Siren [/spoiler], and only one of them actually innovative [spoiler] the Ghost Train [/spoiler]. Otherwise there are generic grunts, lower level baddies, and low poly rip-offs. I was playing and heard of a creature which only moves when out of sight...  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...  Speaking of low poly, this is where the graphics come in. Its obvious this was made to replicate the original Silent Hill games, which I think is awesome! I love them! And its pretty damn obvious what Kira was going for here. But come on! The motion blur is gorgeous and just does not fit in at all. I love the motion blur but each time it occurred I could only think of how poor the graphics look in contrast. The lighting does the absolute same thing, its beautiful against a rough setting. This both kills the immersion and my eyes, just hoping to find a save point where I can sign off.  The music is nice, but the enemy theme is killing me. Its loud, its repetitive, and its a short loop. Its absolutely terrifying for 3 seconds until you pull out your riot shotgun and just yeet anything that tries to kill you. Plus you have an abundance of health; it regenerates on its own too! So the only thing you have to loose is your time. Be it the time you're waiting in a corner for yourself to heal or the time you have to replay everything back to the last checkpoint, which this game has very few of. I love horror games with weapons as I tend to be a very combative and tactical sort of person, but I might as well be the Doom Guy with how many rounds I'm spitting out with how little damage I am taking.  As of weapons you have a few firearms and a few basic melee weapons. There was some decent balance here which was alright, but ammo is supposed to be scarce, but by the time I hit the ending of the game I was stacked. And no, I was not hoarding or saving ammo, I was nearly running and gunning at that point just to beat the game.  The story... Oh boy... The story and intro nearly ruined this game for me. The intro takes around 3-5 minuets and you can not skip it unless you have New Game+. So if your save breaks or the game decides to screw you over with some game breaking bug and you have to restart now you have to see the same damn cut scene another 3 or 4 times. Good luck refunding after that much time being burned.   Now lets talk about what was good. The low FOV does a great job of creating a claustrophobic environment (as long as it doesn't make you sick. But don't fret! There is a FOV slider.), along with the style of corridors and small tunnels you need to climb through. The music is pretty good, it can get repetitive at times, but nothing terrible. The environments were heavily inspired by Silent Hill, adding a lot of variety while still keeping to the psychological horror with the setting slowly deteriorating and becoming more biological. And the boss! Oh my god did Kira do such an amazing job on the boss! [spoiler] The Siren is terrifying as it is, seemingly inspired by SCP-093 (Red Sea Object), and the large half-bodied abominations lucking within. Its scary, to say the least. And it likes to chase you. But so does everything in this game, right? There's an enemy which pretends to be your dog just to attempt to make your insides outsides! But no, you turn around to check how far away The Siren is, just to be sure those few corners may have cut him off a bit, and BAM! He's right in your face, his three demonic mouths, two where his eyes should be but vertical. An absolute terrifying character in his element! Love. It. [/spoiler] Vivo also contains many many hidden Easter Eggs, at almost every turn there's some reference, and Vivo does it with charm. But this charming setting doesn't fit the atmosphere, and once you get past the first 40 minuets or so the constant references run dry, which helps the game feel a lot more scary. The game also has many endings, some even a little humorous in a dark way, its great. I won't be mentioning any for the sake of spoilers and all, but its fun. Vivo even has other game modes, which is basically unheard of for a game of this almost awkward style. This spoiler isn't really relevant to the game, so even if you still plan to buy you should take a look unless you wanna get every little thing on your own. [spoiler] There is a game called midnight in which if you open Vivo at midnight in real time it will play the actual arcade style FPS. Its a great idea and I wish more games did this sorta thing. [/spoiler]   I placed my complaints above what I enjoyed so people could see why I left my review as well as leave this on a good note. I absolutely LOVE the IDEA of Lost in Vivo. But overall, this game has a lot of issues and almost looks like it could be worth $5.99 rather than an extreme double the price. It was a very meh to almost poor execution of what could have been a hidden gem or even what some would call an indie masterpiece. People are really hyping this game up because of a moderately famous YouTuber, Pyrocynical. So I completely understand if this review seems a bit different from most of the others but I have to be honest here. If this game was in early access for a few bucks less then it would be an instant hit. Fix the bugs, environment, enemies, sound... This list goes on and makes me really sad because this game is one of the few which will make its mark to keep the psychological horror genre alive. Here's hoping there's some fixes and Kira listens.      You saw a long review and skipped to the bottom, the game's neat but hugely flawed in ways most people won't say because of all the recent hype and revitalizing an old genre. It's a great concept but mediocre execution, which honestly disappoints me. :(
Looks like a PS1 game with a couple extra bells and whistles, but honest to god runs worse than PUBG. I'm on decent, modern hardware with all graphics and resolution set to low ingame. You have to put real effort into making a game run this poorly. I still remember the days when "optimization" was a word that game devs knew the meaning of.   Edit for the fanboys: The game itself is trash too. Gameplay is clunky and awful, pacing is done better in some childrens' games, enemy variety is shit, weapon balancing is shit, the "horror" aspect of the game is limited to boring, overdone, wannabe silent hill trash that's done by a new game every 3 seconds. I've seen everything this game does, done better in free games on itch.io, and they're usually less pretentious too.  Ngl, If you like this game, chances are you're an easily amused teenage hipster who desperately wishes they were born in the '90s. If that isn't an exact descriptor of you, then God help you.
Everything about this game has atleast 1 problem. Visuals have a good style but are a technical disaster with lack of anti-aliasing, no vsync when you play in fullscreen (it also crashes when you alt-tab, never had this problem with any other unity game, and i've played a countless amount of them), and lighting bugging out over short distances. You also can't change the fov which is absurdly low, have fun getting sick. Ambient sounds are good but guns are super quiet while enemies are unbelievably loud, even once the trains get their volume turned down it won't fix it, every single enemy is just absurdly noisy. Being obnoxious doesn't make something scary. Combat and level design both give each other problems so I'm going to just address them at the same time. At one point the game gives you a pistol, then gives you only 1 enemy type to use it on, this same enemy type damages you when it dies (which is awful enemy design) so as a result you avoid hurting them and just run instead. Then the game gives you a shotgun, so you barely even got to try out the pistol. Also weapons in these kinda games are usually meant to feel pretty significant but here getting the shotgun just made me wonder if maybe some other enemy or even maybe a boss was supposed to show up but didn't spawn, or that i missed it somehow. Also when you get the shotgun it's description says it "won't do much damage" and then proceeded to 1-shot everything i hit it with. 10/10 Also a particularly fun part is where a door that was fine before magically gets a lock on it while you're fleeing from more of those un-avoidable damage fellas, and you have to just stand there holding E to pick the lock while 1-shotting them as they do like 8 damage to you upon death, how scary. (and btw, you can only check your health in the menu, because knowing if you're about to literally die or not at a moment's notice is just unrealistic and would take you out of the immersion /s) Btw, the environment randomly changing is something that happens pretty often, it makes no sense and instead of being all weird and surreal it's just frustrating. There's a bit where you're riding a train to a station but just before it gets there spooky_sound.wav plays and the game drops you in the tunnel with the train nowhere to be found, only like 10 feet away from the station. That's not scary, it's annoying. Also on top of this the story just doesn't exist, there is just no story. You'll see a lot of weird stuff, and hear a lotta weird things, but there's no connection to or from any of it, it's a mess. (even the dog falling down into the sewer seems convoluted with how sudden and confusing it is. he was on the sidewalk just fine so why is he suddenly swept away into it by the rain? because video game) Also a couple sidenotes, the first save is nearly 10 whole minutes in, and you can get easily stuck on terrain before that. There's actually quite a lot of spots where you can easily just get stuck on terrain and have no choice but to restart.  Immersion-breaking technical issues, ear-bleeding obnoxious sound design, combat and enemies that make no sense, and a world and story that has no clue what it's doing. Yeah this game's a mess. Buried in here is something good but i don't think it's salvageable without like another year of polish.
The game was not scary exept for the occasional extreamly loud sound that are not affected by the volume setting. The story and gameplay are OK at best if you don't mind the random frame drops. I would try to get a refund but i took me 4 hours to complete.
This is just my desperate attempt of convincing you to stop looking at bad reviews as an excuse to not buy this game because you're obviously too scared to play it.  Buy it and if you don't like it, that's fine. But if you do like it, then why did you went that length of reading all the negative reviews just to make 100% sure you don't get cucked by the ammount of good reviews.  I tell you why. Because you are a smart person who doesnt just believe in the majority of people saying: "This is the best Horror game I've ever played!" and you know what, I respect that a lot.  I'm sorry for making you read all of my stupid bullshit and I hope you do enjoy the game, and like I said, if you don't that's fine. No one can force you to like a game.  Good god. Why am I still typing, SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE! I CAN'T STOP TYPING!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Though I do my best to support indie games I cannot recommend this game. It has a very VERY good silent hill vibe. The sounds and lighting are great. I felt like I was playing silent hill 2 in the beginning.   Unfortunately I ran into many jumpscares in the 20 min i played, and i realized that none of them were very well done. my tension soon fell to nothing and I just got bored. then some dogs in cages popped out and looked so bad that I couldn't stop laughing. at that point i decided that I would love to continue this game, but I refuse to pay more than a couple dollars for it.   I know the people who made this worked very hard on it, but this game is clearly not worth it's current price point. if they lower the price, or actually do something scary, then ill buy it again. If i see some updates I might even buy it again just to see if they fixed the issues. At its current state, however, there are better games that are free.
Overrated garbage  "Lets set up several plot threads then never address them lmao"
I [b] cannot recommend [/b] this game. My sister bought it for me because she watched a popular twitch personality stream it and apparently they all had a good time. I on the other hand did not have a good time.  If I had to sum up this game with one word it would be [b] SLOPPY [/b]. It tries to own that sloppiness with certain story elements and gameplay scenarios but sloppy is sloppy.  I only beat it because I wanted to feel justified criticizing this game and I was hoping something cool would happen eventually. There are some nifty moments but I was never scared and always bored. I should mention I'm not a story type of guy I prefer gameplay. If something happend because it was written somewhere I couldn't give a shit.  A couple of things might have made it more enjoyable for me. - Sledgehammer should've been end game weapon not available from the beginning. would've added more tension. - No enemies that can clip through walls. Maybe one special enemy would've been neat but at least 2 mob type enemies could clip. - More dynamic lighting. There are a few spots where light bleeds into a dark scene and it looks great but mostly it's pretty drably lit - Don't nerf the [spoiler] shotgun [/spoiler] w/ out eventually giving us a better [spoiler] shotgun [/spoiler]. It was kind of funny at first until it was lame.   I do hope this game developer makes more games, they have potential.
[h1] Lost in Translation [/h1]  Lost in Vivo is a tech demo at best; it is a proof of concept. A non-existant story, shoddy gunplay against twitchy enemies that are hard to hit, and bizarre glitches (and I am not even talking about the intentional ones that break the fourth wall) all serve to ruin a superbly crafted atmosphere, and ultimately the game itself.  Lost in Vivo tells the story of... someone, doing... something. Ostensibly you play as someone with claustrophobia, but that is never made clear in-game given your character dives right into a tight sewer to save a guide dog that I assume he is not too acquainted with. The game's events could just as easily be a fever dream, so if the developer does not care about his story then neither will I. Along the way you will aquire weapons with poor hit detection to fight spastic, annoyingly loud monsters which exist because why not, you will collect 'lost tapes' that do nothing and serve no purpose, and on a single occasion you will be guided by an angel who seems to take an interest in you/your dog because... just because! It is worth noting that Akuma Kira claimed to be inspired by "Dante's Inferno"- now whether Kira is talking about the 2010 video game, or the Divine Comedy is anybody's guess, because both of those clearly have no weight on the plot beyond a piece of graffiti that says 'abandon all hope, ye who enter here' and I am paraphrasing said graffiti with the correct text because I do not even think it accurately quotes the source material.  Akuma Kira is a talented artist with a vivid imagination, but a questionable writer who lacks the skill to manifest his vision. Unless the final product is his vision, in which case Kira is a hack. Kira could get away with plotholes, ambiguities and nonsensical story elements in Spooky's House of Jumpscares because that game is a gimmick and the plot is an excuse. That approach will not work with an atmospheric horror game: something which Lost in Vivo claims to be.  Kira's sheer artistic talent alone is the only reason I will not crap on this game in its entirety, but it is not enough to convince me that money should be spent on a tech demo.
How this "game" got a high rating is beyond me. This is a dull game. Like, visiting your grand-parents boring. You will mostly walk forwards in similar looking corridors. Do not trust the trailers, they only show seconds-long clips of "entertaining" parts of the game. These parts are so few in between, I forgot there was enemies in the game, until they actually gave me a pistol, and nothing to shoot at for another couple of minutes.  Also, there are no animations for enemies, even the dog at the start of the game has only 2 moving legs. Then when you see him again he just slides away from you while facing you... sitting down...  This is one of the worst games I've played recently, refunded, thanks Gaben's
Not bad,not good either,I kind of expected more tbh,best way to describe it is like having blue balls,its like u expect it to be amazing but its just okay and then you realize you're halfway through and you still dont feel satisfied. Also the enemy A.I. is really wonky and unstable,the scp monster part felt more like a gamble than an actual fight for my life. Overall it left me kind of empty,I was really hoping for a silent hill experience and it was pretty close to being okay.  Kind of wish I could refund it...
Before I start Ive played it up to the apple part  its about an hour something in game. And I must say I dont like it...  I dont mind the poor graphics those arent everything. Actualy the start of the game seemed really strong and intresting but at some point around subway level game just turn in to a very poor game. Enemies would not hit/hit you hard to say it doesnt really indicate it half of the time. Most of the enemies clip thru objects. When your attacked by a train and you see how it moves around you find it more silly then scary.... When the game started spawning monsters it became a funny adventure and then it turned in to a sad one sadly as it seemed really pitiful and not scary at that point. Even the atmospheric effects went away from what Ive noticed.  I cant recomend this. If they kept the tone of the first part of the game Id be all over it... wierd creepy stuf over monsters all over the place
Man, I really want to like this game, but it has a couple things that completely ruin it for me. Firstly is the sound mixing. Some enemies are so loud that I have to take my headphones off to progress. This could be completely fixed by adding a sound mixer with ambient noise, enemies, music, and other gameplay sounds separate. Instead, I have to choose between being able to hear ambient noise and music or being able to hear at all. Secondly, and maybe my game is glitched because this seems like a huge oversight, but I can't find any indicator of health. I tried to verify my game cache to make sure, but it says my game isn't missing anything. I can fight a wave of enemies and walk away with no sign of how injured I am, so I die immediately to the next enemy I see and have to go back to the last save room to do it all over again.  I love the atmosphere of this game and it is really intriguing to me, but with these sound and health issues, it makes the game practically unplayable. The game becomes impossible to get immersed in, which is the primary aspect of a horror game like this. I'll come back in a few months. Hopefully then I can take this review down and enjoy the game.
The Game was okay, until I reached a part in a metro, with screaching Trains. The Sound was so unbarebly loud, I think about sueing the Developer for Mayhem.  Here is a Clip to show what I am talking about: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/353177974
I have very mixed views on this game; it seems like for everything I liked there were either a bug or a questionable design choice to counteract it.   The most reoccurring bug I have come across is that sometimes you tend to get stuck on certain surfaces. After the train station I found it hard to get onto the platform consistently. I also fell through the map once there, however this appears to have been patched since. The enemies appear to not have collision...like at all. I found myself having to constantly turn around because the monster went through me to attack from behind. More than once did I get pushed back and confused by my surroundings because a monster pushed me as it went through me. Going into monsters was also not uncommon. Textures would spaz with lighting over distances, no matter what graphics setting I set the game to.  Now unto design choices. The main complaint I would have with this game is its lack of consistancy. It's supposed to be a pixelated game however some textures look almost HD. You can see what I mean with the first enemy; his face is finely detailed, you can see every wrinkle and drip of blood. Then on top is low polygon hair that looks like it belongs in a game from the early 90's. Your dog looks so good no matter what the graphics setting, but maggots are just squares. It honestly took me back looking at a bunch of squares coming out of what is clearly a broken television. Honestly the game feels like an asset flip, however I know it's not.  Transitions between levels are really rough around the edges. Granted I have never been on a subway before, but I am fairly certain that they do not connect to sewers...like at all. Then later you just enter a mine. That's it. You see a hole in a railroad track and you go in and suddenly you're in a mine. Then after that its an underground research facility. If you think there is a reason why all these places are connected, you're asking too much from the game. Vivo feels like a movie that gets lost in its subplots and loses meaning in the main storyline.  Speaking of the research facility, there is a "boss" there that is just SCP-173. When it ends there's a fakeout credit roll and more levels. Not a major problem but these are too common of tropes to even scare me anymore, and I doubt anyone else playing this game found it scary either. It's just disappointing.   Honestly there are so many little things that I could keep going, however there are some aspects of this game that I actually liked. As I mentioned earlier, the game looks amazing at first. The streets are reflecting light when wet, the walls of the sewer reflect light off of every brick, and your doggo is just adorable. I also like some of the monster designs, especially the dog mimic, which actually scared me at first. The game goes on this one tangent early on that has a sort of PT feel after a fakeout boss, which is supposed to be about bulimia. I ADORED this section of the game and honestly wish that more of Vivo was like that. Exploring the ideas behind mental illnesses and just going through the metaphors of bulimia or any other mental illness would make for a really interesting game, and I am distraught that the game did so little with it.  Overall I think that this game has a lot of potential, however it has so many faults that I cannot recommend at this time. Akuma, I think you lost the meaning of this game along the way somewhere. I get that Vivo is supposed to be a nod to Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but honestly the game works as an atmospheric horror way better than it does an action horror. I will be sure to revisit this title in time, hopefully that will make the experience better.  Edit: It has come to my attention that the monsters lacking any collision was an intentional design choice. My bad. However this does not change my opinion as it's still annoying as Hell.  ADDENDUM: After a few months I got back to this game with a better gaming rig. I see my lighting complaint has been addressed., alongside some improved modeling. However many of the questionable design choices have remained unchanged, and now I have more to add.  So many people have told me that the monsters with no collision are supposed to be hallucinations or that the world isn't real. I'd be fine with that, honestly, if the game wasn't literally called Lost in Vivo. If everything is fake, that only adds up more questions for me and makes the story more and more nonsensical. If everything is staged, as hinted by the computer errors and the dialogue, then, again, it's not in Vivo.  TL;DR: The way I see it, either the entire experience is supposed to be real or its fake/staged/the character hallucinating/whatever. If real, then it's nonsensical, if fake, then it's not in vivo, which not only contradicts the title, but contradicts what the developer himself has said about the game.  Also as a preemtive strike against comments that will say "oh it's just a story dude, chill out", may I bring your attention to Spooky's Jumpscare mansion? The story there is fairly watertight for what it's worth, and I don't think I can really poke any holes in it at this point. This story is just more and more confusing the more I think about it, and with the serious undertones and lovely visuals Vivo has to offer I feel like I would be doing the game an injustice to not pay attention to the story, no matter how mind-boggling it is. The premise is simple and clear, but the more I dig into it, the less sense it seems to make.  Also one minor but painfully blatant nitpick that I also had with my first runthrough, the whistle mechanic. Not only is it only useful in one section of the game, (and "useful" is stretching it, you can get past it with a little patience and memory) but it doesn't make sense for a service dog, who would be trained to listen to you and you only. Unless it's just a therapy dog, but I'm fairly certain that I heard Akira say that it's a service dog. Either that or it's not a very good service dog to begin with. If it turns out to just be a therapy dog, then I rescind my complaint.  Overall, I still would not recommend this game. If you're the kind of player that just likes fetch quests and scares, then go on ahead; If you care about story, then move on amigo, spend your money elsewhere.
This game is completely unplayable due to the fact you can't invert the x-axis. How difficult is it to put this feature in a game? Anyway. If you must invert the x-axis DO NOT buy this game.
This game starts off great. It's a pixelated horror with weird and unique(ish) mechanics and experiences with a great sound design to evoke the 'creepy' feeling. That being said, after the first hour, the game starts to crumble into what many bad horror games do, which is become an action game that is no longer scary. At a 3 hour gameplay time, I highly recommend the first hour, then shut down the game and don't touch it again.  (Almost) Full playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=503tV4UMh44
Do not buy this. Could probably be very fun except it crashes multiple times a turn.
[i] To read the full review, find it over at [url=https://saveorquit.com/2019/03/26/review-chromatic-aberration/] Save or Quit! [/url] [/i]  [h1] Chromatic Aberration is a Pixel-Art Action Shooter that tries to be a “Doom Clone” but just falls short of standing out. [/h1]  Chromatic Aberration touts itself as a single-player action orientated Pixel-Art shooter with fast combat, bullet-hell enemies, and satisfying weapons. It uses a mix of 2D sprites in a 3D environment and says it is inspired by great games such as Doom, Duke3D, Megaman and influenced by an age where there was no “First Person Shooter” but games instead called “Doom clones”. Does Chromatic Aberration have what it takes to be worthy of a classic FPS? Let’s find out!  What first drew me to Chromatic Aberration, other than saying it’s a classic FPS, was the graphical choice. I thought it looked pretty interesting from the screenshots and even after I started playing, I enjoyed the graphic style immensely. The game does have some different “styles” that you can choose from the options, but you can’t do it while in game. You have to go to the main menu each time you want to change it, jump in the game, and quit back to the menu to change it. It is kind of annoying when I wanted to see what each thing did and how it changed it, but I just ended up turning it all off for how annoying that was. Once you are in the game though, some levels look very well built and interesting, then some just feel boring and slapped together. I found it to be a mixture of some great areas, then the next would be an ugly and boring cave. The city areas do look nice, and have lots of neon-like esthetics. At one point there is even a lovely forest area with autumn colors, though it’s ruined with the city skybox. The worst areas, though, are the caves as they just feel like they were strung together. These are definitely the most boring levels in the game, as they feel the least creative, and all the same.  The biggest mistake that Chromatic Aberration makes when trying to be a retro FPS is in its level design and secret areas. This game does not have ANY secrets hiding in the game, at least that I’ve been able to find. If a game claims to be a retro FPS, you have to have what made retro FPS games great, fantastic level design that allows for exploration and cool secrets to find. Chromatic Aberration sadly doesn’t provide that satisfaction. ________________  The music selection is OK, though nothing really stands out as being memorable. There is no set music for each level, it’s on a track list that rotates as you enter a new map or reload a save. The levels don’t have sounds to them, at least for anything that you can notice. The weapon sounds are decent and are passable. The enemies don’t have very many sound effects though, as all the cyborg enemies sound the same. The others have some different audio, but it does not vary all that much. The enemies don’t have any sound effects when they are moving other than the cyborgs where they have what is sort of a “jumping” sound.  he weapons you will be using in your adventure range from a pistol, SMG, shotgun, mini-gun, flamethrower, and possibly a few other weapons, though I wouldn’t know as I never finished the game (which I’ll explain later.) The issue is that once you pick up a new weapon, you don’t really want to use the last weapon as they just feel underpowered and useless, especially against the tougher enemies further into the game. The pistol starts to take more shots to kill, as with the SMG, and so on. Some weapons, on the other hand, tend to be helpful for certain enemies. For example, the shotgun tends to be very helpful when dealing with the tanks. Compare this to the flamethrower which doesn’t seem to work very well against the tanks, but will melt through every other enemy with no problem. When you kill a cyborg, they explode in nice pixelated gibs… even with just a simple pistol. It’s funny at first, but after a while it loses its charm. ________________  The health, however, is a completely different story! As you play through the game you can pick up health packs, which don’t add a whole lot of health, but that’s fine as the game is supposed to play like a bullet hell. The problem is that not every map has health packs! Yes, I’m dead serious! You don’t even have to wait long to find out, as the second level puts you through this! There are levels that just won’t have a single health pack, so you have to save scum the entire level because you can’t afford to take damage through it. There were a few levels that I scraped by with just a sliver of health left. Once you get to the next area you get full health again, but then it usually mocks you and spawns a few health packs in the next level right at the start. This lack of health packs has happened three times for me and once I reached that third time, I just dropped the game.  Most of the enemies have a bullet projectile and are pretty easy to dodge. The cyborg enemies are fairly easy to kill depending on what kind of weapon they have. They will have a single shot, 3-shot, or shoot multiple shots. As you progress you will fight against drones and even spider-like creatures. There are also bosses in this game, with one boss being a big tank in a large arena room with lots of cover and ammo. The other boss fight was against another big tank and an APC that spawns drone enemies, though it’s in an open room with no cover at all but does provide a fun bullet hell style boss fight.  The worst enemies, however, are the Purple Tanks. Not only do they shoot missiles that explode, but they also have a hitscan shot that you can NOT dodge! You also don’t get a warning about the shot either. On top of that, the Tank deals a lot of damage. It took me a while to figure out why I was being damaged when there were no bullets flying, till I saw the tank shoot me. What’s even more annoying are that the explosions in this game are not consistent in splash damage. Sometimes I can be right beside the explosion and not take damage, then the next time I could be around a corner and take full damage. The tanks also explode when they die, and this sucks as these tanks become a common enemy and are even placed in small places. Combine this with the lack of health in some maps, and it makes things extremely difficult to the point where you have to save scum if you take too much damage. There is one problem though.  The game give you three save slots… or in other words, three different playthroughs that you can have at one time. The problem is that each save slot is only one single save. What do you mean? Well, the game has autosaves, a quick save/load option, and a manual save/load option. The problem is these ALL share the same save slot!! As I mentioned earlier, quite a few maps have no health packs so you will be save scumming to avoid most damage to make it through the game. The issue is, if you happen to save in a bad spot then that’s that, your game is toast! There isn’t an option to restart the level either, your entire game is stuck to the one save file.

[/url] [/i] [/h1]  So with all that, the lack of health, cheap attacks the Tanks use, and ruining a save yet again, this is where my third attempt ended. Only now I have no plans on going through it all again. In the end, I felt bored and didn’t feel like finishing it, which is a real shame. I was looking forward to it, but with how the game is structured to be both extremely repetitive and linear, it just didn’t make it fun for very long. The game is painfully average. If you truly want to try out the game, then I’d say wait for a sale.
A run and gun gore shooter at its core with some storytelling elements.  You pick up new guns which are better than the previous gun you had and move forward and kill.  It's a tried and true model of FPS game and it has its own minecraft-esque graphics which aren't awful.  The multiple layers of configuration options while simultaneously having a limited set of things actually configurable are maddening.  The camera lean on strafe cannot be disabled and all 3 layers of configuration must be in perfect harmony or the game becomes unplayable.  Checking the forums this game has been abandoned by the dev as well so do not expect it to be updated to remedy these issues.
Feels clunky to move about and throw nades, and gear is strangely placed on your body, and it makes shit hard to use. Will try again once its out of early access.
Performance is bad
Not very clear on how certain things work, Low player count, Mic system is off, Not very helpful people, Equipment is placed oddly on body hard to grab certain gear, not very good loadout system. I had hopes for this game but it is not what I expected.
this game is just uncomfortable to play on wmr
Once the game gets started it's "okay" but the load up is a sickening slap of disorientation and screen tearing. Tried it because it's on sale but apparently my 1080 just can't handle Contractors level of awesomeness. I will say once the game gets going it gets a lot better but by that time you're nursing a motion sick hangover big enough to choke a cow.
This game is worse than pavlov. The controls are horrible and just poorly thought and laid out. I played on a Samsung Odyssey (Windows mixed reality) and had an awful experience. The recoil is awful and using sights is close to impossible.   Also very few if any servers were up(none showed up for me).      I DO NOT RECOMMEND  this game at all
Great game if they’d return the world record number to the shooting range. A lot of the fun can come from trying to get to that number. I hold the record for one of them. Will amend rating when that’s fixed!!
Contractors VR has bad controls, bad sound, and bad hit registration. Anyone who recommends this game over Pavlov VR is a certified fool.   It's truly remarkable how these developers have found a way to make the simple act of aiming a gun difficult. If you can even manage to point your gun at an enemy, it's likely all of your shots will miss as ridiculous recoil patterns combined with an inaccurate IK system with severe input lag makes aiming near impossible for anyone not already acclimated to Contractors VR.  The sound in this game is so terrible that I'm not even certain it's in stereo. It doesn't matter if someone's in front, behind, above or below you, it all sounds the same.  Even looking past all that, the broken hit registration makes every death feel unfair. No matter how many walls I put between me and whatever wishes to harm me, I'll still die because on their screen I never moved.  There is absolutely NO reason to buy this game over Pavlov VR. Seriously.
PREFACE: I think the issues i'm experiencing are due to the Rift S being new to the market, introducing unique bugs.  Neat looking game with some solid gun controls. Presence feels nice and control feedback is as good as could be expected from a game so early in development. There are some great guns available with a few customizations here and there, but nothing that breaks the wheel so to speak. ---- Now for the bad. I can't keep this game on for more than 5 minutes without a hard crash. I've messed with every setting available and just at random, the game will seize up blacking out the headset rendering all vr controls useless with a frozen mirror screen on the physical desktop. All that can be done is a manual close irl. I've tried several methods of reproducing the issue and the most common source seems to be full-auto firing a gun with a scope close to the eye, but semi-auto has resulted in the same problem if the trigger is pulled at a reasonable rate.  For most headsets, this seems to run fine, but at least in my case on the rift s, i cant keep the game open long enough to, well, play the game. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on it though as it seems promising but will need some focused bug fixing as the second generation of headsets enter the market.
i was expecting lag but it was realy smooth, felt like every thing was in right place, havnt played long casue i got stuff to do but i can see my self playing this alot, runs better then pavlov it feels but i aint played pavlov much recently so meh but i just prefered this  my rig is i5 4690 970 4gig sli vive standard 32g ddr4  was playing fine i was killing people, was good fun, so if your on the fence worrying if itll run or not id say go for it  edit, still great but the fact there is people useing xbox controllers instead of the hand controllers is gonna kill the game, u cant out aim some one sat useing a control pad, please fix this, its either u get off ur as and play or bugger off, gonna put it as no, casue i might be wrong devs if u wana set me straight please do love the game wanna see it do well, why im voicing concerns
i love everything about this game but if I literally can not play it then i can't give it a positive score. game is dead as fuck
I'm not really sure what I should say, I've played for a solid 32 minutes and this is what I noticed:  The Game Runs pretty decently on a 1060 6gb/i3 8100 on medium - high settings Game has a very low population. I find my self having to strain my wrists to look down the sights Movement is quite clunky compared to Onward Gun mechanics are great Graphics are great.  I wouldn't recommend this game in this stage because it feels like you're playing black ops 4, unfinished and poopy.  This review is my first notices about the game and I will change the review to positive if I find more things I like.
It pains me to write a negative review of this game as I've been playing it from the beginning but it's just yet another early access VR game that's making progress at a snails pace and is even worse in some aspects than launch.   For starters, the positives - Graphics of everything but the character model are awesome. The levels especially look great for the most part. The only thing I hate is how the body and hands look so weirdly disproportionate (the hands especially). - Shooting mechanics are great - Nice variety of weapons - Core game mechanics are solid  Negatives: - Game runs like ass. On my 1080ti/4790k I regularly get slow down and stutter. This seems to have got a lot worse lately. - Servers are dead for the most part. You might be lucky in the evenings and find a game or two but that's about it. - I've had a number of occasions where games have been ruined by cheaters - This has THE WORST of AI implementation in a shooter I have ever seen in my life. I tried it for the first time today and picked one of the bigger Maps. put the max (only 10) AI enemies and set it to the hardest difficulty. After walking forward for 20 seconds, literally all 10 enemies just rushed at me in a straight line at the same time. Absolutely ridiculous. Why bother even putting it in the game if you're going to do it this lazily.   I could go on but I think you get the point. Like I said, it pains me to write this review as I had exceptionally high hopes for this game when it first came out but I really just can't recommend it in it's current state and I have no faith that it's going to be improved much given the incredibly slow progress from the devs and the steady decline in players. Such a shame.
Seems like a neat game but there is currently ZERO people playing. It's not even on the top 10 population online VR Games and you know that's saying something. Stay away until the devs do something about the online population
DONT BUY!!! the devs need to fix the lock server bull shit players hide behind a code and dont wanna get that ass smacked
Doesn't work. Game stutters very heavily despite high end specs and i keep getting kicked out of servers without warning after about 2 minutes on them. Gunplay seems like fun but can't really enjoy that. Refund requested.
I dont know, I don't like it, there isn't really a reason.
I can't recommend  this game to many people, its a weird mix of slow and fast paced. I also found it very difficult to find a lobby in this game. If your looking for a slower more tactical VR shooter buy onward. If you want a fast paced VR shooter play Pavlov. Don't buy this game.
I understand why people in vr are playing with locked rooms.
I'm comparing this game to Onward and Pavlov, since I play them both regularly.  I wanted to like this, but It doesn't feel as polished as Pavlov and even Onward at the moment. Looks like It's pretty dead already as well. There's only one full server at best, but that's not always the case. I had to play against bots yesterday, and It really wasn't enjoyable.  I like the change of pace compared to other VR shooters I have played. This is definitley not the most realistic shooter out there, but teamwork is still important. This might suit you if you feel like Onward is too slow, but this is one of the reasons It doesn't feel nearly as immersive as other games. Peeking around corners and running to cover doesn't feel the same, because there is no real danger. You die, you respawn. This is not the case in Onward and Pavlov, and that's why firefights feel much more immersive as well, because everything you do feels risky. That's just not the case in Contractors.  The graphics are good, however this did not add to the immersion compared to Onward and Pavlov in my opinion. The sliding mechanic feels awesome, and it fits the pace of the game.  Your controllers vibrate when you move, and It feels kinda unatrual to me, however It isn't a really an issue.  The game is ok, but It's not worth the price at the moment. I'm gonna be optimistic though, and I hope it gets better with future updates.
NEED AUSTRALIAN SERVERSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Game offers a lot more customisation & availability of weapons than the VR-Shooter greats, Pavlov & Onward, but equally it lacks the smoothness, ability to play offline, and the majesty you'd expect from a VR: with Contractors with my Oculus Rift felt disgusting to say the least as frame-rate was inconsistent, and lag. Player-models and map details seem equally as basic and unoptimized.
GAM IS NOOT FUN, NO RECCOMEND!!!
if you have a gunstock and a pimax, you'd probably enjoy  PROBLEM 1  maps are to long. lets be real, the oculus has a shitty rez, and you cant see anything more than 7 meters in front of you. Now in this game, all your enemies are at least 100 meters away, and maybe if your lucky, 4 pixels.  PROBLEM 2 maps are kinda shitty. So, there is a wall, there is a hole in that wall, you think "hmm this would be a good spot to go through" so you crouch irl and try to go through, and invisible wall. You see open windows at the factory, maybe i'll throw a gernade in! annddd invisible wall that blocks the gernade.  PROBLEM 3 It's hard to find matches. now if you're playing at peak times, you can probably find a kinda full match in like 10 mins, but if not, get ready for 300 ping bullshit.  now, there are some good things to the game  - It supports gun stocks - has nice weapon handling and realistic physics -you can throw your knives -there is a radio on your arm to communicate with team mates across the map -graphics are pretty good -People in the game are really nice 
It is terrible when it comes down to active players (for me at least) since I keep getting the same players who have played the game for ages and no one else plays
I don't recommend this game. The multiplayer is essentially dead with the all time peak at 175 and currently at the time of writing this review, the 24 hour peak was 60 players. During my 2 hours of play time I searched for lobbies but only found 2 or 3 with 2 players at most in those lobbies. If you're looking to shoot guns in VR. I recommend Hot Dogs Horseshoes and Hand Grenades (H3VR). Its fun, its the same price and everything about it is just better, only thing is, there's no multiplayer for H3VR. If you're looking for something with guns and multiplayer, then I recommend Pavlov VR. Pavlov has a thriving player count with over 500 players online every day. They even have a demo so you can try it out. That's currently what I'm going to buy with my refund. All of this information is written as of March 20th 2019. Player count could have drastically changed since writing this review.
Its a good game. BUT! There is a lot of cheters in it. MP is unplayable and there is always one or two that is BS!
I can run SkyrimVR with all the 4k textures at 500% resolution. This game at 100% stutters, and the loading screen flashes every 2 seconds. Unplayable.  Can't play long enough to even calibrate my hands so that my gun-stock lines up.   Wish I didn't miss the refund-window on this one. Money in the toilet.
Didn't work for me, I spawned without guns every time.
Its a fun game with fun mechanics, you should at least try it out yourself, however the multiplayer community is filled with the most BS tryhards you will ever meet, you shoot a whole magazine in them, they kill you in one shot. every. time. without fail. even if it's not a head shot. ive been shooting at players in the head and nothing, red puffs and no kills. they look at me once im dead in an instant.  it's a good idea of a game, just play with friends. the online multiplayer are nothing but tryhards and campers.
garbage
The game has awesome maps, the game play is fun and the player base is pretty cool. However, I am changing my review to a negative because of some goofy attitudes held by the community and the moderators.  You see they programmed in a height calibration feature(which is awesome and functions as intended). However, since I'm old and play seated I calibrated to my sitting height. The moderators and some of the players go on endlessly about how this is a mild exploit. Then they started a competitive league and my own teammates were trying to convince me to artifically lower floor, or set it so I couldn't run or whatever. By calibrating myself to be short I can effectively play sitting, run etc, but since im short I cant see over walls, and have to rely on snap turn(which in and of it self should balance being smaller, but the community doesn't agree).They have a great game on their hands with great mechanics including the calibration. Everything is balanced at the moment but I feel that will shift as more players complain one way or another. Didn't want to deal with the drama being related to being accused of cheating or even forced to sit out on matches with my own team. So Thumbs up goes to thumbs down. Wish you guys best of luck tho.
Awful controls, terrible AI, terrible sighting on the guns. After all the great shooters in VR, I don't need to remember yet another new way to eject and replace a magazine. Just do what the others do please. I'll stick with those games.
The same amount of players as counter-strike competetive matches but maps that are 5 times larger. Fucking ASS
It's a good game, with plenty of scope to get better, the problem is, the servers are being hacked by people who are using snipers one handed as Uber pistols, and that's if you can get as far as the actual game. For the last week, I have not been able to connect to a game server, keep getting kicked back to the training room. I have reported this, but no response from the devs.  Meanwhile, on the same system, without a restart of any application like steam or Oculus, Pavlov VR works flawlessly.   So, might be good, one day, but not at the moment. If you enjoy playing solo against bots, then you can get this and be fine to play, but if you want to play against other people, then it's a crap shoot if you will be able to connect to a server or not. 
Still has a lot of work ahead but is pretty good.  Wouldnt pay the full price for this and the tracking issues need to be sorted.  Offline bots needs to be adjusted as they are too dumb and you cant play an actual game mode with them, its just you running around in an infinite team deathmatch with no real purpose.
TRASH
trash
absolutely abyssmal  it forces you the recalibrate your hight but it simply doesnt work  the manuall calibration lets you go up to 210 cm but it kept saying i would have to raise my height calibration, auto calibration put the value up to 218 but didnt work either.... i am 172 cm tall..... i literally had to lay down on the floor and tpose to get past the calibration only to find that im a giant who cant even grab his gear without bending over irl, touching the ground was impossible
Ehhhh, I bought into this due to youtube videos and steam reviews all praising how amazing this game is, mostly hearing if you like pavlov and onward then you'll love this as it feels somewhere in the middle. More serious than pavlov, less serious than onward. In the time I played, it didn't feel like pavlov at all, it just felt like onward with some different modes, I didn't really feel anything pavlov in it, just felt serious outside of TDM I suppose. Visually the game does look great, weapon wise though was where things felt odd. Lots of guns which is great, however adding sights on various guns didn't feel right, as in it appeared the red dot wasn't centered but rather sat somewhere lower on the lens, so I would kinda tilt my gun an odd way down to try and align it. This wasn't the issue with all guns however, for clarity I have played a couple of VR shooters and never have red dots, scopes, or iron sights felt off or not aligned right, just in this game. Community didn't leave a very good first impression either, very serious quick to rage at you dick kind of players, just got the game, don't know the maps yet and have them freaking out not doing well enough or knowing which ways I could use to flank them. Not chill at all like the pavlov community. Death comes very quickly in this game as well, especially from people using a gun stock on their controllers as it takes away the work of having to align you're weapons sights. Gun recoil on a few weapons seemed pretty absurd, 2 shots on full auto would make the gun jump so high, even while holding the grip down, just too much. Maps are few and pretty boring as well.  TLDR: If you like onward, you'll probably like this game. If you primarily like how chill pavlov is, you probably won't enjoy the pacing, gunplay, or community of this game, I personally didn't feel anything pavlov esque here.  PS low play time so I could refund still.
If you have window Vr don't buy this game, can't detect my height and lose track of the arms while playing, waste of money.
Not even close to enough content compared to Pavlov VR. Needs workshop support, more game modes. Experiencing ingame voice chat is not so good.
Unfortunetly i exhausted most of the content within my small play time! With the long Q times and Lack of players its at best a 5/10
Controls are very clunky, wielding a gun is just confusing (keybindings are ugh, terrible) and overall the game feels like it was made for the Vive, I'm an Oculus player and you really feel this game wasn't made for Oculus in first place.  Gameplay's alright but not very polished, of course the videos shown look very pretty but with the HMD on it's a whole different story. Game has potential but it is definitely an Early Access, I'm refunding this game and will wait for a more polished, full version instead. Then I'll try this game again and possibly change my mind.  Also multiplayer was... pretty empty.
not great
Throw this one on the ever growing pile of VR games that couldnt get the controls right. Add in the fact that they didnt learn from Arizona Sunshines initial mistakes and made the iron sights impossible to see, even on the vive pro.  To the developers... Current generation VR is not the star trek holodeck. You have to change a lot of things to make it more comfortable and enjoyable. Gameplay is king. Make the sights bigger, glowy, whatever you have to do. The iron sights cannot consist of 3 pixels. You also need to fix your gun holder calibration. 90% of the time it puts in the offet in the opposite direction. I will tilt the rifle down, save, then draw the gun and it points even farther up at the ceiling. Also for the love of god make the offset global. It is utterly asinine that you expect me to go through the menu start to finish for each and every weapon to make an offset.  You also REALLY need to make a seated mode. You already have snap turning. all you need is a hight offset to make the player ~15 inches taller, that can be toggled on and off with controls to simulate crouching.  You also need to make up your mind whether you want the grip button to grab, or the trigger to grab. You cannot arbitrarily switch between the two for different items.
Tried on WMR and I couldn't get past the height configuration. Don't know why this is needed but very annoying! Tried chanbging heights around multiple times and it still didn't work. Waiting for fixes to it...
Coming from many other types of VR shooters, Contractors has one of the worst control schemes i've ever played with in the history of my time in VR. It's also not about rebinding either, the movement is clunky and the binds are terrible. If you are new to VR however and haven't gotten familiar with any other kind of shooter with different controls I would recommend this game, especially for the price.
Being a VR game the most important thing for me is the feeling and control of the guns, this was a deal breaker for me, it just didnt feel natural at all, i was constantly dropping my guns.. its just horrible.   
Buy Onward or Pavlov instead.
Could be so great, but it fails at a simple but crucial thing and is essentially unplayable for me.  I use a gunstock with all VR shooters.  This one has a great calibration mode but is unfathomably flawed.  You can control exactly where each individual gun rests on your shoulder, the elevation and pitch.  A little cumbersome to set up for every gun in the game, but ultimately should be awesome once set up.  However, you can't touch the front of the gun in calibration mode.  No foregrip, no shroud, nothing.  This means that when you're actually holding a gun with both hands, it is pointed in a completely different direction!!!  What is the point of the calibration then??  It's so far off, that when I'm holding my rifle with both hands, I'm pointing at the ground!  I'm not even close to seeing the red dot!  This means that to play the game I have to aim my RL gunstock like 15-20 degrees up in the air to see my sight.  It completely breaks the game for me, and I can't understand how such an obvious oversight made it this far.  I've tried changing the aim way up in the calibration, but I haven't been able to get it to work.  I just give up.
Maps are too big for the player count, you end up running half the map just to end up dead and  have to run all the way back to the 2-4 other people in the server. Maps need to be smaller.
Unfortunately I plan to return this game.  Despite what people say, this game is definitely not for casual shooter fans. While I enjoy the return of an arena shooter, the balance between weapons is extremely broken, most of the time resulting in myself dying in only one or two hits following a 15-second waiting time to try again. It takes me a miracle to down my enemy when returning fire. I met no users to assist me or teach me further how the game works, since the tutorial mode is lackluster.  I don't expect any competitive FPS games to hold my hand at all, but this is probably the worst I've experienced so far in terms of community, and terms of gameplay. Waiting to respawn is too agonizing, and there's only a total of six maps between the two gamemodes (as of Jan 2019).  There's a lot of aspects of this game that can easily be fixed, mostly with weapon and health balancing, but this is not a game for those who are new to shooter games, or have zero patience.
really not worth it
This is somewhere in between onward and pavlov both of which do the "vr first person shooter" very well.  its a well made game its just missing something, it didnt click , make me want to play more  if you want a more serious, organised, team based shooter buy onward  if you want a death match, run and gun shooter buy pavlov    
more like, "contract bores"...
As it stands now the game needs some work. As it stands I do like that it plays like a faster version of Onward; I was never a fan of Pavlov so its nice to stick more to the realism end of things without having to wait 10 minutes after early deaths. However right now there need to be some balancing fixes, currently most control points are far too defendable with lots of overlooking sniper points meaning whichever team makes it to an objective first typically has it much easier to take. Also upon the end of round teams aren't reballanced, meaning if you are paired against a good team you will continue to lose against them for as long as you stay on the server. Mechanics wise the guns are responsive though their sound effects leave a lot to be desired, with some like the M16 sounding properly loud while the AK sounds like a pea shooter; additionally sound propogation is increadibly short and at longer distances you cannot even hear gunshots or explosions. Also though I'm sort of glad there is no jump button as this would surely lead to bunnyhopping, there were a couple moments where I became stuck in something on the map with no way to escape (aside from suicide).  Also the game doesn't seem well designed towards playing with friends: though the party system is a nice addition there is no way to mute players or yourself in-game which would be nice for those who prefer to use discord.
This game seemded like it would be fun, But there is nobodey playing it. I got it hoped on messed around with the guns for a bit felt pretty solid. went to get into a game, It auto joined me with 1 person on the other team that was AFK. Thought this was a mistake went to server brouser. There was 2 full games (5 people one each team) and the one game i joined with one person it it. Nobodeys playing it wouldent recomend definitily would be a wast of 20 dollors but im refunding it.
While I don't even have 1 hour into the game, this shouldn't undermind what I will say.  First off, I plan on doing a refund because this game mainly didn't live up to it's expectations, or at least of what I saw out of the trailer. The trailer makes it look like as if it was more like the game Onward, so I expected that the game would have similar aspects to it. But nope, it's just like the game COD but VR. Everyone is just running around and shooting.  Now for the more technical aspects of this review: As I have said that I was expecting this game to feel more like onward. This means on how the gun handeling and movement of the game is like. Which, in my opinion, Onward has kinda set the standard on how a FPS VR game should feel like. In terms of gun handeling and movement, of course.   In this game, Contractors, the guns feel more cluncky and how your body reacts to you moving doesn't feel right. Especially looking down to see an entire vest blocking your view. Which I know that is how it would be like in real life, but this is VR and it kinda makes me get the uncanny feeling (aka doesn't feel right) that would make me get more of a closed in feeling than it being part of my body. Also, sometimes the vest just gets in the way of my view, despite the fact that I have callibrated my height.  I understand that this is an early acess game, but it is no excuse to not have a refund when the core of the game doesn't live up to the expectations of it's own trailer.
old review:   The combat is quite fun but the only issue that i have with the game is its litterally running simulator 2019. Once you die you wait for like 12 seconds, then you can respawn but you have to run a lot to get to the objective. The maps feel way too big for a 5v5 game (altough ive heard of talk of expanding player count). I have had more enjoyment with the christmas matches as they are fast paced and the maps are smaller.   Also seeing claymores in vr is awesome except they barely work, they work better on yourself then on enemies.  Yes I recommend this game as the development is going good and there should be more players/smaller maps for more combat.  new review:  the game has a good concept, except it is in very early access.  The map design is terrible and feels one sided, claymores in this game are utterly useless, they are easily seen, have very, VERY small range, and you have to be 1 millimeter close to it for it to actually kill you  its impossible to know where youre getting shot from, muzzle flashes are very dim, sound isnt clear enough because of long range, and theres no hit direction indicator. the orange circle on your hud doesnt work at all btw.  for 17 euro this game isnt worth it now, but im hoping devs improve these issues.
this game bad lol
REVIEWED ON THE HTC VIVE The game is one of the best VR shooters, but the bugs destroy it.  I played it for about 30 minutes and encoutered a bug that made me unable to move 5 times. In a shooter game, it's very problematic that you will be unable to move just because of a bug, so unfortunately I am forced to give it a "Not recommended". Final score: 6/10. 
Horrible Lag
pro: - graphics are decent - nice variety of tools like claymores - can play alone vs bots  con: - no coop - matches are never ending respawn fests, unlike rainbow six / onward style - no box/drum mags  - items on body get in the way often, too high up  Can't find anything better than Onward in VR.
nobody talks, everybody just runs straight to the middle of the map just like COD. coming from playing Onward, the movement and gun handling isnt smooth at all. the heavy vest blocks your view if you look down a tiny bit, forget about seeing whats on your chest. community is toxic. sound is absolutely terrible. unsupressed weapons are as quiet as supressed. the only advantage over Onward is being able to see your arms and body.
Multi is booooring. Big maps, only 5v5 soo this game is run and die.  Meaby after couple patches because look intresting... <Beta players who know this game like their own pocket.  Cheaters - u will see what i am talking about...> (Refunded)
Sadly had to refund, no way re key bind movement to my joysticks instead of touch pad. My sprint button just straight up wouldn't work half the time. And There seemed to be no way to turn of voice chat. I don't have a working mic currently so id rather not hear some dumbass kid yelling right into my ear every five minutes.
as of now extremely overrated. only 5 on 5 with 4 maps. feels like a stripped down onward with respawns. i may reconcider in the future but a pass for now. too much hype.
does not give a good description of the controls in the game like how to take the mag out of the gun!!!!
Made me feel sick within 1 min, refunded.
nah
In my experience... this game is NOT worth $22.00  FOUR maps that are badly designed, and too large, even if you ever manage to fill up a  5v5 server on capture the flag, which is the only gamemode to play...  Pavlov has heaping loads of more content, multiple game modes and a huge player base, It is the most popular VR shooter because of its insane low price of $10.00 .
Compared to Onward it already has a really toxic community. Maybe i just got unlucky with the servers i joined, but right now i didnt have fun playing, even when i was literally the best player on the server. In my opinion the game would also benefit from an Onward / Battlefield like medic mechanic which would increase the squad / teamplay.
This is baaaad. The multiplayer features are terrible. 5 vs 5 on a map the size a Los Vegas? What are they thinking? When you even find a populated server, you just get spawn traped by the other team, and it's impossible play tactically. The only pro is the graphics, but I get stuttering on a 1080 ti, so i don't think that's a pro. Hope I can get a refund...
Too many toxic people just like onward
Having played both pavlov and onward i was excited after reading the reviews on this game... i got in mess around with the settings, practiced the gunplay and played 3 online matches... that was all i needed to request a refund  It is an OK game... though the community is garbage, i got teabagging dudes that talked trash constantly... the gameplay was not that engaging... push the capture point and get shot from an unknown postion... the enemy can hear you running up so they can just pop around a corner and shoot you without warning.... people just spam grenades at the capture sute and the capture radius is small enough to where the grenade will hit you every time. if you are not lucky enough to be camping the objective you will be respawining and running to the objective only to be shot at a random moment from a random position.. all the matches i played was only 2 v 2 so it moved very slow.... ill stick to onward thanks.
I was really looking forward to playing this game but it won't launch. I kept getting an error saying YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY DEBUGGING SYMBOLS REQUIRED TO DISPLAY THE CALLSTACK. I tried downloading ureal engine and made sure to select INCLUDE DEBUGGING SYMBOLS, but it didn't work. Only thing I could find was a similar issue people were having with fortnite. No answers or fixes at this point so I got a refund.
save yourself the money and just get War Dust and pavlov, both do it better.
Only a single lobby open with 6 Asians in it who were team killing each other. I figured it would be more populated.  There were people obviously and blatantly using hacks, running around in super speed and seeing through walls.  I liked the loadout system and gun mods, gameplay was eh, I didn't like that it took 3 point blank shots to someones head to kill them, felt very arcade like in that regard. Holding the guns felt unnatural like I had to twist my wrist in a weird way to line up my sights.  Played for a whopping 58 minutes before requesting a refund. It has potential if they can get more than 1 lobby going, but these online VR shooters die out fast. I know they're in early access, but the hackers alone shows a lack of foresight from the developers.
I wanted to like this.  I prefer this playstyle of FPS.  It was just way too clunky. Weapon sounds were similiar to what I remember from Duke Nukem. Controls are not too terrible but I would often stop running for no reason.  Didn't care for this one.
Dec 19th***Review changed to negative until vote kick is added****  I had someone griefing and team killing me on sight yesterday, to the point where he followed me to 3 different servers just to keep griefing me.  To be honest, no vote kick or way to address griefers is a shameful oversight on the devs part. Cancerous people like this ruin games for nice people.  I STILL REALLY LIKE THE GAME, BUT REVIEW WILL STAY NEGATIVE UNTIL VOTEKICK IS ADDED. DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASE UNTIL THEN UNLESS YOURE OK PUTTING UP WITH GRIEFERS.   **********Original Positive Review ************* Ill get to the nitty gritty real fast. There is a winning recipe here, fellas. It scratches that itch for those of us wanting something more realistic/slower than Pavlov, but less so than Onward. Personally, I found Pavlovs TTK too high, where as Onwards was too low, leading to frustrating rounds of "hoof it for 5 minutes, get shot from somewhere you didn't see, repeat".   The good shtuff: Good weapon handling Good TTK, not to much, not too little Guns all SOUND amazing. (The sound of that AWP will put the fear of god into ya) Options, options, options! (Loco, snap turning, dominant hand, show body, etc.) The kinematics/animations do so much for gameplay. (Seriously, its amazing how something small as a good running and aiming animation can make the people you're playing against seem like real people, instead of avatars being controlled by people. I didn't know I was missing this from other games til I saw it here.) Good weapon variety and loadout options. There is an option to adjust the weapon model to fit your gunstock. First I've seen of this.  Let me be clear, I meant what I said about the recipe being excellent, but I do think it needs a little time in the oven. There are a lot of small QoL features that will have to be fixed if this game seriously wants to compete with Onward/Pavlov. To me, the sauce is good enough to overlook these little things until they are fixed. That being said, they are:  Teammate icons face in/out when you are looking at them- this has led me to lots of friendly fire, because I will see a teammate and shoot them before the friendly tag has a chance to appear, making him seem like an enemy. We either need persistent friendly nametags that don't go away, or more distinction between enemy/ally avatar models.  Holo Sights are slightly off to left. Not sure if I should ignore it and aim in the center to compensate, or aim with the off kilter crosshair.  Spatial audio is off - Gunshots seem fine, but footsteps need a lot of work in terms of spatial sound. Your steps only play through one ear, making you contsantly think there are people creeping on you.  Heavy armor needs a rework- The large movement penalty you get is not worth the small armor increase. You're better off picking medium most of the time, unless you want two primaries with light armor. Theres literally no benefit to using it.  Mag release is menu button (above the trackpad) - Every other game is dpad down. Dpad down = mag drop, always. Solved with button mapping.  Fire selector is dpad down- Fire selectors are on the left/right side of weapons, so Dpad left or right makes more sense to me. Again, solved by adding button mapping support.  Optimization - Jury is still out on this. I have only played a short time, and only tweaked in game settings (havent played with SS but I usually just leave it at 1.7 across the board). Even with most settings on medium, or low, I was still getting some weirdness or stuttering some places. Could just be my computer though, but I have no problems running most other stuff on medium/high just fine. (i7 4790k @4.0, GTX 1080FTW and 16g ram)  Weapon scaling - Most weapons, some more than others, run a little small. In the case of a few, laughably so, like you're holding a toy version of the original firearm. Lookin at you Steyr AUG. Bumping most of them up 10-15% in size would do the trick.   Respawn time- Personally I think it should be about half, maybe 10s tops. It's frustrating losing points waiting for respawn, and kind of hollow winning that way. I'd much rather lose uplink progress in a satisfying firefight rather than because I was just absent from the battle. Its also more satisfying to win (personally) knowing you kept them at bay versus killing them and sitting in silence while they run back from spawn.  Decoy grenade uses wideley accepted flashbang model - Small gripe, just confusing at first. Personally I'd make the decoy grenade the yellow one and the flash the one its supposed to be.  I would like a PDA or a Map or something, would be useful for seeing where your teammates are.  A little short on content- (Im satisfied with the weapon count for now, but it could use another game mode, and maps, but thats EA life. More coming down the road.    Overall, these are small issues and I imagine most of which will be addressed by the devs. Like I said, the recipe is right, it just needs to be lovingly cooked to perfection, and then I think it could be a serious contender for one of the top VR shooters.
Can only comment on my experience based on my hardware. (i5 6600k rx480 16gb RAM)  Even with most settings on low the game still seemed to stutter when moving around and firing weapons.   Game has potential for sure. will come back and try again once there has been some optimisation
Im not playing this game because you have no options to play with bots... and Team Deathmatch has no grenades...the game just needs a lot of work...and I would avoid it now.
Game seems cool, and has some cool mechanics such as the sliding and the magnifier for the holographic sight. Guns are done well, and its fun to shoot stuff, when you actually get to. I played on 3 maps because they were the only ones anyone was playing, and they were all too large. A horribly long amount of time was spent walking to the objective, onIy to get shot from somewhere I didn't even know existed, and then I would have to wait 20 seconds to respawn and walk back. From what I could tell, voice chat was global for a team and not proximity, but no one was using it so I had no way of knowing for sure. I like more sim-like vr shooters like onward, and this game is a little more simulatorey than Pavlov but not on the level of Onward. Onward uses this formula of large maps a lot better, making sniping very hard but rewarding if you can do it, making interactions between teamates fun, and conflicts go on for extended periods of time with maybe on team yelling vulgarities at eachother and all kinds of tactics being used such as using smoke to move or flanking with half of the team, instead of just run at him and shoot. TLDR; I don't think this is a good use of the arcade format for VR shooters and it ends up being fun for like 10 percent of matches. get onward if you want a tactical shooter, and pavlov for a better arcade shooter.
By far one of the worse games i have bought for vr. the scopes are the worse i have ever seen, the maps are small. There's no real aim except from shooting people. If you look at all the positive reviews they'd say they'd buy it even though they got it given to them for free for alpha testing so obviously they'd give it a good name for getting it for free however. For someone who has paid the money for the game and tried it, it's nothing like what is expected of the game. Boring and not really fun. If you want a good shooter with someone better of an aim and has alot more players try War Dust.
This ain't it chief. This game has solid game mechanics and great optimization.  However, the maps are too big for a 5v5, making it kind of boring. You run for 20-30 seconds to the OBJ, if you clear house of enemy players. You wait another 1min for enemies to attack you. If this was a 8v8 on slightly smaller maps, I think the game would be great but as it stands...it kind of feels bland. I'll keep the game as I see potential in the future.
I was expecting something similar to Onward but at the end this game feels more like a pavlov or zero caliber (arcade style) in my opinion it feels kind of goofy to shot and aim, i would recommend to change mecanics to feel more like an Onward, sorry but i'm getting a reimburse until this game is more polish, anyway it's cool that we are getting more Vr games that are not pure shit (this one is not) Buy if you like arcade shooting!
Let me put it straight: it's bad. Fps drops, freezes, totally unbalanced. I know unreal is well known for its awful optimization but why should i care? I managed to find only 1-2 servers max. They say it's better than pavlov? Well at least pavlov freaking works and has over 10 servers every time. I waited so long for this. In its current state it's like playing stalker multiplayer PVP on russian servers. Alpha players who know all the maps and played whole closed beta get 12/0 k/d and this is not joke. It's bullsнit. I Don't reccomend anyone playing this game. Better get Pavlov it's much more fun. A lot of "free copy" reviews that lick devs' buttcheeks for having free piece of unreal.school.project. If it doesn't get optimization update i'm 100% going for refund. IK rigging is objectively bad. You can see through your heavy vest's collar when look down. Only 4 maps, only one game mode. Models are from unreal shop. Pretty cheap for a game i was waiting for whole month. Shooting feels unrealistic.
Reminds me of what I thought Zero Caliber would be. The game looks really good compared to many other VR-games, level-design is OK and weapon simulation is top notch. There are no overused unity assets in sight. The game looks and feels like a proper AA-game and even in its EA-state it is quite solid. Tons of guns and accessories.  However, the gameplay itself is very cumbersome making the game feel sluggish. Imagine Call Of Duty with Arma-like mechanics and you'll have a pretty accurate image of the game. I'm not sure how they could improve the game for me without some serious redesign; they should make up their mind whether this is a realistic shooter or just a fun fast paced shooter. Now it tries and fails to be both. It's really shame as the game has so much done right that other indie games often fail with.  If you really like Call of Duty -like MP games (or Zero Caliber for some questionable reasons), this game may be for you.
While the vibrant colors and impressive visuals are very alluring, Contractors feels like more of the same.
Okay, first off I'll say this game looks awesome! However, having played most of the other available VR FPS games avaiable, this one seemed immediately lacking in intuitive controls and game play. Walking around and trying to talk to team mates was painful and not enjoyable.
I honestly felt like this game took a step backwards in the vr shooter community. I was hoping this was going to compete with Pavlov but i noticed immedietly it lost. Pavlov is better in every single aspect.
Doesn't remember pasrt level 8 so pretty useless.
Really terrible prototype of a game.  - No music or sound effects. Better than cheesy ones, I suppose, but that makes it feel really unfinished. - Only one game mechanic (click on mirror to move it 90 degrees), which results in really simple gameplay - Only one solution is accepted by game. If you point a laser to the wrong target, nothing happens. Maybe colored lasers/targets would help? - Entire game crashed on my computer after completing ~20 levels maybe?  This really should be a free game and even then I wouldn't really recommend it. It really plays like a javascript game from some random GitHub repo.
