    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. \n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/reviews_ex.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg)."

Keep doing what your doing developer!!! Hoping for more content!\\n\", 'craze game, wish there was more content.\\n', \"The Secrets of Dr. Wu DLC is the first attempt at a proper DLC for JWE and it is a mixed bag in my opinion. Yes, the new hybrids are okay, but I prefer real dinosaurs over ugly hybrids. That being said, there are two new real dinosaurs offered in this expansion, Olorotitan and Troodon. This may not be enough for some, but it's a start.  The real strength of this DLC lies in the new genetic modification options it presents. New comfort genes have been added to allow you to change how many other dinosaurs of the same species or other species your dinosaurs can tolerate, change the amount of habitat elements required by different dinosaur species, and even allows you to make normally solitary dinosaurs like T. rex and Allosaurus rather socially tolerant of other members of their kind. Also, for those who want a movie accurate Indominus rex, you can now breed them with the camouflage gene like the one in the film.  The expansion also offers new research items like an improved storm defense station. There are also automatically applied tools to help increase ticket revenue, reduce legal fees from dino attacks, insure you against failed dinosaur incubations, and even increase the speed of your transport teams to transport dinosaurs to different locations or haul away dead ones faster.  I must say that the improvements and features brought in with this DLC are a mixed bag, but I think it leans more towards the positive in the end. If you like the base game, get this as soon as you can then. It overall has a much better and more well-told story this time compared to the base game, so that's also a plus. I recommend it certainly. Some may disagree and say this content should have been in at launch, but I point out that they can't just make everything free. They've got to make revenue to continue to improve the game somehow.\\n\", 'Just played your game Bright Memory - Episode 1 and what can I say, you have done a super awesome work, this game is super cool, it got everything action, story and a beautiful atmosphere, just love it :)\\n', 'love the game i hope there is more stuff comes to the game new guns more levels  its a good game but it needs more stuff\\n', 'Wtf did i just play hahahahaha\\n', \"So this review is going to be a little long winded so go to the end for the TLDR.... I've played Ark for a while on Xbox One and can finally enjoy it on pc, though there are some issues I have, some are shared between the two, and one particular one I've noticed on pc. For the people wondering what Ark:Survival Evolved is, I would describe it as Turok with a survival mode and base building, it's a game I've enjoyed for a long time even with the performance issues and little quirks. (I don't plan on getting into the whole early access game with DLC thing as that boat has already sailed.)  So lets cover issues I've had with the game, you may not get these, or they may be worse for you.  Xbox One s- Gradual frame loss- the game runs great for an hour or two, but eventualy the fps starts to stutter and will have slideshow moments seemingly out of the blue. Plydough Extinction- (have not checked recently) Extinction's....well, everything looks like Playdough after about five minutes. Crashing to home screen- Sometimes, the game gives up, making a loud buzzing noise before closing out and returning to the Xbox home screen. System shutdown- If a crash is extreme, the console will outright turn itself off or restart itself.  PC (upgraded OptiPlex 7010) Primitive + CTD's- This seems to be a widespread issue for a lot of people, I attempted to load it and waited 20+ minutes loading just to have it crash. Crashing on world exit- only seems to happen when disconnecting from a server, I don't have this problem when closing out a single player world. Low more demanding- (probably system specific) If I use the lowest graphics settings, my performance is not that great, I now use mixed high and I have more stable fps and performance.  There are other smaller things that though are bugs, most aren't game breaking though some can be irksome.  TLDR This game is great but is not well optimized, I still recommend it, but be aware of it's issues.\\n\", \"It's Timberman. The VS might as well be a V2. Not that it is that bad though. It plays just like the old one except the ui looks nicer and there are a couple more modes.  However, I have major gripes with this game as it is currently.  In the old game one could press a single button to go back to chopping after failing. In this one you have to wait for a crossed axe fade to black animation, press enter, wait for the exp bar to display its change, and then only can you start again. Also, after every single run(and mine are short because I suck so this happens often) the three total chopping milestone achievements update their values and display as a Steam notification. It is annoying and unecessary.  On the main character select screen for singleplayer, after I select my character and confirm with Q, the enter key does not work to start the game.\\n\", 'good game very much yes!\\n', \"It's got a lot of potential. My biggest gripe is the ollie and flip trick mechaincs, pulling back on one or both sticks and releasing means I have to jump if I let go of the stick, and pulling back on both sticks to ollie higher feels unatural. I find myslef doing tricks I didn't intend to do a lot, and I still haven't been able to get a blunt slide to work. Grabs don't work yet either? I get that it's early access but I feel like a lot of the core tricks and mechanics would be working already. I much prefer the way Session does it where pulling back on either stick primes the ollie and pushing up on the opposite stick pops the trick.   If you love skating and want something challenging and realistic you should still pick this up. I look forward to seeing how this game develops.\\n\", \"So one problem that people complain about is the bugs in this game.  I'm assuming that it depends on when the reviews were written, because for me, the biggest problem ive seen is free dinosaurs walking into walls (occasionally) or a megoladons tail sticking out of the water.  Other than that, the gameplay is great, and its thrilling to try and tame huge dinosaurs, and a huge relief when you do, and its so fun to use them.  Idk, i just feel like this game deserves more credit and attention.\\n\", 'Great survival game. Give it a try if you enjoy these style of games.\\n', \"Lost in Vivo is probably my favorite indie horror game as of writing this review, it's a fantastic ride from beginning to end, with tons of creative scares and a true sense of claustrophobia. I am very pleased to say this game DOESN'T have autosave, as I believe manually saving at specifc points in the game help create true terror. I am also enthralled to say this is not a walking simulator, there is combat, but it never feels like it's going into the direction of an action game and feels pretty restrained, thankfully. The Silent Hill inspiration is obvious, especially if you've played any of the older entries in the series, but it's just different enough to stand on it's own. I will admit though, there were some small bits here and there I wasn't terribly fond of, like how the very first enemy type you encounter is pretty obnoxious to deal with, especially compared to later ones. Another issue I had was the length, it's so incredibly short, and for the most part the game takes place entirely in a single location until the very end, where you get a single unique area that feels different from the rest. I also think it didn't HAVE to be in first person, but doing so does help it stand out from the Silent Hill series, along with it's fun art style. Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10, 2018 was a good year for indie horror, as the demo for Visage was also released. I hope future indie horror devs can learn from games like this and make something truly special themselves.\\n\", 'Holy Crap guys, I love this so much.

It stars a young operative, Sheila, who is trying to stop a group known as SAI from reaching the \"Land of Sky\" to mine the secrets of it\\'s inhabitants and their rebirth.  PRO - The story is pretty great from what I understand of it so far. There isn\\'t too much delivered so far but it seems like it will be a good story. - Bright Memory looks really nice and runs pretty well. - The Chinese audio gives a better sense of immersion. - There\\'s a few skills and abilities to play around with which are fun to use. - Achievements are challenging if not a little easy at times. - The boss and standard enemy designs are nice. - The music fits the game really well. - It\\'s not too difficult but you need to utilise your skill set to overcome the enemy.  NEUTRAL - Since this is a Chinese game there are a fair number of spelling and grammatical mistakes but nothing that comes close to making you feel lost in translation.  CON - Right now it\\'s a pretty short game that can be completed in around 30 to 45 minutes. - To be expected from an Early Access title there are quite a few bugs and glitches but these should hopefully be fixed in no time as the game expands. - The checkpoint system is a little messed up. I fought a boss, defeated him and went off to the next area but fell down a ravine. I then spawned to the moment where I was about to fight the boss and yes, I had to beat him again to continue.  For £3.63 (EA sale price) it\\'s worth a play through or even if you just have half an hour spare to give it a go.

Really I did, I loved the previous two Tasty Planet games, Tasty Blue as well. But wow, did this game disapoint. Especially when I found out what the ending was.  Don\\'t get me wrong, the controls and the graphics are just like the other games and they look as fine as ever, but what drove me nuts were both the cutscenes and the stages themselves.  The cutscenes, there\\'s bulidup, but never pay off. It started with the two scientists, which were huge staples in both the first two games [spoiler] Including the final chapter of Tasty Blue\\t[/spoiler] ...and they were running a resteraunt in Paris for some reason. Not that [spoiler] Not only is this their only appearance in the whole game, you can\\'t even interact with them or even see them in gameplay\\t[/spoiler] . And the others, well, their either completely ridiculous or just outright stupid, [spoiler] How would anyone breed a dingo to eat literally anything? How did the octopus or even the fox learn how to eat everything without even an explanation? How did the grey goo that, in the first two games, was created in a lab end up on Mars? And the worst part is that none of them even have a conclusion, not one final cutscene, even in the last stage\\t[/spoiler]. Not to mention, there are several stages you\\'re supposed to avoid certain objects or lose points, like removing cynaide from some water molecules or infesting animals, but who cares? most of them seem to be to help people, but you\\'re gonna be eating them in the next stage anyways, so why even help them? But anyways, about the Grey Goo section, the one that broke the camels back for me, which, unfortunatley is one huge spoiler, so for those who haven\\'t played yet and still don\\'t wanna be spoiled, it\\'s nothing like the previous games finales  [spoiler] It started off promising enough, with the Goo at it\\'s first stage, eating quarks and moving up as usual, before getting to the point where he could eat both Mars and the Earth (even if in the Bumblebee stage, you could eat Earth anyways, which leads to the conclusion none of these are in the same story but I digress) and it all goes good, going with the routes of eating the Milky Way, galaxies and even, for a nice touch, the Flying Spaghetti Monster and it all leads up to...the exact same thing from the start. No joke, it\\'s just the stage where you could only eat Quarks again. Same background, same objects with the same apperance, they even move in the exact same way. The only difference is know they were being called \"Universes\" instead of \"Quarks\", because that makes so much difference. Going from tearing the fabric of the universe apart and eating the turtles of time...to just eating them up like they were M&Ms which you just did in the start. And not even an ending comic to wrap it up, just credits. What a joke!\\t[/spoiler]   At the end of it all, if you wanna play a Tasty Planet game, go for any of the other three. If anything, both Tasty Planet 2 and Tasty Blue did just about everything better. Tasty Planet 2 giving you actual different enviroments that all feel distinctly different before [spoiler] That goofy, yet kinda epic ending with the Turtles of Time\\t[/spoiler] and Tasty Blue where there was an overarching story with the multiple playable characters and [spoiler] Ending not only taking out the other forms but even being able to chomp through the Earth, something none of the others even got close too\\t[/spoiler]  This game had nothing new or better to offer that the previous games did, plain and simple.\\n', \"Fun and simple game. It's a fairly 'zen' kind of game, like Kingdom New Lands, but there are times when things get hairy. There's no tutorial, which I'm ok with and also like Kingdom, but it does mean you have to guess what you can do and experiment to come up with strategies that work, which is kind of fun. Well worth the price - buy it!\\n\", \"It is just a very small demo area. For fans of the Skate series once the gameplay clicks it's clear this is the skate replacement we have been waiting years for. This is very rough around the edges but already it shows so much potential.  For the hardcore fans of the Skate series it's worth the price. Others may want to wait for more content.    Highly recommend.\\n\", 'Amazing!\\n', \"I didn't see anything on the steam page about updates in upcoming patches like the developer talked about in others reviews.  I guess he assumes everyone is going to read everything about his game from the forums and understand its a work in progress.  A ridiculous thought and shows a disconnect from the gaming community as a whole.  Also the developer seems to be a little on the unprofessional side with his comments to reviewers.  He seems insecure and can't help himself from reviewing the reviewer.  Just another reason not to buy a game produced by this guy.  As far as the game itself goes it is rough and needs lots of improvement.  I'm not going to go into them cause other reviews already have.    Most annoying part of the game right now is the sound of the engines.\\n\", \"So! I purchased this DLC the day it came out, been playing it ever since. My thoughts on it? Well, I've become quite fond of the Dominus in the time I've played, and I rarely used any other ever since I started using it. The McLaren feels somewhat like the Dominus (shares the same hitbox), though from my experience, it does seem to give the ball a little extra power when you hit it with your wheels, which is a fun ability to use as it catches a lot of people off-guard. I'd say that if you can get over the fact that it can be barely customized (similar to the original Batmobile), you get a well rounded Dominus-esque vehicle that looks fancy and plays rather nicely.\\n\", \"Devs are lazy and don't fix the game. INSTEAD THE BAN PEOPLE GLOBALLY. FUCK THIS GAME.\\n\", 'This game was cool and fun at first, but a lot of things ruined it. I had to set down the graphics because of the lag, even so, there is still some lag in the game. The game has crashed many times even with toned down graphics. There are also many glitches in the game. Also, the game play is too complicated. I wanted to play this in single player, but the survival exploration aspect makes this game too tedious and too time consuming. Too much inventory management, too much crafting, too much surviving. So much time can be spent taming a animal just for it to get lost or killed. More powerful animals can come out of no where and kill me without any chance for me to escape.  I hate it how i can easily run out of resources which means that i need to restart the whole game. I also hate that there are unfair ways to die, like for instance this one time i died because i accidentally ate some poisonous thing. Too many bad decisions like upgrading the wrong skills, using resources unwisely, going to a dangerous territory unprepared, forgetting to carry certain things, losing things, getting lost, and losing rare items. Without respawn, the game would be totally unfair, but in a survival game there shouldnt even be any respawning, yet the survival conditions in this game are too realistic even though respawning contradicts all that. I dont like it how the game actually expects me to play on multiplayer, but what about first learning how to play the game first in single player? Too many annoying people in multiplayer. The game is just too difficult, time consuming, and buggy.\\n', '牛逼 \\n', \"I feel this game has potential, and it is pretty fun to play so I'll do a bit of a detailed review. Scroll all the way to the bottom to read the detailed part.  Negative first: - Game resolution cannot be changed in-game; however, you can edit your registry to change the resolution manually: Computer\\\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\DefaultCompany\\\\Ninja Code. - While the game is minimalistic, this does not mean there should not be at least a checkbox to disable the background music. - There is a key bug where you can spam click tiles to skip turns, effectively breaking the game. - I decompiled the game and found it is using playmaker in production, along with default project settings. The developers didn't even bother to brand or copyright their game. - The icons on the main menu are quite confusing as to what they mean, though you can sort of guess. Cross to exit, file to load game, but why an envelope for a new game?  Positive icing on the cake: - I love how the game mechanics and turn by turn based actions work, and it fits well for the style. - There are some pretty cool pieces such as the bamboo and some pretty cool other things I will not spoil the game. - The lack of a tutorial is rather interesting and it didn't take long for me to get the hang of new things. The game just throws you 'into the fray', so to speak. - I won't say I love the background music, but I think it ties well into the simplistic nature of the game and sets the theme well. - The game has a defined theme set around ninjas and stealth and that's really cool.  Detailed:  I feel the game is enjoyable to play and challenging to figure it out, if you're not a hardcore puzzle solver like myself. Most of the levels are easy to play, but it feels like that's the way they are designed. There is no tutorial, as I mentioned and that's cool for this game in particular so it leaves you to figure things out.   I feel a bit frustrated when you have to click on exactly the tile you are wanting to navigate to and you can only move one tile at a time. This can get annoying when you've killed all the enemies on the level and you're going for the exit. The lack of an options menu or any basic UI to change core game settings is a bit annoying, but not a real hinderance. There is also this toon effect that blurs the edges of objects, and I feel that's a bit unnecessary.   Overall, I sort of enjoyed this game, but I don't feel it's worth the AUD$7 price tag, even considering the developers don't have a Unity licence, but can pay for playmaker and use it in production.   If the developers upgrade to a newer version of Unity, stop using playmaker, get rid of that ridiculous toon shader and at least add a basic set of options on the main menu, then I would rate this game positive.  Best of wishes to the developer and may you read this review and hopefully amend your game because it could be super awesome with a bit of polish.\\n\", 'I thought I escaped this hell, but new DLC dragged me back...\\n', '+ simple gameplay physics variability minimalism  - music few opportunities\\n', 'güzel\\n', \"I had to buy this almost as soon as it was available, because as far as I'm concerned, Reiche and Ford make the best games AND the best DLC.\\n\", \"Sister Travel is a fun adult centric game similar to most Rance titles, with some sprinkled serious threats causing drama, and a protagonist who is quite forceful to the heroines but generally has a heart of gold for them, but is generally superior feeling wise to Rance by at least taking care of his harem without any direct physical or mental abuse. Gameplays pretty much the general early Final Fantasy type, not really much to improve on it, if you don't like turn based you won't like it, if you do main thing that might be unique if not innovative is that consumables can be used for actions besides potions, such as limited bow attack commands by buying arrows, with the benefit being bows have higher base attack. h scenes are uncensored, and while not gratuitously detailed like some real obscure vns are still pretty hawt with good enough details to make the mind wander. Heroines are likeable, with the ones you should aquire quickly being a older sister merchant type, a energetic best friend type, and little sister that seems to get wet from dismembering bears(?). I was expecting ntr judging by their previous releases but was surprised by getting a game that combines some of the best of Imouto Paradise and Monster Girl Quest. I regret nothing and highly recommend it, and pray for Kagura Games to publish more indie japanese rpgs with less ntr centric plots and less men or women that are colorless village bicycles.\\n\", 'pretty lame game. pales in comparison to skate 2\\n', \"As the game stands I would not recommend the game. It's been out since December and the developers haven't done any major changes to the game, just minor bug fixes. I can see this game being worth $20 when its more polished. If you're really really itching for a skateboarding game with 1 small stage, this game is for you. Yes, there are modders that make levels, but that should also be on the developers to do so and not sit back and let others design their game.\\n\", \"This DLC is super fun  I'm a super late fan to the game but i can say through all the time pieces that have been in this the Nyakuza metro has been the most fun i have had and it still haven't even gotten the rift pieces yet. I also find it super cool how the new flair and dyes are found through the members of the gang which serves the need for exploration (and a large sum of pons) to acquiring them, but the story telling for this level is amazing with the added benefit of the metro passes that make the world feel bigger and full of extra secrets.  the only poo on my cornflakes when it comes to this is that my mods don't seem to want to download again, or just got removed by the game for now, but other than that i love this update and i hope i can find all the stickers and dyes and flair.  thanks gears for breakfast ya'll really knocked this out of the park (bat jokes)\\n\", 'this game is impossible to pass.

I liked how it did feel sort of like a Silent Hill game with how the graphics where slightly janky and pixelated like an original playstation title. Not just that but the art style, sound effects and music were very reminiscent of the first Silent Hill.  It was kind of sort, and kind of confusing, story wise however. I have only played through it once so I might lack clearity, but my playthrough felt like the story was sort of rambling in a way. Going from one scary thing to another scary thing with no explination as to how the things are actually connected. At least not apparently. Perhaps it becomes more clear with multiple play throughs, but I would have liked to have have the \"ah-ha!\" moment at the end when everything clicks and you have the \"I see what you did there.\" moment.

After coming through the birth of gaming at the young age of 55 this game is what is missing today.  It is literally pick up and play instructions are not needed.

Not once in the few years I\\'ve been playing have I thought of it as a waste of money. I\\'ve played  on PVE for the most part, could never get into the pvp due to alpha tribes. It definitely has some flaws, and by flaws I mean:  -poor meshing  -unstable servers -\"box tribes\" that refuse to follow ToS (mostly any other letter character that is not in your language or internationally used shows up as a [], mostly Chinese) -\"pilllaring\" and unnecessary land claims -Random deaths while offline and protected (usually after patches/server crashes. always log off with your body empty) -Lots of bullshit moments such as random dc while flying/fighting, or a giga decides to say hi to your new home.  -Troodons, fuck those little bastards -if raising babies, sometimes they don\\'t register that they have an entire trough of food next to them and starve  There is definitely a lot of flaws, but there are good things too:  -definitely addicting. getting that first base built or taming your first animal feels big. eventually you\\'ll feel the need to tame every damn dodo you see ;) -Interacting with others. Almost everyone has the same goals in mind. Helping or being helped goes a long way in getting trust and making friends. Don\\'t be the loner who never talks, talking to people, offering to help, getting to know everyone on server and being active makes your chances of being accepted into a tribe or just by the server itself really easy. (New people ppleaseeee don\\'t get angry if nobody will let you join their tribe with your fresh new character. Inside jobs are common. make a home and prove you can be somewhat self sufficient first. someone will most likely take notice and invite you :) ) -The maps are awesome. whichever map you chose definitely gives a challenge. Personal favorite is Ragnarok, but it can get laggy. -Commitment. This game is not for someone looking for a few minutes to waste time before work. Before you know it, you\\'ll have grown a beard and wondered where your life has went. playing for 3 minutes could turn into 3 hours easily. IF youre looking for a long term game and have a lot of time to play, this is the game for you. -Server transfers. if you join a server and everyone is being an absolute dick to you, or there is no space to build, then you can transfer your character and dinos to another server that is the same game mode (PVE=PVE)(PVP=PVP)(PVE ≠ PVP). keep to official tho, you cannot transfer to unofficial or to legacy, vice versa. you will have to start over if you switch to a different server layout. -Tribes. To have the best time of your life, get yourself a tribe of weirdos. The more misfits, the merrier. Want to troll a fellow comrade? Tranq arrow his ass, throw his body into a pin-coded cage, and either whip or torture him to your hearts content. Have an offline buddy who owns a big base? drag him and let him log into random areas to confuse him when he gets on. Better yet, if you\\'re allied with your neighbors, why not just drag and drop him there? He\\'ll log on and wonder how the hell he ended up in your ally\\'s pig pen. And yes, they do shit a lot.  For the most part, its a wonderful community. I have had a few problems here and there with other tribes, but the overall game has been awesome. Id recommend to anyone who just wants to mess around and have a little fun with friends while watching your tribe mate get mauled by a raptor or two. \\n', 'This review contains spoilers for Nyakuza Metro. Continue at your own risk.  This DLC could have been perfect. The Metro was built well and was a great area to explore. I did enjoy the platforming this chapter provided. Online party was, well, they tried. I can see how some people like it.  It was the chapter\\'s ending that ruined the experience to me. There was so much buildup with the Empress in the elevator at the end of Rush Hour and it could have been perfectly capped off with a boss fight. Seriously, watch a clip of the cutscene at the end of Rush Hour and you\\'ll see how much of a letdown it is. Instead you just get cops getting onto the elevator and the Empress running away. The \"secret mini-boss\" was also a joke. One move for the whole fight. Nothing interesting.  In online party it isn\\'t really online co-op, it\\'s just A Hat in Time with some other Hat Kids that do nothing. When they say not everything is synced, they really mean nothing important is synced. It would have been great to have actual co-op over the internet, but what we got was frankly a disappointment. Having 50 players online at once was prioritized over having a fun and complete experience. Online party is good for a half hour of fun, but after that it gets pointless.  This DLC made me sad because I loved the base game so much. Seal the Deal, well certainly not perfect (I\\'m looking at you, three new acts called a chapter and insane difficulty in death wish) didn\\'t make the major mistakes this DLC did. The letdown of the ending to the Metro and online party really not being what it could have been just ruined the experience for me.

There is a ton to see, explore, build, and content to defeat for many hours of gameplay.  I recommend buying it during random sales as I did as it is definitely worth $20.  I like builder survival games like minecraft with a bit more flavor.  Minecraft does not tickle my pickle as I find the graphics not to my liking (I understand that it is a choice on their part, but is one I do not enjoy), and I find that the content is also lacking.  I have very much enjoyed Conan Exiles, and Ark which are similar in that they are survival games where building is integral to progression.  I like the graphics of Conan Exiles better, but pretty much everything else I prefer Ark.  The mechanics in Ark are very challenging, but not insurmountable.  The mount system is deep, engaging, and there was obviously a lot of work & thought put into each dinosaur's unique attributes / skills.  The map is large enough to allow for space between players, but not so big as to be cumbersome (like Eve or Red Dead).  PvE rewards good tactics / teamwork, buuuuuuut PVP can be a little janky with hit registry being hard to manage at times.  My biggest critique is that the game is only moderately stable.  Every third play session I crash out (which in this style of game can REALLY hurt), and every time I log in it takes multiple attempts (time outs, crashes, or the game not even registering the server is available even when it is).  Overall a solid buy especially if it is on sale.\\n\", \"warcraft 2 + warcraft 3. They said multiplayer is coming.

Unfortunately it's made with a very confusing User Interface and without any way to actually understand what you need to do to progress in the game, even if the developers say it's very easy to understand, it's not.  Graphic could be better even for a low-budget indie production, as its sound effects. Can't really understand anything also because it's poorly translated in english. The most important thing the game tells you is not to use a pirate copy of it, which should not worry developers at all since the game is actually unplayable.

You just got to play it for some time for things to take off. Gallery and simple but nice graphics let you do this without any problems.   I really liked the game as a whole, the only thing is that during the first 15 minutes I was a bit confused about all that movements, locations, etc., but I suppose this is the way it has to be in an action metroidvania.   But after I got used to all the acrobatic tricks (luckily controls are great) and map, the game started to shine, loads of tricks allow you to do really cool things  + enemies also have abilities which turns battles into crazy fun  + interaction with the environment, for example, you can drop a hanging cube onto the enemy and tear it into pieces.  + different weapons allow you to choose a different play style.   Same with the plot – at start nothing is clear but in the end I felt a bit sad even though I am not that much sentimental.   Little tips for autists like me:  Red rooms on the map are rooms with bosses. The nearest boss (ninja) makes ball of speed boost (violet one) available  Crystal boss – trampoline  Desert boss – flight (black ball)   -!!Take HP as a first upgrade!!. Upgrades don't cost much.   -!!Choose Acolyte difficulty!!, that equals normal difficulty, I guess.   +you can farm points by killing monsters, so if you need some you can find room with lots of enemies (like a desert corridor level), kill them, then leave this room and enter again/ repeat.   All in all, 7-8 out of 10. I’d give one more point if there were more tips.  (considering cost of $2 it is 11/10)   In fact, game is not that hard, you just need to get used to it.  Recommended!

The only mechanics that I feel could be tweaked is the gunplay, and the only other complaint being the relatively poor optimisation. Official servers are a grind-fest however, I'd recommend an unofficial or non-dedicated server if you'd like to play with friends - PVE and PVP have plenty of unique fun to offer, even if you generally prefer one mode to the other.

Good job devs and please keep up the good work. Thanks.\\n', 'I would give this a loose Recommendation and I mostly focused on the campaign, but overall it\\'s still ok.   The main gripe I have with this game is that it feels extremely ridged mechanically. Your gold income is extremely fixed and enemy waves are also fairly predictable. As such, it feels like you are forced to turtle at the start of every game, only able to move out after they attack first. Also, trying to scout around is generally prohibited, as there\\'s usually something that can easily overwhelm a scout or a small group. Moreover, since your gold income is fixed, any loses to your scouting group removes potential defenders once the enemy waves come in, forcing you to spend more gold re-enforcing everything.                  To put it another way, it feels like there\\'s a theoretical timer/\"rubber-band-effect\" between when you can move out & attack the enemy and when you have to defend. So, if you lose any units, that timer is extended, making a lot of this a waiting game unit you have a critical mass of units.    A possible but difficult feature to implement solution would be to remove the Warcraft 3 5-villager limit on the gold and change it to W2\\'s unlimited number of clipping villagers collecting gold. This would change quite a bit, however with the W3\\'s upkeep system in place, you still have to balance worker-to-military ratio, making a larger workforce viable but not overpowered.     I also would like to see higher amounts of gold in the mines, allowing for more leniency if your main attack force fails. While I\\'ve only gotten close to this scenario, I can easily see someone lose their army on a massive push and immediately afterwards, their gold mine runs out. They would have to restart the level, waiting through that theoretical timer again, which is frustrating.

I thought wow, 96% overwhelmingly positive must be a no-brainer! Well, now I know steam reviews isn't metacritic. There are plenty of good reviews so I'll provide a negative review   It's way too short.   The game feels too generic. Yes the combat, mobility, action has been done well but there are other games that have done this. I wouldn't mind playing more of that except that with the incredible generic and clique settings and dialogues it gets really monotone.  In fact, even the gameplay was fun for the first 10 minutes then it falls off fast. The boss was just a mob with large HP and the strategy of defeating him gets reduced down to boredom.   Throughout the game there are no real dangers or challenges because you can just keep up your HP with each enemies killed and you have abilities that doesn't cost anything, have short unique cds that can be spammed. When there are no challenges or risks of failure, the gameplay degenerates into an experience akin to playing in a sandbox. Fun for kids, fun for a while, but gets old real fast for those who have played a lot of games.

Each chapter you need to find clues and other items to proceed through the room(s) until you find the last room with the Ancient Scroll.  This unlocks the next chapter, etc.   The puzzles are mostly logical (easy to hard in no particular order) and progresses you through the levels at a nice pace.  At the end of each chapter, you receive a score for the amount of time it took you, number of items you found and level of difficulty you played.  It then shows your ranking amongst all the players who have played.  I admit, I played Easy this time through, though I plan to go back and play the other levels to try to complete all the achievements.   An interesting aspect to note:  There are no saves mid-chapter (though on Easy, the levels can be played usually between 30 and 45 minutes each).  You can pause the game if you have to stop for a while.  Otherwise, if you exit out and return to play the same chapter, most of the items and clues will have spawned to a different place.

First of all I think the game play is nice, it is kinda mix of Tomb Raider and Doom. Controls are good and if you have ever played an ego-shooter before everything should be familiar. The setting is interessting, something like \"time-space-travel\"? I like it. However Graphics are not state-of-the-art but also not bad. For a Demo it is really okay. And that\\'s the point... The current state of the game (early access) is just a 25 Minute Gameplay Demo. I read something like \"it is a one man project\". Well so I guess it took a while to put all of this together, and for this it is great... what I fear is that this is another \"never ending development story\" which will need several years to finish, if it does... I\\'m looking forward to more content.  If you interessted in 25 Minutes of decent shooter gameplay, and your are willing to spend 5,5€ go ahead. If not, watch the gameplay as video and wait for a later release.  So for now... I\\'m missing the option in Steam: \"Do you recommend this game?: Maybe\", since this is not possible, and I\\'m not that impressed... I wouldn\\'t recommend the game at this stage. However this might change in the future!  Ah and one thing to the developer.

The only downside I see is that the game progresses too slowly, especially at the very last stages it becomes a problem and all you can do is wait, especially if you already have a big base.

These easily-manageable groups let you connect with your friends easily and other people just randomly playing. This can help you greatly on you first few hours, trying to still understand how to play. Ark's flawless in-game chat helps you talk with your tribe and other people.

[/h1]  [b] Pros: [/b]  + Gorgeous FPS game that has been created by a single developer + Astonishing graphics + Visually stunning combat effects + Fast paced gameplay + The game is perfectly optimized despite the fact that it's still in Early Access   [b] Cons: [/b]  - No English voice acting - Way too short: can be completed in 30 minutes - Not much of a story in this first episode - Minor bugs here and there  Actually, I always promise to myself never ever touch any Early Access game. And I really mean it - almost every EA project that I dealt with, was a complete disaster and it always ended with a refund. Reasons were different: from poor optimization to shallow gameplay full of weird mechanics. Not to mention, that most of the Early Access projects associated with survival sandbox games, which have never been my cup of tea.  And then I saw Bright Memory. Another Early Access title, another...wait a second! Oh wow, so it’s a first person shooter that has been developed by a single person? And it has Overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam? That looks and sounds impressive I felt like I really needed to see this. I decided to give this game a chance and it was a good decision!     [h1] Story [/h1]  Bright Memory doesn't reveal too much of a story for us in the first episode and we can only see some small episodes of the plot, trying to piece it in one single picture. The game is set in the near future, in 2020. We see a mysterious secret organization named Science Research Organization (SRO) that found material in an ancient sword that is able to revive dead creatures. Another third-party military organization infiltrated into their research institute trying to take the material away. They managed to change the coordinates of the transmitter and set it somewhere to the Arctic, where they found a place with a bunch of ancient creatures. These actions led to transporting there a girl named Shelia, who has to investigate these events and do whatever it takes to stop SAI.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  The whole gameplay in Bright Memory is represented as a face paced shooter full of action and mindblowing scenes stuffed with visual effects. Straight from the first seconds, the game throws you into the action and never let you rest till the end of this frustratingly short episode.   Shelia has an arsenal of a few weapons which help her to effectively rush through the hordes of enemies. This arsenal includes an automatic gun, handgun and of course, an overpowered sword with all these fancy abilities. The game gives you a short brief about how all these weapons work in the game and that briefing doesn’t last long, I would say that length is fair enough for players to understand the basic mechanics and never feel like they are bored of these neverending tutorials.  Shooting from the guns feels pretty smooth and works pretty impressive as for the work of one person. The only problem is that the whole screen is full of redundant tiny UI elements that can distract you from the game from time to time. However, I guess it can be something personal, simply because I work as a web designer myself and I noticed that usually, most of the things that I find annoying or bad in terms of design are not a big deal for other players.   The whole fun begins when you equip the ancient sword, which has superpower abilities and can easily slash hordes of enemies. These abilities have been designed to be effective against the big pack of enemies and tough monsters. Keep in mind that sometimes enemies can disappear and then appear once again, especially when you fight them with a sword, because the game is still under development, so it has minor bugs and glitches here and there. But in general, it doesn’t happen way too constantly and doesn’t affect your gameplay badly.   Despite the fact that the game with its single available episode is pretty short, the player will meet a few bosses during this run. They are not hard to beat and they definitely don’t bring anything new or exciting in FPS genre, but these fights definitely look spectacular. One of the bosses look like an homage to Dark Souls series and this is not the only one reference for this game in Bright Memory.   Shelia gains the EXP point every time she kills someone and when she has enough of them, she is able to buy a new upgrade for herself. These upgrades usually mean more powerful weapons, longer jumps or increased stamina.   In general, this episode shows a great potential of the future game that has a big chance to become a top-selling hit, that everybody will enjoy if the developer won’t fail it. As for now, it looks like a short technical demo and I probably spent more time writing this review than actually playing it.                [h1] Graphics [/h1]  Graphics look absolutely amazing, for one person development this is absolutely mindblowing and looks like a decent AAA game. The only problem worth mentioning is Shelia’s face animation and small graphical glitches during some cutscenes. Other than that, everything looks beautiful, including visual effects, monster’s design and environment. The game is very well optimized for the Early Access title, so I can say, that Bright Future is probably one of the best experiences I have ever had with a game, that is still in development.   [h1] Sound [/h1]  The whole episode is filled with thrilling j-rock music during the intense shootings and battles. These tunes definitely add more of the action feel to the game and boost your experience to the highest level. Some of the background sounds may be glitched as well here and there, but again, this game is still on its early stage of development.   The biggest problem regarding Bright memory is that it doesn’t have English dub, only English text. I really hope that this will be fixed in the future.   [h1] Conclusion [/h1]   Bright Memory is a very ambitious project and you can’t deny the fact that for a single person this game looks pretty impressive. I recommend this game to everyone who is in love with fast-paced shooter games and willing to see what a single person is capable to do with due dedication.

It is more simplistic than Punch Club, but if you are a fan of these tycoon fight management games, this is still a solid game. There is a still a lot of grinding in terms of getting your fighters to a better level, but this also exists in the Punch Club game. I thought the mechanics were decent, and there is still an innate strategical element to the game. I enjoyed this part of it. However, my issue stems with the game constantly crashing. I have an updated PC with a newer graphics card that I installed myself recently, and have played many other more resource intensive games with no issues. I would win a fight, and the game would crash. I would restart, and I would lose some of the items I had purchased in my gym for no reason.   I gave the game many chances. I changed to the windowed version, I changed the screen resolution, I changed the graphics quality, and I restarted my PC again. All to no avail. I have to give this game a negative simply due to the fact that it appears to be unplayable. I see other users take issue with the innate gameplay mechanics, and I suppose this is subjective. I don't tend to judge that many games harshly, but not being able to play the game after paying for it infuriates me. It constanly crashes on my Windows 10 PC with no error mesasges that I could potentially resolve. I asked Steam for a refund, but their policy states that they don't refund after two hours of gamplay. I gave the game more than this time because I wanted to play it. I really did. I restarted many times in the hopes that these issues would be resolved. So, it is probable that I will not get a refund and will be stuck with an unplayable game. Thus, I have to give it a negative and I won't purchase any other games from this developer in the future.\\n\", 'I liked the game. I\\'m glad I bought it. However, I have to qualify my recommendation a bit.   The thing is, I\\'m nuts. When I was younger, and less bitter/broken/bleak/cynical/realistic/ pessimistic/nihilistic, I held the irrationally romantic notion of how wonderful it would be to love a ghost. To be free from the petty foibles that plague human-to-human relationships; to have love sublimated to its highest, purest form.  So, when I saw this on Steam, I was essentially forced to buy it for the premise alone. And I thank the creators for going with a somewhat odd, possibly hard-to-sell premise such as this. It reminded me of my more innocent and hopeful youth, of which few things are now capable.  That said, I would wager that most people aren\\'t equally besotted with the concept; and in that case, take my recommendation as you will.   As an impartial critic, I will say that some might object to the Christian bias of the game\\'s treatment of the afterlife. I have no strong inclinations for or against any particular religion (aside from pagan blood-feuds, hoorah!), so it didn\\'t bother me remotely.  Also, as a critic, I\\'ll say I wish the game had a few more choices, so as to make the ones that are there feel more crucial; it doesn\\'t seem like you can vary widely between playthroughs. But to be fair, I\\'ve only played through it once so far.  Also with critical neutrality (I say this to emphasize that I\\'ve taken off my \"I love ghost sex!\" hat), I believe the writer handled the characters well. It would take a particular kind of personality to be open to loving a ghost.\\n', \"Well, this game is certainly something, very short in terms of a regular playthrough but It's really cool nonetheless, uses the Cuphead boss rush format but it's a bullet hell typing game.   controls almost identical to your standard bullet hell game using arrow keys to weave in and out of enemy attacks while having to type exorcisms with your left hand which is certainly unique and I think it pulls it off really well. You'd be surprised by how many typos you make under the pressure, It's one of the few games that I'd say does multitasking well,  and that adrenaline rush seeing amen on the screen, putting all hands on deck to get that last word and finish the job.  There are global leaderboards for each of the 10 bosses to add a decent degree of replayability but that's really what it has to offer, just a good experience worth supporting if you want something really unique, if you don't then perhaps hold your money though.\\n\", \"I've got a couple hundred hours playing the gathering storm, so I would say I got my money's worth. I've been playing the series basically since it came out. Civiliation 5 was really good. But I read comments about Civ 6 when it came out and it sounded like there were serious AI issues and I would have been frustrated. When the Gathering Storm expansion came out, it sounded like alot of the problems with 6 had been fixed and I gave it a shot. I've really enjoyed the Gathering Storm and would say it is the best of the series in my opinion.\\n\", 'Studio Wildcard banned a youtuber who pointed out the old bug of meshing instead of fixing the bug. Never ever gonna buy a game from them again.\\n', 'When I first saw the trailer I was immediately hooked and so far the game did not dissapoint despite the fact that I am now stuck on a bug that prevents me from controlling my idle standing character after a respawn... So I had to start over from the beginning. In my continuing playtime I also encountered a couple of weird glitches where my character suddenly just popped to another edge in the screen when I was trying to pull myself up somewhere else and there were some \"connecting\" text boxes where there was nothing to connect...  Also, as much as I love the look, it can often be pretty confusing so sometimes you don\\'t know if  something is climbable or a plattform or not... it also breaks some letters in the text what makes it hard to read especially in the introduction.  But still, combat is fun. I love the flashback-style run, jump and climb mechanics, the steam punk theme and dark retro synth wave soundtrack too much to not still like the game.   I will continue my thoughts after I finished my first playthrough.  Update: So I finished the game yesterday and I am still liking it. As soon as you know the levels the sometimes confusing visuals become less of a problem. I think there are parts that could use some polish but still this is a very rare kind of game that has its own character and doesn\\'t try to fit in with all those mainstream ones out there. I mean you have to love the club fight scene for example that reminds me of the original Old Boy movie corridor one-shot fight. There is also a rooftop chase sequence that - in combination with the music - got my heart rate pumping. I just wanted more!  So if any of that makes sense to you just buy it. I mean its 6 bucks.

I love getting immersed in quizzes set in games, and it's a bonus when they come with answers at the end.  This game is wholly a questionnaire. It's designed to put you in the moment of the story- that you are completing a test in this vague, unsettling universe. Sound design and aesthetically glitching text that varies in speed and colour as the dialogue progresses will draw you in. This game is not scary, no, but it's wonderfully fun to play. The attempt to make me jump out of my skin did not work, and I was more fond of the slow build-up trying to make my skin crawl- but hey, I saw it work on others, so it's not a bad feature for everyone. Just because it didn't get the effect out of me that it should have does not mean it was poorly placed, either. I saw what it was trying to do, and me from a few years ago would have been impressed... and anxious. Anxious in a good way.\\n\", 'from a production point of view, $20 is a pretty decent \"investment\" for the game considering how malleable it is for style and gameplay. when people tend to look at a game, they seek quantity and often overlook the quality of the early access product. the game is quite fun in my opinion and has provided me with many \"oh s***\" moments already with how much fun it can be. definitely not for the casual gamer and probably more geared to the hardcore skater with injuries, which i am one.  2.5 weeks in -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPRafjmNouI&feature=youtu.be\\n', \"Short, but great fun.   I don't understand the story at all, since the voices are in Japanese and reading the subtitles during action sequences is pretty much impossible. There's talk about some artifact and a dead guy. Between the main character passing out every few minutes for story reasons, I was not able to follow.  You're given a few ways of attacking from the start. Three guns. An assaul rifle, some kind of low spread shotgun and a pistol. You also have a sword, which attacks at a longer distance than expected. Your sword has three different kinds of attacks: Normal slash, an X-slash kinda thing, and a ground pound that knocks enemies into the air. There are other abilities to unlock as you progress too, but I didn't get them all in my first playthrough (Took roughly 50 minutes.)  Overall the platforming sections are the weakest. I had to make use of an unlockable ability that let me float in the air while firing my assault rifle in order to get past a long jump. The combat is just SO much fun though. Dashing around, firing and slashing at waves of enemies was cathartic. I will absolutely be purchasing later episodes in this series.

This is a game best suited for existing fans of the Zachtronics genre who are willing to overlook some flaws and a lack of polish to find some unique types of puzzles to solve. In a broad sense, you solve puzzles by directing a current of light through 1 to three inputs, manipulating it along the way with several tools to reach a desired output. This is, abstractly, how Zachlike games work, but Octopticom has several unique types of puzzles. I'd classify the levels, excluding the tutorials, into three areas: logic gates, color blending, and delays.  Of those types of puzzles, the delays and logic gates work great. The delays had solutions that made me feel clever, and the logic gates were rewarding and taught me about their real-life principles in computing. It was actually this aspect that convinced me to buy the game. The final 10 puzzles or so are some of the game's best, and it felt like a culmination of all I'd learned.  Unfortunately, there were some aggravating parts of the game. The color-based puzzles, perhaps a third of the game, didn't work for me at all. Their mechanics were very poorly conveyed to the player, and I struggled to understand them for a long time.   Worse, the game lacks a lot of quality of life features, especially the ability to increment your puzzle step by step. It makes testing very tedious. I had a couples bugs where all my progress on a level was deleted, but nothing took too long to rebuild.   If you'd asked me halfway through the game, I wouldn't have recommended it, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Players considering this game would be wise to consider its flaws. Inexperienced puzzle players, unless they have a background in computing and already understand logic gates, would be better of looking at any Zachtronics game first. Still, there's a good game here, and I look forward to the developer's next title.\\n\", \"This IS the skateboarding game everyone has been waiting for.

The customization is amazing even in it's early state. The idea of taking loads of goods from place to place to earn money to upgrade your truck is a very addicting mechanic.  At this stage as long as the updates keep coming in frequently this could turn out to be a real gem. My main concern at the moment is the finicky camera. I'd prefer to have the option to just have a free rotating camera. Especially when you get into tricky terrain it feels like the biggest challenge is fighting with the camera.  All in all, if you're on the fence about it, wait for a few more updates. Think of it like a Spintires/Mudrunner crossed with Jalopy with a sprinkling more customization.

Positive review reflects their attention to updates needed to ensure the game meets community standard.  Old review:  - No button/controller remapping. - Cannot change transmission type - Very arcade, joystick up is forward, joystick backward is reverse - There are no simulation elements. Like locking hubs, dropping from 4hi to 4lo, etc - You cannot modify anything about the vehicles. Like changing tire pressure - Audio for engines all sound the same, the engine revs to red line even when rpm is at 2000. Like pressing the gas just plays an mp3, there's no dynamic - Says destructible cars, but there's no basic damage like scraping against trees or rocks. - Terrain doesn't 'move'. IE hitting a tree at full speed, the tree is just a solid collider, there's no movement/fluid feel  The game has no UI, no 'feel' in the menu. You just hold joystick forward and drive over icons that either gives you fuel or food.  It feels like something you might pickup as a Unity asset and are supposed to build upon.\\n\", 'This is a better game then it should be but...

Also half the people you bone in the game do not look legal and they\\'re bleeding because it\\'s their first time. Like I don\\'t wanna see that. The good thing about hentai is supposed to be the fantasy, right?

As a super small indy dev, path finding AI may be a bit much to ask given the need for a life, but it'd be nice. 2. the screen side scrolling is super slow, which can be a bit of a nuisance navigating the very long maps.

Here are  my notes on this scam which they call DLC:  - Only one soundtrack for the Spanish theme. They couldn't differentiate between peace and war so it is played either way. I expected a lot more on the soundtrack aspect of the Spanish update  - Silly updates regarding mechanics. My 15 yro cousin could have modded it for me and I would have paid him money without feeling regret  - You just messed up the game more by ruining colonial experience. Every new DLC just increases the admin points to be consumed, making it harder to expand. It is now 1526 AD and I barely got my first Mexican colony. Caribbean already got several colonies. In former patches I used to rule the Caribbean by 1525. Big difference.  - It is already bad enough for Spain to be bankrupt in the past several patches, now it has gotten worse. I literally have no cannons (to save money), and my army amounts to 26,000 soldiers, which is exactly the same number I began with in 1444. You just can't afford it when playing Spain, or any other nation for that matter.  - Hmmm, where are the pirate mechanics? I do not see any piratey stuff or any other changes for that matter.  - They added a portrait of a Spanish king in the loading screen. Ok I'll give you $0.1 worth for the effort, but the rest of my $9.9, where is it gone towards?  - Spain was one of the golden blossoms of the 16th and 17th centuries. Why the fuck are the kings so terrible in EU4? One of the reasons why I was late to get to the colonial world is due to horrible leaders. Additionally, these silly events that drain stability keep popping up.    If you idiots for once begin to think, maybe you can revert all the damages you've done to this game the past dozen or so patches. As a starter, increase all income, and lower MP consumption. Let players enjoy their game you silly billies. From my frustration in losing $10 and plenty more, I curse Paradox and pray you and your loved ones get cancer of the eye.   First and last edit: I gave up on 1557. I saw in the mission tree of Spain that there is a mission when you finish you get Hernan Cortez as a conquistador. LOL! I am so far away from conquering the Incans, and not even 40% through with the Mexican nations, and over half of Caribbean. Morocco and Tunis are so powerful, I don't have the army to launch an offensive, and in the early stages of the game I was focused on saving MP for colonial ambitions. I have 5 merchants, with a combined army of 35,000, yet I am barely hitting the +3 income mark. I only have 1 manufactury built, and from the Hunt of the Seven Cities or whatever, I just got one gold hit with 200 ducats.... that's all.  This is an insult to the legacy Spain left in history. I am ashamed that I was part of this insult. I was dying to play Portugal after this, but I guess that would not be a good idea for my blood pressure. This is not the first or the second or even the third time that I play Spain without enjoying at all. Spain was my favorite nation to play long before the silly Common Sense update came.

With that said, all of the tricks take about 30 minutes, at most, to learn, and the map is extremely small. There is very little to do, and frankly, if I wasn't streaming the game the entire time, I would not have even played for an hour.   Usually, you'd think that 2 hours of game play is not nearly enough to describe an entire game, but in the case of this one, 2 hours is literally the entire game. There's maybe 5 rails total, a few edges, some stairs, and 1 small ramp. Maybe this would be worth $5, at most, but $20??? For a game that is basically a skating test-build?  I think that this game has a lot of potential. With that said, I think the only person that should buy this game is someone who is a huge fan of skating games and would only be buying this to support the developers. The game has a lot of potential, and I would imagine the only reason why this is released is to get funding, but really, they would have been a lot better off on a site like kickstarter.\\n\", 'The game is perfect but please add more firearms! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3\\n', 'This is a pretty fun game, interesting story, with good camera and animation.

Although I never played the Skate games, I was a huge fan of the Tony Hawk series and was always curious what the flick/joystick system would be like. This game implements the controls very well, and it was pretty intuitive to learn how to play. The game itself takes place on one open level, and leaves more exploration and customization wanting. However, in time, if they release mod capability, story mode, customization, multiplayer or co-op, more maps, and fix the bugs in movement and maps, this game will really shine and would be the rejuvenation to skate games that we've needed for so long--and it's on PC!

The temp increase talks about deforistation, but I planted 30 spots of trees and all that happened was the temp increase continued to go faster.  I had 3 sea level rises in 4 turns.  Need to fix the logic there or is it simply a political statement.  The other disasters were random and created a nice change of pace to the game.  Having to go through and rebuild after a tornado or replant after a river floods or a hurricane or volcano.  It is simply the CO2 emissions logic that is seriously flawed. \\n', 'This game is a hidden gem. It brings me back to the n64 era 3D days.

You still have to level up to earn them, but you earn stuff all the time if you have this dlc. You can also play as any shadow (if you're a free player, you can only play as whichever 4 are currently on rotation). I personally play only as the 4 on rotation even though I bought the dlc, just because I find it fun to focus on them for awhile since you'll see them a lot since all the free players will be playing them. So it helps you to really get good at playing as and against those specific shadows. The dlc is worth it if you are really into this game and think you'll play it a lot. I got it because I knew I wanted to keep playing the game, and being able to customize your bear a lot makes it more fun. You can create some cool looking characters when you have the full suite of cosmetics to choose from!\\n\", \"At first, I bought this game for the adult content and was not expecting much of anything else... What I got was nothing short of amazing. The adult content was there and in copius amounts, but the game itself is amazing and I'm talking easily in the top 5 RPG games I have EVER played in my almost 30 years of gaming. Character story development is perfection and you will fall in love with the characters that fight alongside you. Speaking of the storyline, it is extremely emotional. I'm not an emotional person and I laughed, cried, felt joy, anger, and even some hopelessness during the time I have played it. Graphics are rough, but with this story you wont need a bunch of CGI eye candy. Gameplay is turn based and there is a grind, but even the grind is never long enough to take away from the game's fun factor. The grind also will not guarantee a victory meaning that you will still need think during fights. You can easily rack up 80 hours of gameplay before you hit 100% completion. This is the best $45 I spent on a video game ever and I give it my highest recommendation. Well done Alicesoft.\\n\", \"Game mechanics aren't obvious, and no tutorial to explain anything. It might seem like such a simple game wouldn't need explaining, but that's assuming the game mechanics function the way one would expect--which they often do not.  Frustrating lack of control on some things.  Downright ridiculous lack of balancing. Who is going to want a fighter with the majority of their skills couched in defensive moves that require rrandomly getting lucky and defending against the right hit so they can counter? The counter attack does the same amount of damage as a regular hit, which has far fewer requirements for success. This is basic math, how could the developers get this so wrong?  Here's another good one: I just lost a match by decision, 47 to 21!!!! Get this: I wasn't knocked down a single time, and I knocked the opponent down 4 times. I suspect you get massive points for landing ulitmate moves? Because I STILL don't have one unlocked, yet every boxer I am faced against has it unlocked already.  Strange bugs. For example: despite the tooltip saying my speech failure rate is 15-20%, I've failed all but 4 of the last 37 days of speeches.  I see potential here, but the developers need to tighten some things up and add a bit more strategy. The only reason why I'm clicking thumbs up right now is because it's priced fairly for what they're offering. If they don't fix the very obvious problems, this is a 5 dollar game though.\\n\", 'A fantastic add on to an already great game  Pros-  Adds much needed content The new civilizations are super intresting Makes every game feel more different  Cons- On the pricey side, recommend waiting for a sale \\n', \"I was skeptical about this expansion because of the climate change system. The unrealism in Civ has always been a result of player interaction, like Gandhi nuking people or buiding the Eiffel Tower in 1543, so adding a system that would make Al Gore cream himself, with rising CO2 emissions resulting in coastal flooding and whatnot, seemed out of place. But, turns out it's not a big deal at all. The other systems far outshine that.  The return of the World Congress is a welcome one, and this time, Diplomatic Victory isn't a BS way to win. No more buying City-State votes, you need to earn favor, and favor comes from being buddies with people. Forcing you to pick one of two options on every resolution is a fascinating way to create tension and encourage diplomacy, which adds a new aspect to multiplayer games.  Making Strategic Resources once again stockpile similarly to Civ V is also a welcome change. It gives you another form of currency to use in trading, and puts a cap on how crazy you can go with your military without also focusing on infrastructure.  The weather system is great. Volcanoes are horrifying, but volcanic tiles are ridiculously fertile, so there's a risk/reward balance you need to consider. Same with rivers, which can be a huge issue until you get a Dam. Russia being invincible on Tundra tiles, which are actually useful to them, now comes with the caveat that Blizzards can happen.  The new leaders are mostly great, except Sweden. Gustavus got Waluigi'd and instead, his hideous, self-important, underpowered failure of a daughter leads Sweden. But to counter that, the most beautiful woman in Civ, Eleanor of Aquitane, can lead either France or England, which is a fun quirk, and her leader bonus is one of the most powerful in the game. The Maori start on Ocean and can always cross Ocean, which is ridiculously strong. Phoenicia can move their capital.  Finally, the AI. Holy cow. I was feeling really confident after solidly winning a few Emperor matches in the last expansion. I've lost three in a row in this one.  Overall, it's a great expansion.\\n\", \"yes this is censored. we can hope that there will be a patch soon. but this is a fun game for what it is. the ability  to watch the scenes over and over is great. i was not expecting  that. don't make up your mind just because of the mosaic. you will be missing out on a good game that has this much adult content.\\n\", \"*Spoilers?* Because one dude got mad that I mentioned the number of jumpscares in the game.  Not exactly a horror game, at least not in my opinion. It was creepy, ya, but the scares were pretty cheap. Mostly it was focused on making you paranoid about an intruder in your house, and at the moment I live in a dorm, so it didn't get to me much. Other than that there's some lovely screamy audio that gets pretty annoying after a while and... 3? cheap jumpscares in the first go through.  That said I'm still reccomending it because it's a pretty interesting idea and I think that this could be taken in an interesting direction in the future if the developer decides to push this idea farther.  May I reccomend: More body horror, would-you-rather type questions, and also fewer... screams.\\n\", \"Nyakuza Metro is a fine addition to A Hat in Time's various worlds and levels. The expansion provides a lot of new cosmetics, and a fairly laid-back experience as you traverse through the underground city. The attention to detail, easter eggs, level design, and so on are spot on, but the experience is pretty short. I can't speak to the quality of the multiplayer side of this DLC, as I haven't played it, but the meat of this expansion was always going to be the single player content for me.  Pros: + Visually gorgeous metro/underground cityscape that's rich with color  + Easter eggs scattered across the map range from movie poster parodies to character conversations to gameplay itself + Solid level design and gameplay + Most parts of the metro can be accessed in any order, with only one part of the map being barred off at first + Lots of new cosmetic options + Voice acting is well done as usual  Cons: - Relatively short game length (I'd estimate about 2 hours to get the time pieces at a leisurely pace, maybe 4-5 hours if you're really keen on exploring every inch of the city and finding all the hidden secrets) \\n\", 'Sweet and short classic-inspired horror game (I really loved the PS1-era style of graphics).

Now a bit of +/- What is cool is: -Graphic is amazing -Variety of combo and action batteling system  -Amazing combination of  sword and autometic weapon attacks  Some of minuses: -Still to short (but we should remember that it is still in early access) -To my mind, sometimes lack of enemies -Sometimes you lose points in hystory  So, to conclude, it is an amazing game. Basically, it combines DOOM, Devil May Cry, and something from Tomb Rider and as a reasult we have fast pace shooter that has you performing combos with both your guns and your abilities and all of this with cool graphics. What is more exciting here that this game crated by a single developer, of course it  has some minuses BUT all of them covered.  P.S.

I have sinked countless hours into other skate games, and have to say that there is major potential for this project. That being said, here is my list of what I like so far, and what I think should be added to the game.  What I like so far: - The control scheme, it's somewhat reminiscent of the SKATE series, but is entirely it's own. The left stick controls your left foot, and the right stick controls your right foot. Easy concept to grasp, but difficult to master. - The graphics are awesome, and the game is well optimized. I have a GTX1070 and get a constant 144fps on ultra settings. - Catch mechanic is great, and holding down a trick and having it keep spinning/flipping is perfect. - Certain tricks look and feel smooth, and you actually have hit a rail or ledge at the correct angle to grind, instead of being magnetically pulled to the rail or ledge.  What I think should be added (from most important to least important): - General stability and stiffness improvements, for both movement and tricks. - More maps, and more opportunities for vert, even if it's a few small ramps and bowls. - Online free skating with friends. - A UI that lists what trick I did - Different controller schemes (SKATE-style, customizable, etc.). - Player customization.  If you enjoy realistic skateboarding games, want to support these developers by purchasing this early version of their game, and are OK with a few bugs for the time being - definitely give this game a try!\\n\", 'pew pew 5/5\\n', 'If you can overlook lolis and r*pe, this is worth your time.

Runs start and end very quickly as you trial and error through the conversations.

You can just try to finish the game and that's a good experience.

Aside from the gorgeous work that was done to improve the game board the game play has been upgraded in a smart way. The worker units in the game have had their usefulness greatly expanded. The ability to make canals and mountain tunnels is a big overdue welcome. The new resource stockpiling engine is a smart evolution for gameplay. The civ AI has become less predictable and more interesting. And of course the global warming element really puts some serious reality into the overall experience. The various goals of the game remain the same but the process to achieve them is more balanced and suitable. Hidden techs in the end game keep science and culture alive longer which was sorely needed.  The music is weird. But that's easily substituted and I consider it a lower priority anyway. My biggest complaint would be the constant deal making the AI civs want. It would be nice to let them all know what I am and am not willing to trade so they dont keep bugging me for coal and other stuff I'll never trade to them.

This game is designed to be played with trial and error in mind, you learn from your mistakes, you understand the game mechanics, you get better everytime.

It is a good time waster. However it is not at all a complete game. This game was said to launch today on the 19th of December and it did. This, essentially, is a demo and if this game is looked after by the devs and added to, it will be come the skate game of PC.  It combines the controls between Skate and Session. The analogs are your feet and you can turn with the triggers. You may also turn with your left analog stick if the triggers don't gel with you. The graphics are beautiful and the movement is fluent.  I don't have much issue at all running the game on ultra. This game has the most potential out of all the Skate games I've played on PC thus far. If regular updates come and regular content is added this game will be a perfect 10.  At the moment it lacks any story, an open world and no customisation but I heavily stress that it is an early access game. I hope this was released by the devs to gauge how well it was going to do as well as the demand for it and with the demand it is at they will add things like a story and open world etc.  If you are looking for a complete, polished, perfect game.

Skate XL, from first glance, immediately piqued my interest and I decided to \"back\" it here in early access. For me, it\\'s everything Session was supposed to be, and I honestly reqre. The controls are solid, logical, and easy to adapt to. You can get nearly full control of the character\\'s feet and try to style out and perform tricks in similar ways to real life, and no two tricks are performed alike. The art is bright, realistic, and captures some of the California warmth. I find the game welcoming and appealing. I love that there is no score system, no trick names, no music, etc., to distract from casual and relaxing session skating. I put on a podcast and turn off my brain and simply enjoy cruising while spacing out. I don\\'t have too many games that let me do that and melt away the stress of the day, but Skate XL fits my requirements.   The current game doesn\\'t offer much to skate on, but thankfully there is a very healthy modding community on Discord that have added many fun and varied new things to skate, along with visual customization in character/board, as well as the game physics. With mod scripting controlling ollie pop, Skate XL has probably become the most realistic skateboarding game released. I am stoked to see where the devs take the game.

There's no chill and the times when you hit that save point are straight orgasmic and have us staying in there for way too long.   The game does a lot of smart things, just my only gripe is with some sections being straight-up walking simulator (or crawling simulator), and how you can just bolt through some areas completely ignoring the enemy.  I've seen gameplay of a man in the subway section only having to shoot once.  It's pretty hit or miss in it's build-up, and although the slow sections had me on edge, I can totally see the point of it being boring.    Otherwise, this game makes me and my friend want to endlessly delve into its world and story, while not wanting to touch it with a ten-foot pole. There's almost no jumpscares, just the way the game takes advantage of the imagination is genius.  What's around this corner?  Why are these hallways so long? How are all these sections so perfectly connected?  The game's a masterclass in creating eeriness, due to its sound (which has been fixed), its amazing atmosphere, its story, especially the 4th wall breakage, and confusing yet traumatizing monsters.  On top of all that come multiple endings, extra modes, and a complete package to unravel.  Thanks Pyro! Very cool.

Which is quite unacceptable for any full price game, or anything near it. Especially since there are not even any error codes to help explain the problem in the forums or the Ark websites support helpdesk.

While this game is unique and full of potential it doesn't really achieve its place due to bugs that are still there since the early access release and other things  like duping and meshing.

Granted, they do try to fix things in some cases, but the overall feel of the customer service is not good to say the least.  Some people might argue that playing on an unofficial server takes away many of the unpleasantries but i do believe that a game should be enjoyable on its own official network. It really shows the work they put in doesn't it ?\\n\", \"As in the base game, the features and game mechanics of gathering storm are well thought-out and implemented in a way that makes this feel like a complex board game. The game has taken on multiple new features in addition to the already large feature list from vanilla civ 6 and rise and fall expansion. Unfortunately, not all the features fit perfectly, which leads to a sprawling game with a lot of novelty that is a bit bloated. For the most part, however, the features of Civ 6 complement each other well and fit together nicely in a satisfying way with this new expansion.   In my opinion, the most important new features from gathering storm expansion include consumable strategic resources, power as a unique resource, and world congress (including diplomatic victory condition that is heavily tied to world congress.) Less important features (in my opinion) that add some flavor and are pretty well-implemented include climate change, environmental effects, engineering projects (i.e. canals, railroads, and mountain tunnels), expanded tech tree, near future governments, revision of previous victory conditions (i.e. science and culture victory), changes to the governors, new civilizations, and replacing the warmonger penalty with grievances system.   The important changes/additions: [list] [*] Consumable strategic resources – This is one of the best implemented and most important changes in this expansion. You’re required to spend resources on units to build them/upgrade depending on what they require (i.e. iron for swordsmen, horses for horsemen.) This goes a step further in modern eras, where not only do you need those resources to build/upgrade units, but you have a per-turn cost for owning them (i.e. 1 coal per-turn for battleship. 1 oil per-turn for plane, tank, infantry etc.). To some extent you will probably have to manage these resources because you will use some of them for power… [*] Power as a unique resource – I think this is one of the best mechanics that has been added in civ 6 overall. You now require power to gain the full benefits of many modern+ era buildings. Your power plant will supply cities that are within 6 tiles of the power plant (unfortunately, still no overlay that neatly displays this 6-tile coverage.) It will automatically convert available resources of its type (i.e. coal for coal power plant) to produce needed power for buildings within the covered area. This can lead to runaway CO2 emissions early on without fully realizing what you’ve gotten into.  [*] The world congress – Put simply, this is a positive addition to civ 6 and I don't have much to say about it. The diplomatic favor seems to work fine. You will use this favor in some ways to get diplomatic victory points… It’s a good addition to the game and helps diplomacy not suck as bad.  [/list]  Less important changes/additions: [list] [*] Climate change and environmental effects – I want to talk about this because it is a focal point for the marketing of the game and for people reviewing the game. Climate change and environmental effects were implemented cautiously, and do NOT significantly alter your game. Because of this I see them as more of a flavor to give the world a bit more life and tell a story. Climate change specifically is a feature that is also designed to send a message that 1) early adoption of coal/oil for power leads to run away CO2 emissions that are hard to stop (in my first game I was not willing to give up my coal power plants to reduce my carbon footprint), and 2) these changes are irreversible despite how much you may want to change them in the future. I reached the highest level of climate change (phase 7) by year 1760 AD, which resulted in 59 costal tiles being submerged worldwide. Submerging of select coastal tiles is the most significant effect of climate change in Civ 6 and many complaints seem to be centered on the idea that this is not severe enough punishment. Maybe Firaxis will develop some more interesting ways for climate to affect the world in Civ 6 like desertification as others have suggested, but I am content with its current implementation. [*] Engineering projects – I didn’t experiment much with canals, but the mountain tunnel pathing was a bit buggy. I had units popping out of random mountain tunnels half a continent away (I hope it’s a bug and that they fix this.) Dams and railroads are great. [*] The revision to the victory conditions seems to have drawn out the end game quite a lot. On my first playthrough, it was novel enough that I enjoyed playing the end game… though I worry it will eventually get too dull for me to finish the games. [*] The changes to governors were much needed, and overall a step in the right direction. [*] Grievances seems to work better than warmonger penalty, but I don’t have too much of an opinion on it at this point. [*] The new basic combat units seem to fit into the tech tree well.   [*]The expanded tech tree, and near-future governments don't do much for me, but they do add a bit of flavor and life to the game.  [/list]  [b] Discussion: [/b] I just want to use the rest of the review for a subjective discussion of my personal opinions on the direction Firaxis has gone with Civ 6 overall and including features I do not like.  At the beginning, I mentioned that Civ 6 is like a complex board game, and I honestly feel like that is a perfect description of the series' current direction. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel like Civ has lost some of its “grand strategy” feel as it has moved in this direction. Changes like 1-unit-per-tile, high value on single military units, governors, spys, archeologists, rock bands etc. have the effect of making you feel like you're moving pieces on a game board as opposed to simulating a unique world history. This is a stylistic choice and I have accepted it, though I sometimes am nostalgic for a civ game that provides the more grand strategy feel from earlier civ games (Especially civ 4).  Religion is implemented poorly in my opinion. Fortunately, it can be almost completely ignored if you don’t adopt a religion, but still… Faith as a resource was a bad idea that has led to obscure uses for this extremely abstract resource that make 0 sense even from the stand point of a board game (i.e. purchasing great people, national parks, and now rock bands.) Theological combat is a 100% fantasy abstraction for how religion spreads. Unfortunately, the religion system is completely baked into Civ 6 so it cannot be changed, but I just hope the next dev team goes in a different direction with religion (i.e. more subtle.)  Given that religion has a victory condition, this ties into my next point that the drive for more unique victory conditions has led to a modular approach to Civ. To be most efficient, you must decide what victory condition you will pursue as early as possible and focus on that. Attempting to diversify your empire may not prevent you from winning, but it certainly will make your win less efficient.  Final thoughts:  Civ 6 succeeds in the stylistic choice of feeling like a complex board game. This expansion adds some great features that I think were brilliantly implemented, and would consider it essential for anyone who plays civ 6 regularly. Is it worth the $40? Well, Civ is my series. I almost always buy civ games and expansions at launch. If you're like me, get it as soon as you can afford it. If money is tight, of course wait for a sale.\\n\", 'If this game gets the attention its deserving it will blow up. Feels so smooth and looks so steezy. Controlling feels intuitiv.

It can be a sort of \"Ocean\\'s Eleven on Mars\" type of story, or it can be \"expose corporate corruption sci-fi style\" story depending on your choices. One reviewer complained that the story switches gears from one to the other in the middle. It really does not. If you want to keep the plots from mixing, you have to simply be consistent in choosing the options that stick to the path you choose to play through the story. It is true the \"corporate corruption\" story line is offered later in the story, but once you switch, consistently choose the new path from then on will give you a satisfying plot to follow. Add in the various romance options and you have good replayability for a cheap price. Since I have always liked the \"professional gentleman thief\" type characters, \"The Martian Job\" is a solid buy for a surprisingly compact story.\\n', 'Amazing Game \\n', 'This game is a skateboarding sim.

Simple, but efficient strategy layer plus series of small scale tactical combats (at most 20 units on board, usually ca 8 turns) makes for fast paced game and prevent drag. Choices are minimalistic, but well implemented.   I found game reasonably simple (with beginning a bit more challenging) and needed 21 hours to reach all endings.   For negatives, there is little replayability. Game is somewhat unbalanced (submarines\" are underwhelming), AI is passable, and plays by the rules (which is nice feat for such a small game), tlhough very predictable in tactical phase.

As all the skills in Geometric May is power ups in this game. At least it prepared me well in advance to how this game would play.  Unless I missed something, this game has a lot less motivation for exploration than a regular metroidvania. The only thing to pick up is points, which can be used for gallery and powerups. Which you can get repeatedly from the same rooms if you want to. So I just went whatever route I found between the bosses until the game was cleared.  But this publishers games seem to be linked storywise so it creates a nice little world where you can get more if you buy more of the games. Which is a nice touch.  The gallery section is a vast improvement to the free to play geometrical may, making it a bit better investment now that this product cost money and isn't free. It is still not in any form amazing like the kind you can get in Visual Novels, but it is a nice bonus.  I played on the normal difficulty, and feel no need to play the game more.

When you are first playing and learning, it is easy to think of the game as \"cheap\", and your fate decided by the whims of chance, but this is not true.

The novel stars two friends, Robin and Alicia, in college. Having been friends since childhood, Robin feels its finally time to tell Alicia her biggest secret: she likes being tied up, and hopes her best friend will at least not think she's a big wierdo.   What follows is the story of how Alicia reacts to that news and how it shapes their friendship. In short: Alicia is not only fine with it, she actually offers to tie Robin up, and the pair even decide that hey, people on the internet pay money for pictures like this, so why not try it? Thus the game is split between two modes: story mode and session mode, which represents the girls selling commisioned photos of themselves as they keep up in school. As they make more money you can buy more clothes and gear to use, thus allowing you to accept more expansive and lucrative commisions. Its a nice ittle gameplay loop and the amount of stuff available in Session mode justifies the fact that the story itself only takes a little over an hour to actually read.  Whether you like bondage or not, I can say that just about anyone should at least find the story very sweet, and its a nice pick-me-up kind of visual novel. While it isn't very long, there are two endings based on the choices you make, and the writing and high quality artwork for the cutscenes and Session mode justify it in my eyes, especialy since it was made by a team of about three people.   All in all Bonds is a short but sweet little story that should please anyone who likes a little heartfelt romance with likable characters and/or people who find themselves agreeing with Robin that hey, bondage 'is' pretty fun.\\n\", 'Best DLC deal since seal the deal!\\n', 'Nice looking car but very dissapointing with its extreme lack of customization and zero decals. :(\\n', 'pyro made me buy this game, 10/10 much better than tik tok\\n', \"If you're looking to play online, don't waste your time or money.

The animations are extremely smooth, the soundtrack is well done, and there are a lot of unexpected gameplay mechanics and moments. Admittedly, I grew up when graphics like this were the norm, and I loved the aforementioned games that this draws from.  Getting further into the design, there are definitely some intentionally obtuse aspects to it -- some work, some don't.  For a negative example, take the font -- it is generally readable throughout the game, however it is practically unreadable in the very first intro screen's story text. I had to squint to read it. Thankfully that same block of story is on the store page. Elsewhere, the font is fine, but imo that singular moment was not a good first impression.  Other non-obvious aspects work better. For one, there are easy ways to beat certain sections that seem difficult at first. As an example, there is an enemy that you'd expect to have to shoot, and you only have enough bullets to kill him -- but you can easily bring him down with melee attacks. The only thing stopping you from trying the latter is the perceived threat of getting too close to him, but it's a moment where the game rewards you for using your head. Another example is that certain paths and secrets are *very* subtle to spot, but reward a keen eye.  Certain aspects of this game seem to draw strongly from memorable moments in film -- one part reminded me of the underpass machete fight from Book of Eli, another reminded me of the hammer fight from Old Boy.  I could say more, but ultimately is the game fun? This morning I loaded it up to give it a solid go, and ended up beating it twice, back-to-back.

The issues outside of that are minor.  But onto the main portion.  One of the more minor issues deals with some of the new voiced lines for the Coven. Certain lines make it clear the quality of the mic used changed. Outside of that there are a few cases of misplaced spaces, lack there of, and a handful of typos. However that is more an unfortunate circumstance than a rating dropper.  The writing. As I stated before it seems to have altered, and I\\'m not talking about the kappa sized elephant in the room. Not yet, at least. The interactions can be good, but are just as likely to come up short. Calculester is the best example of this.

As per the lunch scenes with the side characters those need work. Dimitri\\'s lunch scenes, and scenes in general, are flat. One-noted. At least the Prince in the base game had some variation if you sat with him, which honestly made me grow to like him as a character.

Dahlia at least shows some variation, and the abusive relationship representation of a character shows how toxic that can be without preaching. That latter bit I respect.  Which leads us into Leonard. He\\'s a strawman, yes. Those people are the extreme minority unless on certain sections of a website, yes. My problem with him is that there was too much success in making him the most hated character. It makes the Zoe routes a chore to get through. Honestly I just skipped the majority of Zoe\\'s scenes if I already read them once due to him. I understand why the devs included him, I saw the comment on the discord.

It\\'s an amalgamation of a number of different groups, and some of which happen to be at odds with each other.

It has just the right scale, detailed enough to allow the right mix of subtlety and replayability, while not being one of these mammoth games with a lot of tedium (and a cramp on the pause finger) that will never be finished in the end (HOI 4 I'm looking at you!).  If you want to play a World War II game which is actually finished (I would even say polished, given it is the (major) evolution of a past release), with a competent enough AI, lot of historicity and attention to details, lot of decisions (real choices, often difficult to decide in the right meaning of the word), proper scale and pace… Then that’s the game you’ll want to play (and enjoy then finish) on World War II. Then you can play against a friend for even great enjoyment (and devious strategies). This is definitively a game more involved and historical than Axis and Allies on the one hand (a decent enough game if you want some Beer and Pretzel style of gameplay). But it’s also a game that won’t come with 14 DLC to finish up Russia, United Kingdom, China, etc. It might have few minor bugs in 1.00, but god, it did not crash on me and nothing major happened adversely. It seems I know a lot about this game with only 14 hours of gaming time but given I have probably put hundreds of hours in the past games of the series, I can in good faith tell you that it just does all what the precedent iterations did, only better! And so, what is new for people having bought the previous game of the series?  The map is quite big, accurate and beautiful. You’ll identify readily the coastlines, and there is so much attention to details! They team even went to the pain of finding the names of forlorn mountain passes everywhere…  The AI is much better and is quite a competent opponent. The new extra units won’t be game changer (and that’s good) but definitively add to the replay value. The numerous decisions and events (I don’t think there is a single turn where you don’t have something to read or decide) are very well done, and they all (well 95%) come with an additional gameplay note, giving you the actual game effect (sometime quite involved) of the decisions. I mean that’s all good to know you can invade Finland as Russia, but what will be the consequences? And then if you invade it (like in most games), then the other side can do something in reaction (like when the English and French seriously considered sending actually troops).

The controls kill it completely.\\n', \"Hi, I'm 2scoopsrice and I've played ARK more than one man should. This game has many, many downsides, notably the grind to become strong, the odd game breaking bug (thank god for console commands,) and the fact that it's unreliable, and it's usually pretty difficult to load into the game, if it even loads at all. A lot of the time it just freezes, and I have to reload the game. If this game sucks so much, then why am I recommending it?   Although it's pretty rough in a lot of places, it's still very fun to play, and the DLCS add a good amount of content to mix the game up enough to where it's still the same game, and it's recognizable, but there's a lot of new mechanics to learn. And you want to know something? A lot of the stuff I complained about before is completely up to you. This is because of a slider system you can use before you generate the world. You can double the amount of resources you get, so you don't have to grind as much. Or you can half or even quarter the taming speed, so taming an animal doesn't take nearly as long. This is what I do, since I hate grinding in video games, and it's very nice to me to have the option since I don't want to wait 3 hours to tame an animal. Now, a maybe deal-breaker is the fact that most servers play on standard settings. I only play singleplayer because I dislike bases everywhere and getting murdered for no reason, but many people enjoy the multiplayer aspect of this game. Another major thing I like about this game is the uniqueness of the animals. There's your basic animals that are good at everything, and that's great, but there's also a lot of animals that fulfill a specific niche. And this isn't really annoying, since they're pretty easy to find. It's almost impossible to play the game without the animals, because they provide much more than if you were just playing with your character alone.   Sorry this was kind of convoluted and hard to read through, but that's pretty much what I think about this game. There's definitely more I haven't mentioned, so take it with a grain of salt. I do recommend this game, but probably only a percentage of people will enjoy this kind of game, and some will definitely find it too difficult, too buggy, too expensive, or too grindy to enjoy.\\n\", \"A game worth watching, still very early but does have a fair amount of content. The pace is a bit slow, although it can be improved with stats and gear.  Map is to be cleared and has various bosses and sub-mobs to finish. Is tough when under powered as the mobs don't seem to respawn and you need to find more on map before challenging the bosses, or its a long fight and with not enough potions can be very tough to do.

Pros:  *Gunplay is flawless - Recoil is nice, weapon handeling is smooth, interacting with your teammates, swapping ammo, swapping guns mid battle, its just a game changer. *Movement is super costomizable to your own play preference and they go out of their way to make it so you dont get motion sickness. *Great graphics for a VR game, objects render well and you can see all the detail you need at long distances. *Small 5v5 teams fit perfectly with this type of game, not too much going on to overwhelm you. *Maps, while there are only a few, are very different and unique and seem ballanced between the two teams; you get the advantage by playing well, not because of where you start. *Being able to eaisly communicate with your team is great, and if you choose not to talk you can turn voice chat off. *Play with bots or practice your aim in the gun rage, you dont have to play competitvely if you dont want to.  Cons: *You have to calibrate the game to your height.. Im 6'6'' basicly a moving target you can see for miles. (Sure its realistic, but not really enjoyable in a video game) If I have to drop my gun to quickly swap to a gernade or sidearm my gun falls on the ground is is next to impossible to pick up (probably due to my sensor placement) but being so tall in the game surely does affect this, and the gun will dissapier really quickly if you dont pick it back up to reduce lag. Also I had some major issues with height calibration the first time I launced the game which almost turned me off from the game for good. *Not a lot of content yet, while there are a fair selection of weapons to choose from and attachments you can put on the guns, I simply can't wait for more maps to play on.

Let's not mince word: it'll take you a little bit to understand how the Texorist wants you to play, and it's not something you're going to learn in a small period of time. You have to throw out some pre-conceived ideas out of the window, and if you do, you'll find a game that's really smartly designed in regards to its bullet hell/SHMUP mechanics, and the mixture of a typing game. It's an early candidate for an underrated list of 2019, because while the humor is good and the music is fantastic, it's the gameplay that feels like something completely different, and was hard to put down.  The mixup of having to decide on the fly whether to try to keep typing with one hand or two while dodging bullets is smart: there are times that you can get a bunch of letters in by standing still, but always have to be on your guard when things are coming up. The damage system is straight to the point but smartly done, punishing really bad positioning in ways I didn't predict. Each fight has a uniqueness to them with some fun characters, and there's not a lot of “bad” about the game. It just takes a hump to get over unlearning what you'd expect from other typing games, which is fine.   While certain elements won't blow you away, it's the uniqueness of the Texorist that makes it shine, and worth picking up for typing game fans, genre mash-up fans, or people who want something completely different in the industry.  [b]Gameplay/ Stream Footage: https://youtu.be/3zAlB5iE70w?t=175[/b]    [u] Lists: [/u] [b]Positives:[/b] [list] [*] Reasonable strategy involved in the typing elements and the movement as you have to switch between a typical typing style, one handed typing, and staying still while knocking out words to attack.  [*] The book recovery mechanism does well in giving a “shield” system while having consequences to not being able to pick it up in a period of time. Designed smartly. [*] Punishes mistypes well in taking away letters without feeling hopeless that you won't catch up.  [*] Each fight has a distinct rhythm and introduces a new twist that keeps things fresh over the game.  [*] Controller control scheme is smartly done and actually does some balancing well. Granted, you won't definitely get any quick times on that one, but it's being inclusive without alienating a subset of players...mostly. [*] Story has a twist or two that works out. Good humor. [*] Some great visuals and setpieces to make those visuals work. Good character designs and reasonable pixel artwork. [*] Subtle smartness in things like the font choice making you question if it's a d or a that actually adds some difficulty to the game in unexpected ways. Seems purposeful, and well done might I add. [*] Great soundtrack. Fantastic in fact for a typing game. Sound in general is reasonably done. [*]  [/list]  [b]Negatives:[/b] [list] [*] Reasonable learning curve due to the way the game handles, as while it's good in the long run, it takes time to get up to speed.  [*] It falls a little short on the “campiness” factor that it plays up at times.  [*] Some of the “overworld” segments were puzzle elements that were straight forward, but some really didn't make a lot of sense at times.  [*] The “interactables” in the discovery portions don't always seem like interactables at first glance and seem a little pointless at times. [/list]  [Netural] [list] [*] Due to the way the game is designed control wise, left handed players are going to have a bit of a hard time as they'll need to use the right arrow keys to move. This isn't something that the devs really could easily deal with however due to just how keyboards are, and even bindable keys wouldn't really solve the issue. It's noted for those players however.

As a skateboarder, I appreciated the semi realism that the Skate series provided. It has been 8 years since Skate 3, and I have been dreaming of a new skate game since.  This game (more like a demo) has a solid foundation, but does have a ways to go. The controls are different, and do not make much sense to me. This might not bother you, but if you are a skateboarder you may find the fakie/switch mechanics to be strange. I have played the Session demo and the controllers make so much sense that I can visualize the joystick movements of tricks I have never done, and pull them off first try.

This is probably the best-looking game with a three-colour CGA-style palette you will ever see. Animation is fluid and gorgeous, making the best use of its limited art style, especially with very clever use of lighting and dithering to give a 3D look. The entire game has a lovely cinematic feel and I simply can't praise the art enough - but it's also very hard to describe. There's also an excellent synthwave soundtrack by kiiro which makes for a very surreal experience along with the amazing art.  Gameplay flows from relaxed platforming segments to quick and visceral action, with very intuitive controls and well-crafted levels. Combat is very fluid and there are a few different weapons to try out. There are a few puzzles that are also quite easy to figure out. There were only a few points where I got a bit lost, but since the areas are not particularly large, this didn't last long.  The game is short and sweet, with a runtime of about two hours.  However, the game is not very accessible to players with disability. There are no options for rebinding keys. There are no resolution options. The game always launches in full screen (though an alt+enter moves it to windowed mode, while skipping the title screen). Some text may be hard to read due to the small font size and there are no options to change this. While I personally only had issues with the full screen, I know some who will have to give the game a pass due to these omissions. I understand that for what is supposed to be an old-school game, these are not concessions that would usually be available back in the day, but it is disappointing to be lacking any customisation options.

That way when they raid you they just destroy your above ground containers thinking thats all you have.  But really all your good stuffs under the floor boards.  You could get unlucky and they destroy those too, in that case get a purlovia.  Burrow it outside away from base a little bit, since a parasaur can detect it.  Which would be insane no one really does that.  But that\\'s a good way to hide loot to, on that.  But the best way to win PvP, is to avoid it.  It\\'s too broken to mean anything if you do happen to win anyway.  Just hide, and offline raid people.  Preferrably people who pick on new players.  Target them out first, the douches who C4 stone bases on the beach.  It is PvP but the other side of Ark is that the players are the story.  How they interact is what makes the game what it is.  We need more fun players, less players in it for their fun alone.  Pick up a player on the beach, throw him in a wooden stage you made.  Tell him it\\'s a game show, his prizes could include flak to argen tames.  If he plays it right.  I mean, you could do all sorts of things.  Its a game where you make your own fun, people DONT get that.  Its not a PvP game so much.    So if you do decide to get this game, please don\\'t be another greifing a-hole.  Learn to make your own fun.\\n', 'Garabage and scam. it\\'s ambitious how they are trying the controls and physics but even if they could get it to work smoothly its not fun feeling very crappy buggy boring cheap awful not even music? i mean seriously might as well trash this \"project\" it will take at least 5 years to polish these buggy physics and controls and even then its extremely annoying and tedious and turning with triggers? why? awful dissapointment. if you are a fan of the skate games this is not your answer.

One of the most popular and most fun physical pinball tables that just can\\'t be beat, but this is digital edition and how does it compare to other digital pinball tables?  Is there enough to do?  Yes, definitely.  Zen Studios has a few different tables that have a similar theme, particularly Epic Quest kind feels like the same idea with a Monty Python-esque sense of humor, and Excalibur in everything else.  Epic Quest is a bit simple, but and interesting experiment that they later revisited and developed in the Bethesda tables.  Although Excalibur has a more serious theme, it is more of a direct rip off Medieval and it has a lot to do.  A lot more than Medieval Madness.  But it\\'s a much more difficult table.  Many of the important shots are very difficult to make.  And I did get pretty good at it having beat nearly of the main side knight quests and main quests in separate games (excepting the quests to do with the mini-playing field which is beyond me.)  But it\\'s too difficult to be fun, and the way kickbacks work on the table is terribly frustrating.  Medieval Madness on the other hand, just hits the sweet spot.  All of the shots just seem to make sense.  They all feel like what they represent.  The moat, the castle, the catapult.  Even the ramp to save the princess feels like a tower, requiring quite a strong hit to get your ball up to the top without it falling back down.  And it\\'s such joy to have gotten to the final wizard mode when I never could have done so with quarters.  I highly recommend this pack for this table.  The other two, however...  The Getaway has kind of an interesting history, which is worth reading about.  Apparently, it\\'s based on a real car chase the designer of the game engaged in with the police.  On the other hand, it\\'s a really simple table, and it\\'s not long until you\\'ve seen its few tricks.    The Junkyard is a bit more complicated, but kinda bizarre.  The main interest, I suppose is the wrecking yard in the middle of the table.  You can hit a wrecking ball with your ball there to wreck a bunch of cars around the edges, or try to get past the wrecking ball to get other bonuses.  This requires a pretty hard hit and results in the complete loss of control over your ball, so you\\'ll probably be wanting to avoid this main feature of the table (unlike in Medieval Madness which rewards you for engaging with its toys).    Interestingly, Zen \"borrowed\" on this idea for their Secrets of the Deep table, which improved upon it by having the table with the wrecking ball be divided from the rest of the playfield with its own flippers.  This vastly decreased the penalty associated with hitting the wrecking ball. Around the edges of the wrecking yard, is actually where you\\'ll be spending most of your time in the Junkyard, these ramps and sink progress a sort of story.  apparently you\\'ve been locked in a junk yard overnight, the only way to escape is to construct a rocket out of cast off items and blast your way into space.  one cool idea of the idea is combining the different pieces of junk you find creates inventions which can then unlock new modes through their use.  For instance if you get the hair dryer and the toaster, you can collect piece of toast from a sink hole and then first at the dog house.  Then you get to play a little video mode where you try and hit the dog with the pieces of toast fired from the toast gun you made.  I mean there is definitely some creativity here.  It\\'s just too bad the layout of the table isn\\'t better.  In summation, Mediveal Madness is classic and even if it loses something by not being a physical table, it still stands up against more complicated digital tables.  The Getaway and Junkyard are certainly not without interest, but you probably won\\'t be playing and replaying them.\\n', \"The idea of this story has potential to be interesting, but the writing is flat and rushed. There's no time given to the characters or the situations given.

Just buy it.  That being said, as a 3A-game developed by one guy using UE4, there is still a lot more to be desired. The voice acting is actually more than good (am native speaker), the gameplay on the other hand IMHO needs much more care to compete with real 3A games. The weapons are desperately unbalanced and I feel like I can beat the whole gaming by using E only (A skill referencing Castlevania ). My first boss battle was a DarkSouls clone, however the boss design in DS just doesn't fit a FPS like this very well and I feel like some minor tweaks needs to be done. And while I understand the whole in-game world design as well as the puzzles are probably the developer learning from TombRaider, those puzzles are a little bit mediocore, lacks proper guidance and overall not intriguing. The load screen IMHO needs a little bit of transition at the end so it doesn't feel like the game will crash at the very next second.  Overall I rate it 8/10\\n\", \"[url=https://indiehellzone.com/]My full review is here[/url], but to sum it up, the Endless Empty is if cult classic RPG Maker game Middens was actually good.

Even so, it's easy to place nostalgia goggles on, but I am happy to say that it holds up very well today, especially considering the indie market we live in.   The graphics and animations were ground breaking at the time, yet still look great, even without the new filters. Coupled with the action/adventure puzzle solving, the story is engrossing but subtle, much like other games that are close counter-parts (Another World, Prince of Persia etc).  Fantastic price and great enhancement features gives fans and new comers all the reasons to jump into this sci-fi classic of video gaming history.\\n\", 'In future it might be good game, but now it miss some things like soundtrack, game speed and options for sound.

The autosave isn\\'t perfect, and it isn\\'t obvious that autosave is a feature when you first encounter a bug that stops play until you go back through the Main Menu and select Continue. Having a \"Save\" button in the ingame menus would be awesome.  The number of days that games sell for could be lengthened. Some hints about which categories go together when researching games would also be nice, but not troublesome. The research speed on the game development and marketing skills is far too low, with 4 hours of play not moving it off the first skill level while the others are 8-9 or so by that point.  The availability of 6 timeslots in a day make it very slow to progress, particularly when two are used for food and coffee early on. Could change it up to 8 and rebalance the rest of the game around that.\\n', \"[h1] First non-hentai game I have climaxed to [/h1] This game is pure exstasy. When I say game, I'm talking about the game engine that makes the skateboarding possible. There is not much of a game here. In fact, the only level provided is bare-bones and disappointing. That's where the modding scene comes in. There are so many quality maps made by the community! Several dozen!  Anyway as far as the skating goes, the mechanics are difficult to master to the point where it is frustrating. But after a week or two, your patience will pay off. It finally clicked today and it is amazing how precise tricks become second nature. Do a kickflip noseslide down the rail, followed by a varial heel across the gap! It just works!  This game is not for babies but being on a certain spectrum is recommended.\\n\", \"A good surprise among H-games, for this game is actually a well put together RPG. For a game who's main focus is sex scenes the creators certainly put a good amount of effort into all the other aspects of the game. The characters are all lovable and hilarious, with the main character being the prime example because of his main goal being to sleep with as many woman as possible while still being an all around good guy. The other main characters, with almost all of them being women, are characters all their own and you get a good feel of there personality and their role in the game's story. It's great that the game takes time to develop all the female characters before, during, and after having sex with the main character. The story is pretty good, if you've played other JRPG's the worldbuilding is very similar. The gameplay is very much like standard turn-based RPG, with a sprinkle of uniqueness just enough for you to have to form strategies using the abilities and strengths of your party members.   All in all, it's a good H-game that didn't get lazy on the game aspect. At the best, you get a great H-game with good gameplay and plenty, and i mean plenty of scenes. At the worst, you get a bunch of H-scenes with an adequate RPG you need to play to progress.\\n\", \"This is the best naval game I've played. No fools!

So, let's start with some of the better things included in the DLC.  For one, the increased focus on naval combat is very much appreciated, making it something better worth investing in, especially with brand new flagships, which offer greater naval bonuses that can apply to your whole fleet, and which you can customize from additional guns, reinforced hulls, a taller crow's nest for greater combat width, etc.  However, I it's still not at a point where I'd say maritime or naval ideas are really worth it unless you plan on making an island fortress empire.  Another great feature though is expulsion, which is a great mechanic that allows you to expel any minorities in terms of culture/religion who may be giving your core empire problems, and send them to the new world (can't expel them to African or Asian colonies, just new world), getting them a new home and out of your hair.  However, I feel that if it is possible, the AI countries should have their tendency to use this based on their history, as at times it has led to plays where the AI is genius, but it can seem game breaking.  For example, when Spain inherits the Netherlands from Burgundy, check back in on this territory in about 75 years, since they'll make it full cores, and ensure all of the Dutch are not in Amsterdam, but New Amsterdam, leading to an incredibly powerful Spain since the Dutch War of Independence never fires, and since they buddy up with Austria, they'll just get to keep it, weakening your chances at a strong HRE if you plan on playing in it.  Honestly though, I'd say the best changes are to the Barbary Coast, whose primary powers, Tunis and Morocco, finally get their own ideas and mission trees, finally cementing them as regional powers who have a better chance at competing with their Iberian counterparts.  Now let's talk about the underwhelming stuff, starting with what sounded like it was going to be one of the coolest government types ever: pirate republics.  Honestly, if you wanna roleplay as the criminal empire, go right ahead, it can be fun, but overall... it's not that great.  For one, you won't have any estates, exchanging it for factions kind of like the ones you'd have as the emperor of China.  Because of this, you may get some bonuses, as well as occasional events to aid you in your endeavors, but nothing like 150 monarch points every 20 years, the ability to call up a great general or admiral, etc.  Overall, they're only real advantage could be the ability to raid and better privateering capabilities, as well as some unique reforms, but other than that, there isn't too much.  Another feature I'd say is kind of underwhelming is the holy order concept, simply because it's just restricted to Iberian nations, limiting how often somebody will actally get to utilize their bonuses.  Maybe if any nation could get these by fitting some requirements, then I'd say it's worth it, like if you complete religious ideas, if you pick a certain reform, or maybe associate with a government type.  As for the textures and designs, I'd say it's up to the player as to whether they like them and if they're needed.  Personally, I enjoy having a greater variety of unit appearances in my game, so it's kind of a bonus if you want that.  Other than that though, as well as the features listed above, I would recommend this immersion pack to anyone who asks.  However, I'd include a caveat saying this is something whose value is in more accordance with an on-sale price of about $5, as while it is enjoyable, it's features only be utilized depnding on location, with only holy orders reserved for Iberia, flagships offered for coastal nations, expulsion for colonial empires looking to the Americas, and nothing really for a land-locked German duchy in the HRE.\\n\", 'Nice Game\\n', 'Fair warning: I\\'ve never written a review before.  Phew - no.   First and foremost: I love RTS games, I earned my money playing them and creating content for them, I enjoy to play them and I love grand fantasy stories which is why I always take it with a grain of salt that most of the better RTS of recent years have been in sci-fi/modern era settings.   The trailer for Loria came along and I was interested - the graphics weren\\'t necessarily what I would have liked but the whole thing was charming enough.  I bought it with the launch discount, which gave it a very fair price and just finished the campaigns while travelling with my old-ish laptop.  [u]Gameplay[/u] The [b]basic mechanics[/b] work alright, you can select up to 24 units, there\\'s attack move, you can tab through your units. The devil\\'s in the detail:   The [b]pathfinding[/b] is alright as long as there aren\\'t any ramps, rivers, trees, fences, fairies or pebbles in the way. Especially on later campaign maps your units just tend to run around aimlessly, get stuck on the ramp, inside of each other (not as exciting as it sounds) and seem to be unable to move.   That you can [b]tab through your units[/b] is awesome and something I\\'m very used to. What I\\'m not used to is that units like Knights, that have no active abilities, are in the second slot while spellcasters like Clerics are in one of the last slots. Other games do this very intuitively where the spellcasters are at the front.  The [b]hotkeys for your heroes[/b] as F1 and F2 is traditional. What isn\\'t traditional is that your hero doesn\\'t get selected for immediate use when he\\'s in your current control group. (i.E.: you have your whole army with 10 units and two heroes selected. You hit F2, the camera centers on your second hero but you can\\'t use his abilities because the focus window is still on your first hero).   The [b]hotkeys in general[/b] annoy me as well - I don\\'t want to hit P for Peasant, I want to hit Q for the icon in the upper left corner. I understand that this might be not as important for many players, but I thought I note it (and the fact that you can\\'t seem to customize your hotkeys either).  That your units [b]promote[/b] with enough XP to deal more damage and be sturdier is a good thing, but as soon as they promote they also heal back to full which, coming back to air units, makes for tons of hilarious situations where you can raid the enemies workers to heal your units back to full. It also makes for weird and powerful swings when a hero dies since that often triggers plenty of level-ups for the units that were around for the kill, healing them back up to full in the middle of the fight.  The [b]AI[/b] is servicable for the most part, it rebuilds what you destroy (mostly exactly where you destroyed it, often while you\\'re still there) and doesn\\'t seem to cheat as far as I could tell, so that\\'s a plus. It does, however, fall apart completely against air. With the mixture of pathing issues for it\\'s units and the fact that it often trickles in units as soon as you\\'re in range and pulling in units like catapults to defend you can trivialize most content as soon as you get some flying units on the field.  Finally there are some minor annoyances like why isn\\'t there a display for how many workers are in a goldmine, why do I get an audio cue \"Research complete\" but can\\'t see what it is, units stopping their current attack when you give another attack-move, air units awkwardly teleporting a few meters every now and again and so on and so forth.  But overall: still servicable, enough to let me enjoy a decent story but it feels like a chore to play. If this had multiplayer then I would have a hard time to bring myself to wrestle with mechanics that cumbersome game in and game out.  [u]The campaign[/u]  Oh boy. You decide to stay away from multiplayer: understandable, you\\'re up front about it, why not.   The campaign starts out decent enough: the intro video is great, giving the main protagonist a bit of a funny / macho vibe works well enough and the first missions are interesting enough with a bit of banter, some units straight out of Warcraft and so on.   But the whole thing quickly gets a little disjointed: practically every mission ends with you destroying the last building/killing the last unit, cut to black, campaign map.   Warcraft 2/3, which this game has taken 85% of it\\'s everything from anyway, does this much better: there are some final words from the heroes, the overall story gets moved forward with some text on a scroll that gets read to you, it manages to inspire a sense of greatness and the fact that you ARE shaping a fantasy world, that this game ... has a hard time achieving. The dialogue is almost nonexistant after the third mission, even after the first one it gets very sporadic.  For example (mild spoilers):   the 7th mission of the human campaign has you fighting an epic battle against several enemy bases. You destroy the last building, the score board pops up, you go back to the campaign screen where the next and final mission is selected. It has a one-liner as a description, you hit play and you land on the map with the objective \"Destroy the red base\" in the upper left corner. That\\'s it. That\\'s all the suspense you get for the final confrontation of the game.  Or someone agrees to help you, your ally is uncertain if they can be trusted, 2.5 seconds later they prove their trust - any further comments? No. Some knights come charging in, old friends of the protagonist showing up to hunt him down. You defeat them. Any words on that? Nah, you slaughter old friends wordlessly and just carry on.  You come back to defend the capital, you charge in to help out the rallying defenders of the city. Any comment on that? Nah.   There are several months of war waging between your faction and the enemy faction. How is that explained in game? A single sentence. A SINGLE sentence.   The game shows that it had great voice actors and a decent idea to get a unique story off the ground. The game even shows you in the first two missions that it\\'s able to react to certain situations with some hero chatter, to spawn units and so on - it just got abandoned after a small taste of the whole thing.  [u]Final thoughts[/u]  The decision to skip multiplayer should have led to a tight single player campaign. Sadly that isn\\'t done with slapping together 8/16 maps, adding 10 lines in the first two missions and then just make me kill base after base whose most notable increase in difficulty is the fact that my army is almost incapable of traversing any ramp.   Some minor thing like skirmish only on 5 maps, the cumbersome control issues mentioned earlier and smaller annoyances just pile up to make me not that interested in the game.   Overall I can\\'t recommend this game but I have high hopes for the developer. I always appreciate a newcomer to the genre, the basic ideas were great (even if scavenged from certain other games) and I think that they\\'ll achieve good things if they can get someone on-board that keeps the campaign engaging throughout.  And most importantly: those guys managed to finish a game and put it out there, something that is commendable in itself.\\n', \"Its a really fun game and i like playing it, especially with the taming of dinosarus' and other thing like that i think its a game you should try out \\n\", 'for this games price it was very reasonable it was a good time with me and my friends i really enjoyed recommend this to players looking to have some fun with friends\\n', 'Not a game, but a short demo that really needs some work before it can be sold as a product.

This is for you. \"Official Vanilla Servers\" tend to be very grindy and laden with people who will grief and try to annoy so #1 I recommend to find a good un-official server.    The graphics in ark can be stunning provided you have a decent rig.  This game is best played with friends, though if you like solo the single player can be fun as well.  The idea is to evolve from the stone age to the level of high tech.  You tame different beasts to serve a specific purpose.  The beasts (dinosaurs and other animals) serve as tools to simplify and expedite tasks.  The build is so so but is best experienced with a mod called S+.  If you liked Conan Exiles you will like ark.  The combat is much more fluid, though from time to time you can hit creatures with arrows and they do not register.  Take your time to learn whistle commands for your tamed creatures as this will aid in your survival.  Conquer the Obelisk guardians and transfer your character to the next Ark.

There is no training or anything like that. To learn how to play, you need to read the user manual and watch some tutorial videos. In general, the game is nothing complicated, but you need to spend your time to figure it out. For a fan of naval war games like me, this is not a problem.  No less important point on which depends the perception of the game - this is not a commercial project and this is not an indie. I bought the first game of this Ironclads series, when nobody heard about indie devs. All the money from the sale are investing in the new games in free time. Developers are actively communicating with players in social networks and forums as Grogheads, Subsim, Octopus, SimHQ etc.  I did not have any technical problems. There is a large selection of graphics options. Saving and loading work fine. This is the most beautiful naval sim and war game I've ever seen. The change of weather and the effect of waves on the ship are very realistic. I like it.  The UI of the Ironclads series has not changed for several years. On the one hand, he does his job well. On the other hand, everything is too small - both icons and fonts. I think that this game can be called historical war game. The developers responsibly approached the modeling of the situation around Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands at the beginning of the Russian-Japanese war. 3d ship models correspond to their historical prototypes.  It is interesting to play strategy. The computer opponent tries to use all his strengths and does not forgive mistakes. I remember that some players do not like the ship movement system. Here everything is unchanged. This game has its own rules. Sometimes they are pretty abstract, but with this you can play and have fun.  Playing the simulator is not boring. In this era, there were already fast warships, rapid-fire cannons and torpedoes. Usually you spend from 30 minutes to one hour for each fight.  Generally, it is a short game. For 5-6 hours you can finish the game for one of the parties. That is, it takes about 12 hours to play for Russia and Japan. Of course, you can play more than once. Every time there is a new situation.  I like this game and I recommend it to lovers of old-fashioned naval games. \\n\", \"I didn't get the recently released dlcs (accelerator and MyPlayer kickstart) and probably the same will happen with the upcoming packs too.

Edit: today I saw Vore2K's thread on the game's general discussions page which was about that the season pass has been fixed and it should be working now for everyone, I've relogged into steam and finally the dlcs are working properly, so I change my rating to positive.

I\\'d use them for a background, if only they weren\\'t stuck in a PDF document. The girl pictures look okay, but I can get similar (if not the same) pictures by just playing the game.  The issue with this DLC is false-advertising. Not only is the description wrong, but there are no screenshots which relate to this \"DLC\\'s\" content.

In the comments on this video, several people suggested to clear running programs and exit Steam immediately upon startup of the game, etc. Again, I don't believe anyone should have to go to such lengths to play a game at it's lowest setting. I have no idea if the content or game play is good because I wasn't actually able to play it.

I can\\'t get too mad at it. If you\\'re okay with a LOT of clunkiness and frustration you could spend $3 in many worse ways.  HOWEVER!  Grim Nights is a annoying hurry-up-and-wait exercise, with minutes of twiddling your thumbs between every panicked scramble to save an idiot villager with no sense of self-preservation. Success seems to be HIGHLY dependent on RNG; you might get several +2 workers on day 1, or you might get nothing but \"this guy\\'s very slow! ha ha!\" You may find plenty of treasure chests for potions you need to make your combat units effective past day 2, or you may not. You may receive villagers with a damage buff, or you may not. And all these dice rolls need to go in your favor for you to have a fighting chance.  Of course, even if the numbers work out your archers still need to be manually ordered to stop firing uselessly into enemy shields, every time. Your miners need to be manually ordered to RUN AWAY FROM ZOMBIES, every time. It\\'s like playing Lemmings, if Lemmings occasionally rolled a d20 and you just lost the level if the roll was less than 15.  Every monster other than the base generic zombie is designed to add more micromanagement to the combat. Micromanagement has no sensible place in this game because picking individual units out of a crowd is... ugh!  You can tell from the screenshots that everything is tiny and fiddly, but what you can\\'t tell from screens or video is how goddamn finicky the cursor is. Trying to click on a worker that\\'s in motion is a pain in the ass; you have to draw a box around them. A fairly large box, too; a person-sized box won\\'t select them.

Quite cute, and enjoyable, but I do have a few points that I want to address for potential buyers:  - Don't expect a *deep* story.

'Mine' instead of 'Wine' in an instance, and a rather funny instance of '...me father', which had me giggling at the idea of the character in question speaking with a stereotypical Scottish accent. It's minor, but I have only completed one run, so there may be more. - The skip option is slow. Period. Multiple playthroughs may be a bit of a hassle because of this, and with multiple endings, well...  These are the main gripes that I have with the game, albeit minor they may be. The developer has said that they are still working on the game, adding additional story content for free later, so I may update this then.

I\\'ve probably logged thousands of hours into Skate 1, 2, and 3, with emphasis on 1 and 2 because I enjoy the realism that Skate 3 didn\\'t offer. I\\'ve also street skated for 15+ years so I hope you can trust my review.   This game has enormous potential and I already see it outperforming EA once it gets polished. I got tired of playing Skate since I\\'d say I mastered it and could do any trick I imagined first try usually. Not so with this game which I love. It feels a lot more like a real skate session with the frustration that typically accompanies them. It took a bit to learn the controls and I still have a ways to go but I learned them well enough to do all of the basics in street skating within the first half hour. That being said, here\\'s a list of things I enjoy and things I would suggest fixing or adding...  PROS: - Graphics are amazing. My middle-shelf gaming laptop runs this game very smoothly with no overheating issues so far.  - The creativity that this game and its controls allows is the thing that I believe will trump EA\\'s franchise. The option to control both feet and catch tricks in various ways is great. Skateboarding is an art form, and the fact that this game allows you to do the same trick in so many subtly different ways is exactly what a skatebording game needs. With slight adjustments to animations on some of the flip tricks, it should be gold. The flip animations are amazing already which is not what I expected in early access. Keep it up! - Truck tweaking on grinds is so satisfying and something I wished EA would have added. I definitely expanded the first time I locked into a kickflip front crook.  - Fall animations aren\\'t bad. Realistic for the most part. - Tricks feel a lot more rewarding than THPS or Skate games simply because they\\'re much more challenging.  -  I love the team\\'s plan to add famous west coast spots. Please consider spots like hollywood high, el toro, wallenberg, carlsbad, etc. And PLEASE make it as open world as you can manage. That\\'s what EA\\'s Skate nailed.   CONS or things to consider adding: -Add option to hop off board and run -Allow auto spawning near where you fell like in Skate instead of back at the spot marker. I often forgot to reposition the marker after skating across the map and had to go all the way back after falling.  -Grind physics are a  bit wonky. Keep center of gravity in mind and don\\'t let someone tailslide a ledge when most or all of the weight is off of the ledge. I also found that boardsliding rails makes a truck grinding or ledge boardsliding noise. Please add railslide sound effect. -Don\\'t be afraid to copy EA\\'s Skate in certain ways (off board option, replay mode, etc.) -Multiplayer/co-op could be very fun. If you add multiplayer, don\\'t restrict it to open servers. I can see it being cancerous. Allow private sessions with friends. Also, games of S.K.A.T.E. in this game could be much more fun and challenging than they were in Skate games.  -Add body movements when skater is in popping position. Currently looks too stiff. Also add a bit more arm movement when pushing around so I don\\'t feel like Michael Cera on a skateboard.  -Add option to remove motion blur. I wasn\\'t crazy about it. -Add powerslide options to slow down and same physics when doing tricks. E.g. What I loved about EA\\'s Skate was finding the perfect pocket to be able to \"skrrrrrt\" during a tailslide 270 out. Please consider adding this effect for maximum oversteez.  -The \"faster spin\" controls don\\'t feel right. I\\'m not sure if it would compromise the control settings as they are, but consider changing the last control step to ← ←  or → → instead of ← →. Feels more natural this way.   Apologies if some of these suggestions already exist and I just haven\\'t found them.   TLDR: If you like realistic skateboarding games, buy this game. I can imagine that by the time they fully release next year, I won\\'t want to play any other game. If you\\'re a diehard THPS fanatic, you probably won\\'t enjoy this.   Huge thanks to the dev team for picking up EA\\'s slack! I\\'m very excited to see where you take this and am proud to be supporting you at this stage. \\n', \"Buggy mess with developers who don't give a shit so long as they continue making money from it.

It\\'s no walking sim, with actual combat and secrets. Feels like a first person Silent Hill 1.  Now what I don\\'t like... The game\\'s pretty short. First playthrough was around 4 hours and subsequent playthroughs were only an hour each. Pretty fun but also short. The soundtrack also feels like it\\'s trying too hard to have the silent hill feel. It sounds like someone recreating Akira Yamaoka\\'s work but with slightly less effect, as the soundtrack feels ill-fitting on some parts. Walking down a creepy hallway while bass tunes start has less of an effect than when similar tunes kick in during important moments in SIlent Hill.

It\\'s a memorable and horrific experience.

Glitches and poor translation lead to some unintended humor.  Game is short. Only a dollar though, so it's worth it if you're curious.  So this game is a little rough around the edges. The actual controls and gameplay are fine as far as FPS games go, nothing that stands out, but nothing bad either. The idea of having a medic with you in a horror game setting is pretty interesting. Nagase auto-heals you if you're close to her but she can't heal herself. That's actually a cool mechanic, in theory. The stress comes more from trying to keep her alive rather than yourself. Except it doesn't end up playing that way. This game isn't really about firefights, so keeping her alive is never too tough.  It's worth mentioning that, officially, this game doesn't contain jumpscares, but all enemies, and Nagase, move silently so there is a good chance of something sneaking up on you. I shot Nagase like three times on accident (and maybe screamed a little).   The story seems like it could be interesting but the english translation is poor. The grammar and spelling is actually fine, but it's all summaries of information, whereas it was clearly meant to be dialogue between characters in the original Japanese.  The graphics are basic but there are a fair amount of custom assets, namely the character models.  Honestly, I went back and forth on whether to recommend this one or not but there's very little about this game that's truly bad. It's mostly bland, with a few cool ideas that were attempted. The developer clearly did the best they could. The lengthy game description on the store page and the low price point also shows their honesty about the final product. If you're curious, give it a shot. Otherwise, maybe wait for future games from Sonic-Alpha to see how they improve.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz-e_m7gadw\\n\", 'I spend not much time with the game because of two mechanics that breaks the game for me. One of them is ,the character can become paranoid and if it kicks in you can’t move for a moment. If this happens in the moment you want to passing by a place there is a lightning that can kill you then you can repeat the hole level. Same thing if you get chased, this was so annoying. There is a possibility to heal you, but that isn’t helping much if the place to do so is on the other end of the level. The second thing I don’t like is, that you can’t save your progress in the level itself.\\n', \"This game is INSANE.  After endless hours of skate 2/3 and also session i can say this game is next level.

And that’s a good thing – growing up with adventure games not only helped me with reading comprehension, but it also helped teach me how to ask questions, solve problems, and approach different personalities. It’s clear that this title takes aim at younger audiences, but there’s still an appetizer of innocent fun here for kids of any age.   The Haunted Island costs the same amount as a large coffee, and that’s a small price to pay for a member of a new generation to take interest in a long-standing category of gaming goodness.

This game is a bit on the glitchy side, you can barely touch a lamp post and it can catch your shoulder and throw you off your board and restart you at your checkpoint or the starting area, and it does take time to respawn as it takes a solid 3 to 5 seconds, this cannot be sped up. I think ways to easily balance out these cons is by adding in more tricks like the possibility of a dark slide or finger flips somehow, as it does have its con and your skater is about as likely to fall over as hit as to make donuts all the time or hol horse to be too overpowered. it does have an inbetween, while there may only be one map there is quite a bit in that map and even tutorials that are very specific on how to do each trick and how to improve your skating, the board itself is pretty responive and you can pull off crisp lines as well. Sometimes your legs glitch out and even save your line because the footing isn't fully alligned with the board, and yes in this game for once its actually easy to do a manual, just tricky still of course.

To preface, I\\'ve dabbled in Pavlov, Arizona Sunshine, Raw Data, BAM, Stand Out, the recent Zero Caliber, and most especially Onward. In fact it\\'s absolutely safe to say Onward\\'s my favorite VR game period.  Why? Well, it comes down to 3 core factors: Human-Friendly/Comfortable Game Design, Attention to Detail, and Strong Community.  Contractors already comes out swinging very strong on the first two pillars, and I sincerely hope people give it a chance in order to build that third pillar because this game\\'s doing a lot right.  --- Human-Friendly/Comfortable Game Design ---  A lot of VR FPS\\'s don\\'t work great in VR due to a number of combining ingredients that take a very careful hand to mix right. It comes down to elements like how the guns handle and feel, to level design, UI, and more, but VR comes with the added challenge of balancing gameplay to human stamina, dexterity, and exhaustion, along with consideration of the physical space around the player (not to mention those pesky tether cables).  For comparison, Onward features subtle and not-so-subtle pieces that make it a comfortable experience to play, and for long stretches. Simple things like box-like or oval-like lane-based level layouts that make the players face generally one direction without a need to rotate and get disoriented in the playspace, orienting the forward orientation of the playspace toward the enemy team every respawn, one life systems that allow dead spectators to rest their legs, and most importantly, the pace of the game itself. Onward specializes in being a game about good positioning and aim placement over fast reflexes and a lot of physical exertion. This is what keeps it being comfortable for long stretches.  So how does Contractors do well in this department? For one it\\'s got stellar gun handling and feedback. The game has controllable recoil, attachment points of the hands/controllers to the weapon that aren\\'t too sticky or \"loose,\" a lot of precision in which parts of the gun you\\'re manipulating (though magazines still are inconsistently finnicky, leading to a lot of accidental grabs when trying to pull bolts on, say, sniper rifles. Generally though, most guns handle very well), and something even Onward struggles with is great, generous sights and scopes on the weapons. It also manages to cut a lot of the potential \"tremble\" or \"drift\" that can occur with very high precision of weapon handling, leading to the occasional misplaced shots.  Guns also sound distinct, and a lot punchier. They have very detailed models, the amount of recoil gives the guns kick that doesn\\'t feel artificial or bouncy (i.e. Pavlov), being very controllable. And the amount of feedback in the controllers\\' haptics as well as whatever gets hit by the weapons adds to a lot of the power and weight that makes every gun feel satisfying to use. There\\'s even little details in the guns that make them feel more tangible and fun to manipulate, such as multiple hand placements for the offhand (such as the barrel of the gun or on the magazine) or the ability to slap the bolt release.  There are other touches that I\\'ll leave for the \"Attention to Detail\" segment, but the game also has plenty of design elements that add to the comfort levels. These include narrow levels with singular objectives that keep you focused on one direction, eliminating a lot of the disorientation of turning in the playspace, or with the map, or getting tangled in cords. The UI also is very friendly, easy on the eyes, while also being fairly detailed. Even adding a firing range right in the main menu is a welcome touch.  All in all the game *feels* great to play and it doesn\\'t force excess energy on the player. However, one major quip I have has to do with the balance of spawn location, to travel time to objectives, to spawn times. Way too often the interim between fights is way, way too long while engagements are too short (due to a short time to kill, which in itself is what makes the guns feel fun and satisfying to use), creating a rhythm that may simply take getting used to, but it isn\\'t friendly on the legs as there are no great baked-in rest periods except match endings, loading screens, and beginnings. As it stands the game is hard to play for long stretches as you\\'re always on alert and standing between respawns, but spending a lot of downtime not getting into fights. With some more dialing of the spawn times, travel time, and spawn location to shorten things to like 20-30 seconds between getting into the next fight would go a long way.  --- Attention to Detail ---  I love the aesthetic of this game. It looks bright, sharp, and full of detail thanks to lushly cluttered levels, colors that pop, and a slick green-grey aesthetic of the UI. The levels also feel very distinct and grand, from the city\\'s upper and lower pathways, interior rooms to exterior alleyways full of cars and pillars, the amount of pathways through this and the other featured maps give a lot of routes and options for ambushes to create interesting skirmishes in a variety of hotspots.  There are additional features that are welcome add-ins, such as a slide mechanic by going into a sprint and physically crouching to make your character slide a few feet while shooting. You can hold your weapon by the clip or the barrel with a lot of rifles and some SMG\\'s. Guns reload in similar ways to their real-world counterparts, some dropping the magazines upon hitting the release, while others need to be pulled out. They also don\\'t fire at all when pressed up into a wall (though sometimes can work against the player). The loadout system offers a lot of options and tactical considerations between the weapons themselves, the attachments, and sidearms and gadgets like grenades, and having the weapons\\' ballistics, fire rate, and other info on display keep the game feeling satisfyingly transparant with the player (though there could be a + or - value of how many points are being gained or lost by adding attachments or swapping weapons. You\\'re only given the flat point value of the item with no obvious way to track what points have been spent on what and how many you have left \\'til you go over).  The animations of the sprinting and sliding look smooth and swell, the player models look pretty well put together, though still have the weird knee-bending and an odd case of the glitchy arm bending about the wrong way. It\\'s quite different from how Onward\\'s stance animations work and look, but otherwise holds up pretty well.  In summary, there\\'s a lot that\\'s pleasing on the eyes, the ears, and in your digital grips with what you can manipulate in regards to your firearm. There could be more interactivity with the map itself, but it\\'s honestly unnecessary to the tight gunplay and wealth of player mechanics.  --- Community ---  At the moment there are handfuls of matches running every day, but it remains to be seen how that sticks. There were some bugs with the voice chat, both proximity and the radio, but they\\'ve gradually been getting smoothed out at the time of this writing. Players are generally cool and there\\'s more new players every day coming to check things out, and so long as the game continues to receive support, I think there\\'s a possibility for growth and a good playerbase behind Contractors. To be frank, I think the game could stand to include a few more players to its\\' large maps (to help create more frequent engagements and bigger action if the spawn timers/travel times/spawn locations don\\'t change much).  --- Summary ---  Onward\\'s been a hard game to dethrone because of how well all the pieces of that game came together, but Contractors managed to figure out that secret formula and while making their own tweaks and going above and beyond on presentation. This is seriously one to watch out for as it develops.   Do NOT pass up Contractors if you love VR FPS\\'s!\\n', 'Really fantastic !! , and i need more like this game !!!!!!!!!!!!\\n', 'Meta? mesh.

It's a must-buy for history fans and for anyone looking for something not too complicated but with a learning curve, where you can play a few games and have some stories to tell about that time the US was so angry with my trade agreement with Central America, they invaded it and lost many troops and stability at home sustaining that war. Or that time the USSR sweeped in the Middle-East because of the Iran-Iraq war. Also, who wouldn't want to prematurely reunify Germany or Korea?

You get a little more running speed and more height on the jump, which - combined with the springs and jumps populating the world - give it a speedy flow, distinguishing it from the aforementioned titles. When you can't buy Mario or DK on Steam, emulating Mario and DK is not the worst thing. This is the closest experience I've found to it, and that put that put a smile on my face.  The game encourages lots of exploration with hidden walls and doors, and is quite rewarding when you find them. Music is perhaps the only thing that lacks a little. It's not bad, but when the game stands up to Mario and DK mechanically, the music can feel lacking.  All in all if this had 10x more content it could be my favourite 2D platformer on steam.

The market for these games on the PC platform is quite sparse, and I respect the developer and the publisher for considering this platform and bringing it on Steam. A notable feature is the key notes, so how well a song plays is tied to how well you play the game yourself. Not bad!  It\\'s a pretty simple rhythm game. Two difficulty options, two chart types for 4 keys and 6 keys. Most mobile rhythm games have at least three options, four if they\\'re generous. Not a problem by itself, and you have a lot of hard songs to choose from, but this means that very easy charts that are on Hard will not be relevant to you when you get to higher playing levels.  The gap between \"Exact\" and \"Great\" hits is super lenient, and it\\'s harder to be off-rhythm than actually being on rhythm.  What you have is a pretty casual experience.  But I like it, simply because it\\'s an actual, official rhythm game release. Songs and charts released for it have went through quality assurance by people trained to actually make charts for it, compared to the likes of Osu, Stepmania, or LR2, where picking a chart out of 12 charts for one song is a whole roulette whether if it will be actually decent to play, and if it will stay consistent in gameplay style compared to the hundreds of other charts you have installed.  It\\'s also simple, requiring only keyboard keys to play (and nothing else), so you don\\'t need to cash out for an expensive proprietary console to be any good at it, and you can be certain that high-ranking players in the rankings of this song plays the exact same way as you do. Osu rankings are too unreliable, since players with a tablet and pen will always beat out everyone. Don\\'t need to worry about anything like that here.

Gameplay is solid, intuitive, and makes you feel like a you're the overpowered main character of an anime. Fights feel like action sequences and whether you prefer gunplay or using the sword there is an enjoyable gameplay flow.   The only qualms at this point are honestly just UX- Subtitles and in-game text need localization fixes and there really should be keybinding, but early access is early access.

I played Balance of Power a few years ago and loved it.  The only downside was that it was so short.  So I was really excited when I saw this game.  I like the art style a lot, and it's a lot easier to get around than Balance of Power ever was.  But I just can't get into it.  It feels like a step backwards from the 30 year old game that inspired it.  Resources, armies, and actions all feel so game-y and simplified.  30 years ago I could specify the exact amount of foreign aid I wanted to send, the number of troops I wanted to send, and so on.  Nations acted on their own and independently.  You didn't get influence points for arbitrarily having a certain number of countries on your side.  Why does getting that one last country in a region have such a disproportionate boost?    Most frustrating of all is that the AI seems to entirely lack the sense of fairness that it did in BoP.  The Soviets invade someone in my sphere of influence, they'll refuse to back down, but if I try the same thing, they'll also refuse to back down.  Do they have a death wish?  It seems like I can't get past the first few turns without either being browbeaten into abandoning my allies or ending the game.  There seems to be no spheres of influence, the AI just considers everything fair game and seems to know that I value my time and energy more than it does.  And on the topic of ending the game, I'm really surprised that anything inspired by Balance of Power actually portrayed a nuclear war.

I really wish there were more games like this.\\n\", 'I\\'ll admit; I had high hopes - not because of the pornography, though. You see, I\\'m a huge proponent of strong security. I avoid websites that don\\'t use HTTPS, I ensure all of my passwords are compliant with very high standards (sometimes even combining xkcd\\'s password advice with standard \"best practices\" to wind up with beasts of a password! If only more sites would accept them...) So when I saw this game titled \"Pu*sy Password\", my hopes were that it would fall under the same standards for vagin*l communications as I have for most things - I\\'m talking using nothing short of TLS v1.3, high-grade elliptic curve cryptography, that sort of stuff. And, of course, with strong passwords as well, nothing shy of full compliance with Department of Defense password strength standards, at the absolute minimum.  So let me tell you how disappointed I was when I discovered there was none of this. There was no encryption, no strong password policies - not even any letters! All the passwords were just numbers, and the password hints basically gave away the passwords! I was able to crack most of them without even using a calculator! And the lack of encryption was absolutely unacceptable - a Man in the Middle attack would\\'ve definitely showed anyone on my network all the vagin*l communication that was occurring. The amount of effort that went into the pu*sy security here was abysmal, and it\\'s unfortunate how the product suffered overall as a result. I was hoping to receive a product that could be praised for its strong policies on security and encryption, but instead I only have another example of how security is often overlooked.    ----------------------------- OK, serious review: it\\'s a cheap asset flip and you can find better content for free.

The character creation is quite diverse (like the futa option/gender diversity) and what's offered thus far (positions, traits, customization, backgrounds [as far as showcase goes]) is wonderful. I intend to follow this games progress and, hopefully with a better OS, I can enjoy this game as it develops! Looking forward to sound effects/voice acting (dem lewd noises...) and the gameplay when I can access it. The ONLY suggestion I'd dare to make is camera control: honestly, when we're watching sex we're looking for the penetration.

This is the kind of game that shows massive potential BUT it is also one of those games that could be adandoned at any moment.  As of right now this wouldnt be considered to be enough of a tech demo if you worked AAA and were trying to pitch them the game.  Thats why i suggest waiting a little longer but also buying in before the price goes up.  Im going to return it for now simply out of fear that development will stop before the game gets to a point where its worth the asking price.

In a sense, it\\'s the VR equivalent to Insurgency.   [b] Pros: [/b]  [list]     [*]Contractors has full body IK -- a feature most VR games lack.      [*]Weapon handling is well thought out and intuitive in ways it isn\\'t in other, similar games.     [*]The core game mode, a King of the Hill derivative, is fun.     [*]The developers seem to have spent a lot time playing VRFPS, as is evident in many of the design choices. In some ways, like with the IK, weapon handling, and UI, it feels like it\\'s a \"second generation\" VRFPS.      [*]Overall decent map design.      [*]Visually, it\\'s a bit beyond other VRFPS titles while lagging behind modern pancake shooters (with the exception of PUBG). [/list]  [b] Cons: [/b]  [list]     [*]It\\'s not very well optimized and seems to be CPU bound. The IK is likely the culprit. There\\'s a fair amount of reprojection on my i7 6600k / 1070 no matter what graphics settings I use.      [*]Maps are hit or miss in terms of design. The urban map looks terrible whereas Wild Lands and Cable look fine.      [*]This is a personal preference, but I find the character design and animations to be quite cartoony and the graphics are too bright and colourful.  [/list]  Overall, Contractors VR is a very solid shooter that should improve as time goes on. I believe it\\'s going to be a staple VRFPS for me, much like Onward and Pavlov.\\n', 'Good game 7/10  for its price i think that this game is a complete steal  its horror is on the same ammount of its fun  unless youve watched youtube game plays or know whats going to happen i would recomend it\\n', \"The new area is so aesthetically pleasing it feels like something out of persona.

Why do I care about this cat lady?\" The food you buy gives you some funny dialogue which is funny the first few times, then you realize the shtick and wonder why even try to get all the rest. That dialogue is funny, sure, some witty political and social humor that fits in with what Hat in Time has already established, but why should I care? I have to go out of my way to enjoy it, and not go out of my way in a fun way, you just buy something a few times over. There are some strange political statements that didn\\'t come across as jokes. Like, even the joke in the base game that felt super out of place about, \"no moral cosumption in capitalism\" made more sense in the context of Hat in Time than what they put in. Maybe I just missed something huge about the base game and assumed that the humor and wit was actually dead serious. I feel bad for supporting these devs, honestly. Even Seal the Deal was much more fun to explore. Maybe I just need to play more of Nyakuza to fully get the experience I was meant to. I pre-ordered because I really liked the designs and the world I saw, but I was given something far less than I anticipated. I feel cheated and I will remind myself with this DLC whenever I want to pre-order again. I don\\'t care about online. Stickers are fine. You\\'re gonna buy it to get the full Hat in Time experience, my review won\\'t matter. The last thing this weak DLC needs is a controversy to get its sales up, so don\\'t even bring it up online.

I was bored for the first couple chapters until I realized what the game was actually about, and when I did, it honestly gave me some FEELINGS. I may have cried a little.  This is more of a documentary/learning experience than an actual game. You don't solve any puzzles; you're just learning about the St. Croix River and how it changes over time. I know this sounds really dry when I'm summarizing but I can't adequately convey how valuable this is to see and experience, because--catch 22--if you don't see it yourself you won't really get it. It's one thing to think about deforestation and the theft of native land in the abstract, but when you're confronted with it through a VR-type platform, it really hits you in the gut.  I don't know, I'm still trying to gather my thoughts about this game, but I will say that you should check it out. It's super short so you can even do it on a lunch break or while you're waiting for your laundry or something.

I)  Give us a full party of four characters, I really enjoyed that about MaP and QD only had a single character making it feel like there was something missing  II)  Do more worldbuilding.  MaP had quite a bit of worldbuilding put into it, and all your other titles seem to forget to do that.  It feels more than a bit bizzarre.  III)  Make sure to give the players the ability to speed up messages and sprint.  The sprint one isn't an issue in your current titles but I know some rpgmaker games where they forgot to give the player sprint and it makes the game drag.  IV)  Make sure your plot points don't contradict each other.  The ending for QD really irked me because of that.

Imagine being attacked by a pack of 5  big animals that can slow you down to the point where you pretty much can't go anywhere.    That was pretty bad, but then I decided to go back to The Island, which is the first map. Figured it wouldn't be as bad, surely they couldn't have messed it up further than it was last time I played it with alphas (animals that can pretty much instantly kill you and any of your tames that aren't ridiculously tanky) and the dinosaurs that can almost instantly put you to sleep and actively hunt humans in packs, which are also small, making them more difficult to see/hit.  Well, the game always had raptors at the start which would sometimes be a challenge but not undoable after a few levels. Now they can jump at you from far away and pin you down, meaning you can't attack or move at all (also this happens when you're mounted) so you just die.   Poor balancing and mechanics messed this game up.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The world, especially the DLC worlds look amazing, but fighting enemies that are bullet sponges that can kill you with everything except the strongest armor in the game isn't fun. Power creep is too real of an issue here.   I simply cannot recommend it to anyone, not even people who have friends that are willing to play it with them. Unless you severely change settings (which can be done, timers, resource gain, damage, health, etc, though still makes the game really weird in some places because the settings don't pertain to specific animals, it affects all of them so you could change the timer for taming a brontosaurus from 4 hours to 1 hour but it would make smaller animals tame instnatly), mod the game (easy enough to do with the workshop), and change the mechanics (impossible) to make it so that you don't get killed because of poor game design. Sure, some of the mechanics worked fine before because you could avoid torpor with certain types of items if you were prepared.   Now it's just tank it while spamming left click until either you die or they die. The combat is extremely lack luster and involves left click and w, unless you have a shield, in which case it involves S and right click too.  Don't buy it just because of the videos and screenshots. Yes, the game almost looks as good as that if you have 6+ GB of vRAM and assuming your other specs are amazing too, but most people can't run the game on high. That being said what'll happen is you'll start to enjoy the world  and want to play it more only to be hit by roadblock after roadblock. The game was like this initially, but you get past it and can enjoy more and more of what the game has to offer. Now there are too many cheap mechanics, enemies that do too much damage and tank everything you have unless you have a horde of dinosaurs tamed, and the timers for stuff is ridiculous, causing the game to be too easy in some parts and harder than it has to be in some parts, so you'll find yourself exiting and going back to the main menu a lot to change settings.   Especially when you want to build that gun that costs 95  metal ingots (not an exaggeration, the smithy has a conversion rate of 2 unprocessed metal to 1 ingot as well) only to realize that the bullets cost 1 ingot to make each. Yeah, this game's balancing is abhorrent in every way conceivable.  Unless you're unemployed and aren't going through school you won't have time to build up your base AND protect it in vanilla online servers.  tldr Wildcard is incompetent and doesn't know the meaning of fun and created a game that was  cool but then gradually ruined it\\n\", \"As of right now the game is pretty short but it's still fun. Now it's time to unlock all the achievements.\\n\", \"Woo. I really wanted to like this. It's a game type I love and I was excited by the idea of it. But it's just not there yet. I'm not saying it WON'T be there. I think it will. It just needs more time. I refunded it but will try it again in the future, no doubt, as long as the devs keep working on it.  My major complaints right now: I repeatedly ran into a bug where my hammer would suddenly get stuck in front of me, out of my hand, and I'd be flying backwards and up. No kidding. It happened several times.   Tool swapping is honestly a pain. You should hold the tongs in left hand and hammer in right, and it should just be a thing where you hit a button and pull them out, hit another button to pull out your thermometer, etc. Having to stumble around for my tools on the floor all over the place was frustrating and frantic. And with the game's poor hitbox detection (what a thing to have to say about a game about forging swords) I couldn't reliably grab a pair of tongs and put my ingot on the anvil again before it was too cold to hammer.   The therm would actually be better just built onto the forge itself. Having to try to point it at the tiny sliver of sword in the forge seems silly. Or just make the glowing color system more readable and forget the tool. It doesn't work too well as is.  I despised the minigames. Trying to click right when it hits the right area for handling was... really dumb. It goes so fast I can't even gauge it. It's completely luck. Please give a better system for grinding and handling than really simplistic and stupid, totally immersion breaking minigames?  So reason I quit: I ordered parts and when they got in, I put the handle together on the handling table, then went to forge the blade. When I got the thing ready, all the parts had vanished from the table. Sigh. So I went to order more handle parts... can't. You have to make a whole new sword to order more parts. What?? Neither of these things should have happened.  Also, you start with so little money, ONE messed up sword means you don't have enough money to get more. So there should be some odd jobs. Fix horseshoes, mend swords and stuff. Make pots. Idk. Smithy stuff.  Use that to make some money back to go on making new swords.  I want to love this game. I hope the devs will make it lovable in the future. For now, I can't recommend it because it's just... not finished enough to even really be more than an alpha demo.   Good luck devs.\\n\", 'Hell yeah! Good a$$ game with achievements, great voiceacting (is that even a word?) and okay-ish story. The part i m simply AMAZED about is - absolutely no censorship!

No warmongering!  Cons: This expansions mechanics don\\'t feel very balanced on marathon.  The AI grossly undervalues the new resources gathered; including the new diplomatic points.  I was hoping trade balance had been improved but they still screw you over in any trade.  Any amount of resources over 20 and the AI flips out.  Nuclear reactors blow up approximately every 45 turns (or less) IF they haven\\'t been recommissioned on marathon (it would take me 15 turns to recommission it).  They also have multiple meltdowns which defies logic.  Wouldn\\'t a reactor be offline after a a meltdown rather than keep pumping that radiation out?  YOUR REACTORS WILL STILL MELT DOWN MULTIPLE TIMES AFTER CONVERTING BACK TO OIL POWER TOO!!!!  Trade routes are vulnerable to radiation and cannot be changed; they are also too retarded to avoid fallout from your Oil plant\\'s radiation leaks and meltdowns.  Climate change is kind of cute but seemed skewed since I could get the top tier, by myself, by the mid1900s. It\\'s easiest just to avoid building in flood areas until you get flood walls because, at least for me, climate change is happening and it\\'s not as scary as it should be.  I might go out on a limb and say natural disasters were more often/painful early game.  Carbon Capture\\'s tooltip is also incorrect.  It says you can accumulate reductions against the global CO2 footprint- but jack shit happens when you do it repeatedly past 0 on your counter.  Climate change does not reverse, ever.    I\\'m extra sad that MEGACOLASSAL volcano eruptions don\\'t cause global cooling, as they do IRL. (aka give us this and the option to nuke a volcano to cause cooling on purpose)  It would be annoying, but interesting, to get a mini ice age that affects farms in pre-industrial eras.  Still can\\'t delete awkward districts that AI build, better to still raze the crappier towns if you need the space.  Barbarians are still ridiculous because they are more productive than most towns and respawn the round after you clear them out.  World congress was inconsequential in most circumstances with AI.  The colluded my first game, but worked correctly in my second game.  When an AI wants peace, they are going to ask every round now.  There is no way to block their spam.  Loyalty system is not intuitive i.m.o. and you can lose a town faster than you can establish your governor or conquer it.  I can appreciate needing to strategize how to capture cities, but losing them the round after capture made razing a seksi option.  Bread and Circus is a must.  You can eliminate every civilization WITHOUT getting a domination victory if one of the capitals becomes a \"Free City\".  You still have to manually click future civic and future tech repeatedly.  IF only these could be automatic.  It would also be nice if you stopped accumulating governor points when they are all MAXED.  Military Engineers need a \"Route To\" or Auto improvement option for railroads.  A few thousand extra clicks and hundreds of screen pans to build railroad on a continent is tedious.  Kupe is overpowered AF, IMO.  Gave me a serious run for my money on king difficulty.  Played him next game and started off climate change with a Death Robot and almost all civics found in 1785AD.  Upgrading the Rock Bands with the ability to reduce city loyalty by 50 seemed to break them and make them useless.\\n', \"Never wrote a review in my life so I hope people will have the decency to be gentle on me. Here I go.  So far, this game is a testament to early access done right. The game is loads of fun, and if the final version is even better, then this will be one of the best FPS games in quite some time. The game isn't very difficult, but you will die a lot if you aren't careful. Yes, it's those kinds of difficulties.   Not everything is blue skies and hummingbirds. The game as it currently stands has a few minor bugs, the UI is just a tad cluttered (at least to some people it will be) and the UI around the gun can get in the way of the subtitles sometimes. There are some translation errors as well but not bad enough to make it hard to understand. I also experienced a couple crashes, but had no crashes in my 1st playthrough, so not sure if it was the game or me, but I thought I should point it out in case I'm not the only one. But if these are ironed out in a future update, and the dev nails the English dub should he ever add it, then these aren't really negatives to be concerned about. They're minor at worst anyway. I feel this game is gonna end up being a niche masterpiece if it only gets better from here. And it deserves all the praise and support it gets.   This is already my favorite FPS game of all time. And that's saying a lot. The game has been in development for a few years (someone correct me if I am wrong), by one developer, and is scheduled to release in 2021 from what I've heard.

This game shows promise.  It could be a fun little game with some more work.  But it definitely needs a lot of work and love because as it is now, it only scored about a 4 out of 10 from me.  What's broken:    Collisions:  You character will fall down when just walking into any object what-so-ever.  It's quite funny the first few times, but quickly gets frustrating.  Maybe make it so you fall down only if running over an object, but not when walking.  And make the mice never make you fall down because that is just goofy as hell.  Fighting:  The fighting is complety broken and just not fun.  All you need to do us spam your left mouse button and hope for the best.  Make the fighting interesting.  Gave the player some way to dodge swings by enemies (besides holding up a shield) and make the player weapon collisions better with enemies.  It just needs work because as it is today it just looks and feels stupid silly.  Door Buttons:  Way to hard to find and see.  Make the buttons more obvious as they are sometimes just way to hard to find as they blend into the wall too much  Fix these issues and give the game a little more TLC and you might have a game I can give a recommended score to.

I'm having a lot of fun with it so far. It's basically a bullet hell game, but instead of flying around, you're running, gunning and jumping on platforms. Unlike a lot of bullet hell shooters, where you have to make your way through a whole level to get to the real content, the boss, this game takes you right to the boss fight. And if you die fighting the boss? No worries. You come back right away for another try. You might have to restart the fight, but you're not losing lives and restarting the whole game or anything.  It's a real challenge to begin with, but as you play, you start to learn the patterns each boss has and you get pretty good at it. I'm pretty bad, so this one fight took me 40 minutes of trying before I beat it the first time, now I can do it in two. It makes you feel really good. It might mean that once you've gotten the hang of every boss, you can race through the game, but there are other challenges than just a charging through the bosses.

Also, despite that the game supposedly caters to female domination crowd - in fact that's a false advertisement. Developers just don't understand what this fetish is about (humiliation of man!) so the protagonist behaves just like your typical brazzers actor - as  a proactive and popular stud.

Just because you can crouch doesn't mean it's a stealth game; finding numerous 'upgrades' that don't actually (seem to) affect the gameplay doesn't make it an RPG; throwing in roughly one jump scare doesn't make it a horror game, either. All that does is make this product seem like a cheap grasp for pennies.  There is literally zero backstory of any kind apart from what can be found under About This Game. There's no way of accessing the options after starting the game, in case you want to adjust mouse sensitivity or one of the few other settings. The Steam page claims there's a whopping total of 18 achievements, yet after completing the game not a single one was unlocked. There is no way to save your progression while playing and dying puts you right back at the start, but worry not: you can complete this game in 1 hour. Unless, of course, rolling the credits followed by 'thank you for playing' doesn't mean the game is finished. Ironically, while some people are listed in these credits as voice actors, not a single voice snippet was heard in the entire playthrough. Perhaps they can only be heard in that one skipped building, but maybe some mysteries are just better left unexplained.  Night Fallen is also very poorly optimized, with the frame rate frequently dipping below 20 FPS. The visibility also gets very poor when being (slightly) injured due to the blood splatter overlay. And while it's the least of this game's problems, there are also several typos in the already very few lines of text.

I like that kind of game and that is why i bought it. But there are so many things that are just awful. The graphics are outdated and there is just one small map (for all missions). There are not many sound effects in the game, just a police-radio, which tells you the same thing over and over, and a police siren. No engine sounds or other effects (maybe that is just a bug). The music is ok, but there are not many tracks. The worst part of the game are the ai-drivers, the normal ones and the enemy. I never saw such stupid drivers in a game, they even can not stay on the road. You have to see that for yourself to believe it (watch may video under the text). And on top of that all, the game is not finishable because in one mission, the enemy car is not findable. So my final verdict for the game, buy it if you want to laugh about the most stupid drivers in gaming history, otherwise avoid it.

It is a game depicting the death of the human soul in all its misery and pain. It is a horror game in a very literal sense - rather than attempting to create fear in the player, it is a game about the [i]experience[/i] of fear, the looming, yawning terror at the heart of existence. And yet, in the midst of that sick, sweating mortality is a moving, real story, the story of life and death.  The minute-to-minute gameplay is much like a traditional JRPG, with your party moving from landscape to dying landscape through a terminal brain. The gameplay is not without difficulty, but mechanically it isn't going to keep you up at night.  What will keep you awake, staring at the ceiling at 3am, is the febrile, noise-laden soundtrack, the disturbing artwork and the coffee-bitter writing. Yes, the in-game text has some typos, but this does not detract from the quality of the writing, and in fact shows how unvarnished and real the work is. This is a heartfelt, challenging game.  I'm not an artist. I don't consume a lot of art. I have, however, read that art, real art, should make you uncomfortable. I don't know if that's true, but if it is, this is art.\\n\", 'Vanille game is everything you want as a survival game, enjoyed pvp aswell as pve allott in this game, not a big fan of the dlc`s because i just like old ages more, thats why i recommend the vanille game.  allot of dino`s  building options bosses  Fun with friends but also solo.\\n', 'Nice\\n', 'Really fast and fun.

Please find out how to access the controller binding workshop for this game and try either my or someone else's published controller binding.  My review: 8.5/10 (Could use more players but fun anyway)  It's really something. It's mildly cartoony and the guns have different names, but it's an incredible mashup of almost seductive interaction and tactical elements/features. It encourages you to experiment with cover and positions because of how realistic the damage is.  Comes with a great weapon selection and a fair assortment of accessories. No underbarrel grenade launchers/shotguns yet, though. x)  You'll have a fun time interacting with your weapons and grenades and admiring your big hands! The game's got a great full body VR representation. It's also never been easier to throw a knife!  The player base is a bit small though, last night there were two servers, today there was 6-8. I'd hold off until an update comes and gets everyone excited, but it's well worth the price in every other aspect.  Just a few bits of feedback;  The pump shotgun's controls are a little awkward. I liked what Contagion VR Where you have to hold the gun's grip to hold and pump, I just wish it didn't feel like it was greased to pump with no resistance whatsoever.  It's also a little harder to quickdraw/pick up magazines without looking at them. I'd add a vest organizing and positioning menu.  Also a little laggy even on the lowest settings.  PS: I love the sound effects. Like metal gear but cuter.\\n\", 'I really enjoy this game when it works. WHEN IT WORKS. The biggest issue is with the game suddenly becoming unstable and not running when I try to load into a saved game. Its a huge let down when the hours you put into a game have to be tossed into the garbage when the game decides to just refuse to work UNTIL you delete your saved game.

The new area is fun to play and has a ton of atmosphere, and they definitely listened in terms of the criticism from Seal the Deal. The difficulty is basically just right, most of it is straightforward to manageable while some spots are kinda harrowing. And aside from the Time Rift, they avoided the temptation to include popular characters in it - it's actually all original content. They could stand to tighten up the code quality and hitboxes a little, but eh, it's nothing that wasn't a problem in the game before, so I don't consider that a DLC issue. Overall I'd recommend it highly, it's a worthy addition to the game and put a smile on my face.\\n\", 'Is ther a loc wher I can see all my Characters and their loc map I have lost one one of my main characters and dont know where I built all my loctions.\\n', \"The game is really cute and i love all the designs of the birds and the art is lovely! However, I cannot recommend this game since it lacks a ton of polish, and isn't worth its price tag. Don't get me wrong, the game is cute and i can tell how much passion went into it, but it isn't finished. i do believe these things could improved upon in the future, but for now i'm just gonna write out some issues i had and some recommendations on how the game could be improved. (just my opinion btw.)  -one of the biggest things: music. There is no music in any of the minigames or on the titlescreen. Also hardly any sound effects in the game. There should almost always be some sort of music playing, and sound effects should be EVERYWHERE! when you hover your mouse over buttons, in the minigames, when you click on birds, when you give them treats or hats and a special one plays when you give them one they love!! sound effects!!! everywhere!!!!  -the only games I actually played were the match 3 game and the fruit delivery game. The fruit delivery game was super cute, visually pleasing, and overall really fun. The downside is you don't make any feathers off of it, which kinda makes the game pointless. The match 3 game is cute, but i wish there was more added to make it more exciting (of course music, add a ton of different bird blocks, etc.) all of the other games felt really barebones and boring.   - feathers take waaaaaaaaaay too long to farm.   - The story was cute, but really uninteresting. though i think thats just because i dont care about the characters at all. which is a shame cause i love their designs so much! i felt no connection with them at all and they had almost no personality. yes they have hobbies and quirks but they felt like such a brick wall to talk to. (also im slightly confused on why when talking to them your treated as an actual person in the garden, but at all other times its treated like you dont exsist. i feel more like an observer rather than a person interacting with the characters and birds.)  - just a few minor animation quirks on the birds, and a glitch where id blow my whistle, the new birds would come, id go buy something from the shop only to return to the birds that were there from before i blew my whistle  I feel like so much more personality could be put in this game! So many things could be refined and tweaked and added that would make it stand out so much more!!! but for now, even though its super cute, it feels unfinished and unrefined. I probably wont be opening it again unless some big updates come out.\\n\", \"If You Sayin This Game Aint Worth The $20 Bill. You Either Ain't Got $20 Or You Don't Know How To Skate.  This Game Is Damn Delishish. Don't @ Us.\\n\", 'The new camera is amazing. The option to switch to the original tables is great. There is nothing bad for me to say about this. I love working on a table now and then with the added features of this third iteration. It makes playing tables so much more fun. Best simulation out there for sure. Zen really has the presentation aspects down well. Three tables all worth it. The improved camera for WIlliams table alone is worth it, and they should be putting something like that in for some of their old tables. Great job on these.\\n', 'Bad game.\\n', 'At the time of writing this review I haven\\'t seriously played ARK since mid 2018. I\\'m not going to be bring expansion content into this review, it\\'s just base game. Also, I don\\'t do PvP. Ever.  Getting hooked on ARK is as easy as watching someone else play it. Or just listen to the way I always describe it. \"You wake up naked on a tropical island. There are dinosaurs. Have fun surviving.\" As soon as I saw the game being played, I had to own it.  My first time logging in was memorable. I created a character, chose my starting zone and entered the game. My first thought upon taking a look around was \"those are big teeth.\" My second thought was \"I need to find a zone without any tyrannosaurs in it.\"  Death is common in this game. You will be eaten by small dinosaurs. You will be eaten by big dinosaurs. You will be casually exterminated by packs of dinosaurs. But for every moment you survive, you gain experience. Even the worst strings of luck help you get better.  There are a few mechanics you need to be aware of in this game if you\\'re going to play it. First is food and water. Even the ocean is drinkable in ARK, so water isn\\'t usually a big problem early on. For food, you can kill a dodo even with your bare hands, though you\\'ll need a tool to skin it for meat. Berries are plentiful, but you have to eat a lot of them to stay fed. If the idea of needing to watch your food and water simply to survive bothers you...well, you probably shouldn\\'t be checking out a survival game.  Second is building. Anywhere you go in ARK, you\\'ll want a base. This is particularly true in single player where you won\\'t find friendly forts run by other players. Placing your main base in close proximity to water and major resources like metal is one of the keys to success. Making sure your base is built out of something stronger than thatch is another key. No matter how much sexier it might be to learn how to make a rifle than a stone roof, only one of these things keeps you safe while you\\'re offline. You must learn to build in order to survive.  Third is taming. I hate taming, but it\\'s an absolute necessity in ARK. A single person on foot is vulnerable and prey for many predators. A single person riding a horse can flee from danger. A single person riding a velociraptor can fight back. A single person riding a tyrannosaurus can eat just about anything the island throws at them. If you get really ambitious you can even breed your dinosaurs to get more powerful dinosaurs than can be tamed in the wild. Some people like that. People like me let them get on it with it while we build castles and kill things.  On public servers taming anything worthwhile will take a significant amount of time. This is one of many reasons that unofficial servers are so popular. Accelerated taming rates allow even a solo player to carve out a bit of safety for themselves. I suggest starting out on an official server, but once you have a feel for the game, find a reliable unofficial server. You\\'ll enjoy your time in ARK much more when you\\'re on a server with active moderators.  Not that playing ARK alone lacks enjoyment. You can build whatever you like, there\\'s no competition for building spots or resources and when you leave the world it pauses so you never log back in to find that something has gotten into your base and eaten your egg-laying dodos or other pets.  ARK is an easy game to figure out. Not easy to master, but easy to become proficient enough at. While you\\'ll die a lot before you figure it out, the deaths won\\'t cost you a lot. It\\'s possible to recover your possessions, but whatever you made you can make again. Even losing an entire base, which might happen while you\\'re still building with thatch, won\\'t really set you back.  Everything you do in ARK makes you stronger. Rebuilding a base simply gets you more experience that will make you harder to kill the next time. Replacing weapons is the same. Losing a valued pet hurts, a lot, but you can tame another, or breed better. As you survive, you learn. As you learn, you survive longer.  Buy this game. It\\'s given me countless hours of enjoyment, I\\'ve met many great people and it satisfies both my inner architect and my inner conqueror. There\\'s not much more you can ask of any game. Except maybe human npcs, but no game\\'s perfect.\\n', 'where are they\\n', \"Overall it's alright. Get it after you beat the other modules if you want more content.  It's a bit short and kind of easy, I got through about 3/4ths of the campaign with the starter NetDaemon deck and then built a direct damage deck that carried me through the end. This is in contrast to the base game and the last module where I felt I needed to rotate between three specialized decks to counter the opponents in each mission.  The story isn't much but If you're really interested in the world of System Crash there's some new information. Though if you're hungry for cyberpunk world building I'd just recommend picking up a Shadowrun paperback or something.\\n\", 'A beautiful, deeply and surprisingly moving little game.\\n', \"I'm just going to not recommend this only because there is no mixed and for me personally this is not doing it. I can see others enjoying this dlc.  If you are the type of person that enjoys this game making good looking cites and/or a casual experience then yes its good. The campus areas are more of the same from parklife and industries. The buildings look great and this opens the doors for some amazing looking college focused cities and towns.  I play this game mainly for the traffic and city management... maybe I'm just playing this game wrong because it seems like the devs don't play this way. Building a campus in a city will pretty much print you money. I right now in my current city have a small Campus about 4k students and it generates me 11k profit on hard mode. I feel like this dlc breaks even more the already broken balance in this game. They keep adding these mini game like dlcs while some of the core game play mechanics like tax rates and unemployment that are still left pointless or underwhelming.  I very much enjoy other paradox games like ck2, eu4, and even surviving mars for there layer mechanics and challenging game play. This game falls flat is very easy and quite boring (traffic is great tho). I would very much like to see some cities politics, state/national relations, and some city related crisis out side disasters like economic depressions. This dlc is a glaring example of balance and gameplay being put on the back burner for a more toy model city like game (not that there is anything wrong with that if you like that).\\n\", 'Great value DLC.

Well designed mechanics and interesting concepts of kingship. While the animations and controls are obviously imperfect, this is definitively a step in the right direction. If you enjoy base building games with pawn control and have a VR headset, this is definitely a must have game for you. There are several game-breaking bugs, a number of which come about as a result of the map not functioning as intended, however, it is still my favorite VR game released to date.\\n', \"If there's one thing I love, apart from the thrill of pasta, It's The Haunted Island, a Frog Detective Game.\\n\", \"The game is a great concept I've played it on and off since release the only problem is the poor map design allowing exploitation and poor management.\\n\", 'The final DLC for Shadow of the Tomb Raider encapsulates all the issues with the game:  It\\'s cut content. DLC gunplay segments. Unwhelming \"exploration\". Clearly designed quickly and rushed out.  Honestly this series of DLC have all been small, short Tombs that were clearly cut. The game is \"Tomb Raider\"... But these tombs aren\\'t worth it.  Wouldn\\'t recommend.\\n', \"Nice alternative to Spintires! Not as big and with more focus on off-road aspect. Good maps - and quite diverse. I like the way they keep adding more content - in form of free updates, rather than paid DLCs. Surely has potential to become something great, if they'll keep their current workflow.\\n\", 'Fast paced action with multiple ways to fight. Looking forward to more content.\\n', 'Devs banned an ARK youtuber who made a video to showcase a gamebraking bug in an attempt to get it patched. Absoulutely unnaceptable behavior for the developer of one of the most played games on Steam.\\n', \"Is this worth the bucks? Hell yeah it is, if they just put in some more locations and some park(s) it would be nice. It's a little bit  wonky here and there. But give it some time and if the developers could make the fine adjustments to the game mechanics it's gonna be a new exciting times for skate-fans because i thinks this is very promising.\\n\", 'Physical Exorcist isn\\'t the worst game ever but there just isn\\'t anything really worthwhile within it to bother buying and playing.   The game is very short, taking me only a hour to see pretty much everything it has to offer. Don\\'t take this the wrong way, short games are by no means bad due simply to their length. Usually a game takes this route in an attempt to gain quality over quantity, but there just isn\\'t much quality here.   There are some interesting ideas in the combat system, but none of it is required or even works some of the time (There is a special AOE skill that literally does no damage to any of the four enemies you encounter nor has any other effects). To succeed in this game, simply follow the age old \"Spam ATK = Profit\" formula. You can do other things but they either aren\\'t worth doing or don\\'t work.  The argument can be made that this is a story-driven game and that combat doesn\\'t matter, which I would then question why combat is even in the game but I digress. As for said story, it\\'s cliche and poorly written (The characters in-game even joke about the cliche story. Being self-aware doesn\\'t excuse the flaws, Dev). Bullied kid commits suicide, becomes evil ghost, haunts bullies. Woah, truly visionary work. The poor writing is also largely due to the absolutely horrible localization. Localizing something is more than just simply translating text.    There are some funny moments, good art, and promising ideas but nothing really worth spending 2.99 on. I\\'d be interested in seeing what the Dev can do in the future with some more practice, time, and possibly a team but, as for this product, just spend your money on a bag of chips instead. You\\'re not missing out on anything.\\n', 'Mistakes were made on that fateful day, one being me buying this game as a joke, the other me downloading the R18 patch, and the last me being late to work because I did those things...  Twas pretty funny, until the H-scene, then my straight sense was like nope nope nope  If you are gay, or whatever makes you like traps, it is good game, if not, uh, go back to Nekopara\\n', \"An incredible expansion. I've probably got 2,500 collective hours with Civ since Civ 4, and this expansion marks the absolute pinnacle of the series for me. It's a beautiful intersection of fearless design choices and thematics. And at long last...  THE LATE GAME DOESN'T SUCK.  On the contrary, I'm EXCITED to play the late game now. They also seem to have addressed some late game performance issues, too, to make it even more smooth. Managing climate, electricity, etc. is so satisfying. Diplomacy actually makes sense now, but dicks will still try to nab low-hanging fruit if you leave a city vulnerable. If you strengthen your position enough, even warmongers will buddy up to you.  I'm a die-hard fan of Dido from Civ 5 and her (authentic) return as the leader of Phoenicia in this DLC is just amazing.  For those complaining about price, I paid $30 for Starcraft: Brood War in 1997. Inflation has risen considerably since then.  This is not a 'DLC' it is a full-on expansion, just like they used to make them. Only the most determined curmudgeons will be disappointed with Gathering Storm. Well, them and climate-change deniers. I think there might be some overlap there, anyways.\\n\", 'It was good, but it was short. The game has new features and new sound effects which makes the game fresh. The Halloween theme and Halloween sound effects are funny, I could play with the halloween pumpkin sound effect in the menu for minutes. :D Big thumbs up for the game!

It is massively inefficient to one-hot encode that many classes. So, instead of one-hot encoding, we can have an embedding layer and use that layer as a lookup table. You could train an embedding layer using Word2Vec, then load it here. But, it's fine to just make a new layer, using it for only dimensionality reduction, and let the network learn the weights.\n",
